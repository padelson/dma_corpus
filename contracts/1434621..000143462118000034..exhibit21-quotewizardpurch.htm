any withholding on any compensatory payments made in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer shall notify the
Securityholder Representative of any amounts that it intends to deduct and
withhold at least three (3) Business Days prior to the scheduled date of such
payment, and Buyer shall work in good faith with the Securityholder
Representative to minimize any such withheld amounts. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Buyer, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made, and the Buyer shall disburse

being understood that in no event shall the aggregate amounts payable to the
Members and the Optionholders on the Closing Date as set forth in the Closing
Date Payment Schedule exceed the amounts payable pursuant to Section 1.6(g)
and Section 1.6(f), respectively). None of Buyer, the Group Companies (after
the Closing), or their respective Affiliates (other than the Securityholder
Representative to the extent constituting an Affiliate) shall have any
liability or obligation with respect to the allocation or payment of such
amounts (other than pursuant to Section 2.3 and Section 2.4), including the
determination of the amounts set forth on the Closing Date Payment Schedule,
and each of Buyer and the Group Companies (after the Closing) shall be fully
discharged from any liability to any Member, Optionholder or any of their
Affiliates in connection with such payment.

(d) The Company and the Securityholder Representative shall consider in good
faith all comments provided by Buyer with respect to the statements and
estimates delivered pursuant to this Section 2.2.

Section 2.3. Post-Closing Determination.

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Securityholder Representative a
written statement (the "Closing Statement") that shall include a consolidated

accordance with the Accounting Principles, a statement of the Net Adjustment
Amount, and a calculation of the following:

(i) the Closing Company Transaction Expenses;

(ii) the Closing Funded Indebtedness;

(iii) the Closing Cash on Hand; and

(iv) the Closing Working Capital.

(b) During the thirty (30)-day period following Buyer's delivery of the
Closing Statement to the Securityholder Representative (the "Review Period"),
Buyer shall provide the Securityholder Representative and his Representatives
reasonable access to the relevant books and records and employees of the Group
Companies for the purpose of facilitating the Securityholder Representative's
review of the Closing Statement. The Closing Statement shall become final and
binding on the parties at the end of the last day of the Review Period, unless
prior to the end of the Review Period, the Securityholder Representative
delivers to Buyer a written notice of disagreement (a "Notice of
Disagreement") specifying the nature and amount of any and all items in
dispute as to the amounts set forth in the Closing Statement. The
Securityholder Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all items
and amounts in the Closing Statement not specifically referenced in a Notice
of Disagreement provided prior to the end of the Review Period.

(c) During the thirty (30)-day period following delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement by the Securityholder Representative to Buyer (the "Resolution
Period"), such parties in good faith shall seek to resolve in writing any
differences that they may have with respect to the computation of the amounts
as specified therein. Any disputed items resolved in writing between the
Securityholder Representative and Buyer within the Resolution Period shall be
final and binding on the parties for all purposes hereunder. If the
Securityholder Representative and Buyer have not resolved all such differences
by the end of the Resolution Period, the Securityholder Representative and
Buyer shall submit, in writing, such differences to the Accounting Expert in a
jurisdiction mutually agreed upon by the Securityholder Representative and the
Buyer (or if such parties are unable to agree, then in a jurisdiction selected
by the Neutral Accounting Firm). The "Accounting Expert" shall be a Neutral
Accounting Firm selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and the Securityholder
Representative; provided, however, that: (i) if, within fifteen (15) days
after the end of the Resolution Period, such parties are unable to agree on a
Neutral Accounting Firm to act as the Accounting Expert, then each party shall
select a Neutral Accounting Firm and such firms together shall select the
Neutral Accounting Firm to act as the Accounting Expert, and (ii) if any party does not select a
Neutral Accounting Firm within ten (10) days of written demand therefor by the
other party, then the Neutral Accounting Firm selected by the other party
shall act as the Accounting Expert. A "Neutral Accounting Firm" means an
independent accounting firm of nationally recognized standing that is not at
the time it is to be engaged hereunder rendering services to any party, or any
Affiliate of either, and has not done so within the two (2) year-period prior
thereto.

(d) The parties shall arrange for the Accounting Expert to agree in its
engagement letter to act in accordance with this Section 2.3(d). Each party
shall present a brief to the Accounting Expert (which brief shall also be
concurrently provided to the other party) within twenty (20) days of the
appointment of the Accounting Expert detailing such party's views as to the
correct nature and amount of each item remaining in dispute from the Notice of
Disagreement (and for the avoidance of doubt, no party may introduce a dispute
to the Accounting Expert that was not originally set forth on the Notice of
Disagreement). Within ten (10) days of receipt of the brief, the receiving
party may present a responsive brief to the Accounting Expert (which
responsive brief shall also be concurrently provided to the other party). Each
party may make an oral presentation to the Accounting Expert (in which case,
such presenting party shall notify the other party of such presentation, and
the other party shall have the right to be present (but not speak) at such
presentation), within thirty (30) days of the appointment of the Accounting
Expert. The Accounting Expert shall have the opportunity to present written
questions to either party, a copy of which shall be provided to the other
party. The Accounting Expert shall consider only those items and amounts in
the Securityholder Representative's and Buyer's respective calculations that
are identified as being items and amounts to which the Securityholder
Representative and Buyer have been unable to agree. In resolving any disputed
item, the Accounting Expert shall select either the position of Buyer or
Securityholder Representative as a resolution for each item or amount disputed
and may not impose an alternative resolution with respect to any item or
amount disputed. The Accounting Expert shall make a written determination
within sixty (60) days of its appointment as to each such disputed item, which
determination shall be final and binding on the parties for all purposes
hereunder absent manifest error. The fees and expenses of the Accounting
Expert and of any enforcement of the determination thereof, shall be borne by
(i) the Securityholders, (A) jointly and severally to the extent of the
Representative Expense Fund, and thereafter, (B) on a joint and several basis
as among the Key Members (up to the sum of the Key Members' aggregate
Securityholder Pro Rata Shares), and on a several (and not joint) basis as to
the Securityholders other than the Key Members in accordance with their
respective Securityholder Pro Rata Share, on the one hand, and (ii) Buyer, on
the other hand, in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters
resolved by the Accounting Expert, which proportionate allocation shall be
calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the
amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the Accounting Expert at the
time the determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the matters
submitted.

Section 2.4. Payment.

(a) The "Net Adjustment Amount" shall equal zero (0):

(i) minus the amount, if any, by which the Closing Company Transaction
Expenses exceed the Estimated Closing Company Transaction Expenses;

(ii) plus the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing Company
Transaction Expenses exceed the Closing Company Transaction Expenses;

(iii) minus the amount, if any, by which the Closing Funded Indebtedness
exceeds the Estimated Closing Funded Indebtedness;

(iv) plus the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing Funded
Indebtedness exceeds the Closing Funded Indebtedness;

(v) minus the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing Cash on Hand
exceeds the Closing Cash on Hand;

(vi) plus the amount, if any, by which the Closing Cash on Hand exceeds the
Estimated Closing Cash on Hand; (vii) minus the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing Working Capital
exceeds the Closing Working Capital; and

(viii) plus the amount, if any, by which the Closing Working Capital exceeds
the Estimated Closing Working Capital.

(b) If the Net Adjustment Amount as finally determined in accordance with
Section 2.3 is positive, Buyer and the Securityholder Representative shall
deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to deliver to the Securityholders (in accordance with their respective
Additional Pro Rata Shares) the Adjustment Escrow Amount as set forth herein
and Buyer shall pay the Net Adjustment Amount to the Securityholders (in
accordance with their respective Additional Pro Rata Shares) as set forth
herein. If the Net Adjustment Amount as finally determined in accordance with
Section 2.3 is negative and the absolute value of the Net Adjustment Amount is
less than the Adjustment Escrow Amount, Buyer and the Securityholder
Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver (i) to Buyer, the absolute value of
the Net Adjustment Amount, and (ii) to the Securityholders (in accordance with
their respective Additional Pro Rata Shares) the difference between the
Adjustment Escrow Amount and the absolute value of the Net Adjustment Amount
as set forth herein. If the Net Adjustment Amount as finally determined in
accordance with Section 2.3 is negative and the absolute value of the Net
Adjustment Amount is equal to or greater than the Adjustment Escrow Amount,
Buyer and the Securityholder Representative shall deliver a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver to
Buyer the Adjustment Escrow Amount and, if the absolute value of the Net
Adjustment Amount is greater than the Adjustment Escrow Amount, the difference
between the absolute value of the Net Adjustment Amount and the Adjustment
Escrow Amount (such difference, the "Shortfall Amount") shall be paid to Buyer
in the following manner and priority: first, as a setoff against any Earnout
payment that is payable but not yet paid and second, directly by the
Securityholders, on a joint and several basis as among the Key Members (up to
the sum of the Key Members' aggregate Securityholder Pro Rata Shares), and on
a several (and not joint) basis as to the Securityholders other than the Key
Members in accordance with their respective Securityholder Pro Rata Share;
provided, however, that Buyer may, in its sole discretion, choose to satisfy
all or any part of the Shortfall Amount from the Indemnity Escrow Amount in
lieu of following such order of payment. Payments shall be made and joint
written instructions shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent, in each case
within five (5) Business Days of final determination of the Net Adjustment
Amount pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.4(b). Payments shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or
accounts as may be designated in writing by the party entitled to such payment
at least two (2) Business Days prior to such payment date; provided, however,
that any such amount payable to the Securityholders (whether by Buyer or from
the Adjustment Escrow Amount) shall be paid (x) in the case of the Members, to
the Securityholder Representative for further distribution to each
Securityholder in accordance with each Securityholder's Additional Pro Rata
Share and (y) in the case of Optionholders, to the Company for payment to the
Optionholders (less applicable withholding and any Taxes required to be paid
by the Group Companies with respect thereto) in accordance with such
Optionholders' Additional Pro Rata Share on or before the next regularly
scheduled payroll date.

(c) Any adjustments made pursuant to this Article 2 shall be deemed
adjustments to the Purchase Price.

Section 2.5. Earnout.

(a) Within sixty (60) days after the end of each of the First Earnout Period,
the Second Earnout Period and the Third Earnout Period, Buyer shall prepare
and deliver to the Securityholder Representative a written statement (each an
"Earnout Statement"), which, for the avoidance of doubt, will include each of
the components set forth on the Base Plan Schedule, setting forth its
calculation of the Adjusted EBITDA for such period in accordance with the Base
Plan Schedule, compared against the Earnout calculation for the applicable
Earnout Period set forth on Schedule 2.5 attached hereto (the "Base Plan
Schedule"). For purposes of clarity, nothing in the Base Plan Schedule shall
alter the Adjusted EBITDA targets set forth in Schedule 2.5(c).Within thirty
(30) days following delivery by Buyer of an Earnout Statement, the
Securityholder Representative shall deliver written notice to Buyer of any
good faith disagreement that the Securityholder Representative has with
respect to the contents thereof which notice explains, in reasonable detail,
the basis for its disagreement. During such period, Buyer shall provide the
Securityholder Representative and his Representatives reasonable access to the relevant books
and records and employees of the Group Companies for the purpose of
facilitating the Securityholder Representative's review of the applicable
Earnout Statement. In the event that the Securityholder Representative does
not notify Buyer in writing of a disagreement with respect to the Earnout
Statement within such thirty (30)-day period, such Earnout Statement shall be
deemed final, conclusive and binding on the parties. If the Securityholder
Representative delivers a notice of disagreement within such thirty (30)-day
period, then Buyer and the Securityholder Representative shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve any such disagreement. If Buyer and the Securityholder
Representative, notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail to resolve such
disagreement within thirty (30) days after the Securityholder Representative
notifies Buyer of its disagreement, then the dispute shall be submitted for
final and binding resolution to the Accounting Expert for resolution in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Sections 2.3(c) and (d), which
shall apply hereto mutatis mutandis.

(b) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall be paid within five
(5) Business Days from the date on which the Adjusted EBITDA for the pertinent
period is finally determined, by wire transfer of immediately available funds:
(a) with respect to the Members, to the Securityholder Representative for
further distribution to each Member in accordance with each Member's
Additional Pro Rata Share and (b) with respect to the Optionholders, to the
Company to be paid by the Company to the applicable Optionholders (less
applicable withholding and any Taxes required to be paid by the Group
Companies with respect thereto) on or before the next regularly scheduled
payroll date following such payment in accordance with each Securityholder's
Additional Pro Rata Share. Buyer shall have no right to withhold and set off
any amounts owed by the Member to Buyer under the terms of this Agreement
against amounts payable pursuant to this Section, except as contemplated by
Section 2.4(b) and Article 8.

(c) During each Earnout Period:

(i) Buyer shall operate the Business in good faith consistent with the manner
in which Buyer operates its other acquired business units, applicable Law and
its third-party obligations;

(ii) Buyer shall operate the Group Companies as a separate profit center,
business unit or division which will maintain separate books and records
sufficient for the calculation of the Earnout, provided that Buyer may, at its
discretion, move or integrate certain corporate functions of the Business
(including with respect to corporate, finance, human resources and legal
functions), and allocate the applicable expenses of any Group Company to Buyer
or Buyer Parent instead. For purposes of determining the appropriate sharing
of revenue for transactions between the Buyer and the Group Companies, (A) the
Group Companies will be allocated sixty five percent (65%) of revenue
generated and recognized by Buyer, Buyer Parent or their respective Affiliates
(other than the Group Companies) or their respective business divisions (other
than the Business) as a result of cross-marketing or referrals from the Group
Companies and/or the Business and (B) Buyer will be allocated sixty five (65%)
of revenue generated and recognized by any Group Company or the Business as a
result of cross-marketing or referrals from Buyer, Buyer Parent or their
respective Affiliates (other than the Group Companies) or their respective
business divisions (other than the Business); and

(iii) Buyer shall not, or permit its Affiliates to, take any action, or
knowingly omit to take any action, with the primary intent of impeding
achievement of or reducing the amount of the Earnout.

(d) If, prior to the end of the Earnout Period, Buyer effects a Company Sale
at a price that is equal to or greater than the price actually paid pursuant
to this Agreement (as adjusted for partial sales), then the maximum amount of
the Earnout payments contemplated in Section 2.5(c) for the period in which
the Company Sale occurs and any future periods (but not any past periods) (the
"Outstanding Earnout Payment") shall be accelerated and become due and payable
without further action required on the part of any party hereto. In the event
of such acceleration, Buyer shall make (or cause the applicable acquirer or
surviving company to make) the Outstanding Earnout Payment within two (2)
Business Days following the consummation of a Company Sale. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Company Sale" means any transaction or series of transactions
pursuant to which any Person, other than Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer,
acquires, directly or indirectly: (i) 50% or more of the outstanding equity,
voting securities or beneficial ownership of the Group Companies (whether by
merger, consolidation, reorganization, combination, amalgamation, sale,
transfer or otherwise) or (ii) a majority of the assets of the Group
Companies, determined on a consolidated basis. For purposes of clarity,
Company Sale shall not include indirect acquisitions of the Group Companies' equity and/or assets effectuated by the acquisition of the equity
and/or assets of Buyer or its Affiliates (other than the Group Companies or a
holding company substantially all of the assets of which are the equity
interests of the Group Companies) or minority investments in the Group
Companies.

maintained in a manner that would not void or limit the coverage of any
warranty thereon, other than items currently under, or scheduled for, repair

annual license fee not exceeding $2,000), and (ii) owned by a Group Company
that is used by any other Person (items (i) and (ii), collectively, "Licensed
Intellectual Property;" such licenses, sublicenses, agreements or permissions,
together with all amendments, modifications and supplements thereto, "IP
Licenses"). The Company has delivered to Buyer true and complete copies of all
IP Licenses. No Group Company is in breach of or in default (whether with or
without the giving of notice, passage of time or both) under any IP Licenses
or in respect of any Licensed Intellectual Property, and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, no counterparty to any IP License is in breach or default
(whether with or without the giving of notice, passage of time or both) under
or in respect of any such IP License or Licensed Intellectual Property.

(c) Schedule 4.13(c) sets forth a list of all proprietary Software that is
owned or purported to be owned by any of the Group Companies (the "Company
Software"). All right, title and interest in and to the Company Software is
owned by a Group Company free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted
Liens (excluding restrictions imposed by any license agreements disclosed on
Schedule 4.13(b) with any Licensed Intellectual Property as described in
subsection (ii) in such definition). The Company Software, and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, the other Software used by any Group Company, is
free from and the Group Companies take commercially reasonable steps to ensure
it remains free from any disabling codes or instructions and any "back door,"
"time bomb," "Trojan horse," "worm," "drop dead device," "virus" or other
software routines or hardware components that permit unauthorized access or
the unauthorized disruption, impairment, disablement or erasure of such
Company Software or any computer or system on which such Company Software is
installed or connected to. The Group Companies are in possession of both the
executable object code and source code versions of all Company Software, and
all Company Software conforms in all respects to, and functions in accordance
with applicable operating manuals, user manuals, training materials, formal
specifications, and formal compatibility and configuration instructions
relating to such software.

party Software that is used in or necessary to the conduct of the business of
the Group Companies, and is in compliance in all material respects with the
requirements thereof, and such licenses will remain in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms immediately following the Closing. No Group
Company has used, modified or distributed any Publicly Available Software in a
manner that requires any Company Software to be: (i) disclosed or distributed
in source code form, (ii) licensed for the purpose of making derivative works
or (iii) redistributed at no charge.

(e) No written claim has been brought or made against any Group Company: (i)
alleging that their use of any Intellectual Property infringes on or
misappropriates the Intellectual Property of, or otherwise violates the rights
of, another Person, including any request that they take a license under or
pay any consideration in respect of any Intellectual Property of another
Person; (ii) challenging the ownership, right to use or validity of the
Company Intellectual Property or the right to use or validity of any Licensed
Intellectual Property; or (iii) opposing or attempting to cancel such Group
Company's rights in any Intellectual Property. No Action is pending, or to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened, against or involving any Group Company
with respect to any Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of the Company, no
Person is infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise violating the rights
of any Group Company in the Company Intellectual Property or other
Intellectual Property owned by any Group Company. The conduct of the business
of the Group Companies, including use of the Company Intellectual Property in
connection therewith, has not infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise
violated and does not infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate the
Intellectual Property or other rights of any Person. (f) No current or former employee or contractor of any Group Company has any
right to payment with respect to the Group Companies' use of any Company
Intellectual Property, or any right of ownership with respect to any Company
Intellectual Property. Each current or former employee or contractor of any
Group Company that has contributed to the conception or development of any
Company Intellectual Property and any other Intellectual Property used by the
Group Companies has executed a valid and binding agreement assigning all
rights in such Company Intellectual Property to a Group Company, which
agreement is valid and binding against the applicable Group Company and, to
the Company's Knowledge, the other party thereto, and has irrevocably waived
in writing any non-assignable rights (including moral rights) that such Person
may possess with respect to such Company Intellectual Property.

(g) Each Group Company has taken commercially reasonable measures to protect
the confidentiality of their Company Intellectual Property and other
proprietary information, including Trade Secrets, the value of which is
contingent upon maintaining the confidentiality thereof, and of third party
confidential information provided to any Group Company under an obligation of
confidentiality. No Company Intellectual Property constituting a Trade Secret
or Confidential Information has been authorized to be disclosed or has been
disclosed by any Group Company other than pursuant to a binding and
enforceable nondisclosure agreement or other obligation of confidentiality
restricting the disclosure and use thereof. To the Company's Knowledge, no
Person has breached any such nondisclosure agreement or other obligation of
confidentiality to any Group Company.

Property owned by the Group Companies and the Licensed Intellectual Property,
includes all of the Intellectual Property used in the operation of the
businesses of the Group Companies as currently conducted.

of the Privacy Commitments, applicable privacy Laws and privacy Contracts to
which any Group Company is a party. Each Group Company has at all times: (i)
provided adequate notice and obtained any necessary consents from end users
required for the processing of personal data as conducted by or for such Group
Company and (ii) abided by any privacy choices (including opt-out preferences)
of end users relating to personal data (such obligations along with those
contained in the Group Companies' privacy policies, collectively, "Privacy
Commitments"). None of (A) the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement or (B) the use by Buyer of any of the Group Companies' databases or
data or other information relating to the Business' customers in the same
manner in which they are currently used by the Group Companies will cause,
constitute, or result in a breach or violation of any privacy Laws or Privacy
Commitments, any Contracts to which any Group Company is a party or standard
terms of service entered into by users of the Group Companies' websites.

(j) Each Group Company has established and maintains appropriate technical,
physical and organizational measures and security systems and technologies in
compliance with privacy Laws and Privacy Commitments that are designed to
protect its data against accidental or unlawful processing in a manner
reasonable and appropriate to the risks represented by the processing of such
data by the Group Companies and its data processors. There has been no breach,
security incident or violation of any data security policy in relation to the
any Group Company's data has occurred, and there has been no unauthorized or
illegal processing of any such data such that: (i) privacy Laws would require
any Group Company to notify a Governmental Authority of a data security breach
or security incident or (ii) applicable guidance or codes of practice
promulgated under privacy Laws would recommend any Group Company to notify a
Governmental Authority of a data security breach.

investigation by the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor or any other
Governmental Authority. Nothing has occurred with respect to any Benefit Plan
that has subjected or could reasonably be expected to subject any Group
Company to a penalty under Section 502(i) of ERISA or to an excise Tax under
Section 4975 of the Code, which penalty or Tax has not been resolved in full.

(e) Neither any Group Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever sponsored,
maintained, or contributed to any Benefit Plan that is: (i) a "pension plan"

the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS, or with
respect to a prototype or volume submitter plan, can rely on an opinion or
advisory letter from the IRS issued to the prototype plan sponsor, and, to the
Company's Knowledge nothing has occurred that could reasonably be expected to
cause the revocation of such determination letter or the unavailability of
reliance on such opinion or advisory letter, as applicable.

(g) None of the Benefit Plans provide for or promise retiree medical or life
insurance benefits to any current or former Employee, officer, or director of
the Group Companies, other than (i) to the extent required by applicable Law,

proposed and final regulations), and to the Company's Knowledge no amounts
deferred under any such plan are, or upon vesting will be, subject to the
interest and additional Tax set forth under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code.
Neither any Group Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any indemnity or gross-
up obligation to any Person for any Taxes or penalties imposed under Sections

with the prior consent of, Buyer (with respect to disclosures by the Group
Companies, the Securityholder Representative, the Securityholders or their
respective Affiliates or Representatives) or the Securityholder Representative
(with respect to disclosures by Buyer or its Affiliates or Representatives) or
(5) in connection with any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement or any

promptly notify Buyer (with respect to disclosures by the Group Companies, the
Securityholder Representative or the Securityholders) or the Securityholder
Representative (with respect to disclosures by Buyer) in writing to the extent
permitted by Law, which notification shall include the nature of the legal
requirement and the extent of the required disclosure, and such Person shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer or the Securityholder Representative, as
applicable (at such Person's expense) to preserve the confidentiality of such
information consistent with applicable Law.

(b) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby incorporated herein
by reference and shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at
which time the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. If this Agreement is
terminated prior to the Closing, then the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

Section 6.5. Exclusive Dealing. During the period from the date hereof through
the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement, neither any Group
Company nor the Securityholder Representative or any Member shall, and cause
each of their respective controlled Affiliates and Representatives not to, and

respective uncontrolled Affiliates and Representatives and other
Securityholders other than the Members not to, directly or indirectly,
solicit, encourage, initiate, participate in, facilitate, enter into or engage
in discussions, negotiations, agreements or other arrangements with any Person

of the equity interests (excluding compensatory equity interests issuable to
employees) of, or sale of all or a significant portion of the assets of
(including by merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or
otherwise), any Group Company. Each Group Company, the Securityholder
Representative and each Member shall, and shall cause each of their respective
Affiliates and Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any and all contacts, discussions, negotiations with any Person
relating to any transaction described in the foregoing sentence (other than
Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives), and promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours) notify Buyer of the receipt of any verbal or written
submissions, proposals or offers, in each case, regarding the foregoing.

Section 6.6. Non-Competition.

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth
(5th) anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Non-Competition Period"), each
Member set forth on Schedule 6.6(a) (each, a "Restricted Member") shall not,
and shall cause each of his, her or its controlled Affiliates not to, directly
or indirectly, (i) acquire, own, manage, operate, join, control, participate
in the ownership, management, operation or control of or engage in, consult

Affiliate of Buyer or Buyer Parent) that engages anywhere in the United States
of America (the "Restricted Territory") in the Business or (ii) become
employed by or otherwise render personal services to any Person in the
Business; provided, however, that such Restricted Member and his, her or its
controlled Affiliates shall not be prohibited from owning up to five percent
(5%) of the outstanding stock of a corporation that is publicly traded on a
national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market so long as such
Restricted Member or his, her or its Affiliate, as applicable, has no active
participation in connection with the business of such corporation.

(b) During the Non-Competition Period, such Restricted Member shall not, and
shall cause each of his, her or its controlled Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, solicit, offer employment to or hire any individual that is an
employee of any Group Company or otherwise induce or attempt to induce
(whether for their own account or for the account of any other Person) any individual that is an employee of
any Group Company to leave the employ of such Group Company; provided,
however, that nothing in this Section 6.6(b) shall prohibit any such party
from: (i) using general solicitations (including through search firms) not
targeted at employees of any Group Company, or employing any person who
responds to such solicitation; (ii) hiring, employing or discussing employment
with any person who contacts such party independently without any
solicitations by such party and (iii) soliciting any person who has left the
employment of a Group Company at least six (6) months prior to such party
soliciting such person.

(c) During the Non-Competition Period, such Restricted Member shall not, and
shall cause each of his, her or its controlled Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, induce or attempt to induce any then-existing customer, supplier,
licensee or other business relation of any Group Company to cease doing
business with such Group Company or in any way interfere with the relationship
between any such customer, supplier, licensee or business relation and any
Group Company.

(d) From and after the Closing for a period of five (5) years, each Member
agrees not to disclose or use (and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to
use or disclose at any time) any Confidential Information (except with respect
to Trade Secrets, which each Member agrees not to disclose or use in
perpetuity); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit
disclosure of any such information (i) if required by applicable Law; (ii) as
required in order to fulfill such Member's obligations under this Agreement;
(iii) to a financial, legal or accounting advisor for the purpose of advising
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents (provided, that such advisor is made aware of and
directed to comply with the provisions of this Section 6.6(d)); (iv) to the
extent that the information has been made public by, or with the prior consent
of, Buyer or Buyer Parent; or (v) to the extent necessary in connection with
any Action with respect to this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents.
In the event any Member or any of its Affiliates is required by Law to
disclose any Confidential Information, such Member shall promptly notify Buyer
in writing to the extent permitted by Law, which notification shall include
the nature of the legal requirement and the extent of the required disclosure,
and such Member shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer and its Affiliates (at
Buyer's expense) to preserve the confidentiality of such information
consistent with applicable Law.

(e) The obligations contained in this Section 6.6 shall be construed as a
series of separate covenants, one for each country, province, state, city or
other political subdivision of the Restricted Territory. If any of such
separate covenants (or any part thereof) is deemed invalid or unenforceable,
Buyer and such Member agree that such invalid or unenforceable covenant (or
such part) shall be eliminated from this Agreement to the extent necessary to
permit the remaining separate covenants (or portions thereof) to be enforced.
If any of the provisions of this Section 6.6 are deemed to exceed the time,
geographic or scope limitations permitted by applicable Law, Buyer and such
Member agree that such provisions shall be reformed to the maximum time,
geographic or scope limitations, as the case may be, permitted by applicable
Law.

Section 6.7. Release.

(a) Each Member, on behalf of himself, herself or itself, such Member's
Affiliates, and their respective successors and assigns (collectively, the
"Releasors"), hereby knowingly and voluntarily releases and forever
discharges, effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer, the Company, Wizard
Enterprises and each of their respective past, present and/or future
Affiliates and Representatives (collectively, the "Released Parties"), from
any and all Actions, claims, suits, controversies, causes of action, cross-
claims, counter claims, demands, debts, compensatory damages, liquidated
damages, punitive or exemplary damages, other damages, claims for costs and
attorneys' fees, or liabilities of any nature whatsoever in law and in equity,
whether known or unknown, liquidated or contingent, which such Member or any
other Releasor ever had or now have relating to, arising out of or in any way
connected with the dealings of the Company, Wizard Enterprises or the other
Released Parties, on the one hand, and such Member and the other Releasors, on
the other hand, or any circumstance, agreement, action, omission, event or
matter occurring or existing between them, in each case, prior to the Closing
Date (collectively, the "Released Claims"); provided, however, that the
Released Claims shall not include: (i) any matters arising under or relating
to the terms, conditions or other provisions or obligations under this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, including, for the avoidance of doubt, rights to indemnification
under the Company's Organizational Documents contemplated in Section 6.11,
(ii) rights to any accrued but unpaid compensation owed by a Group Company to
any Member or other Releasor as of the Closing and that is reflected in the
Closing Working Capital or included in the Closing Company Transaction
Expenses, (iii) rights to any accrued but unpaid business expenses of the
Members to the extent that such expenses are incurred and reimbursable under
the Group Companies' existing company policies or (iv) rights under any
Benefit Plan maintained, contributed to or sponsored by any Group Company as
of the Closing.

(b) Each Member acknowledges that the Laws of many states provide
substantially the following:

"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

Each Member acknowledges that such provisions are designed to protect a party
from waiving claims which he, she or it does not know exist or may exist.
Nonetheless, each Member agrees that, effective as of the Closing Date, such
Member and the other Releasors shall be deemed to waive any such provision.

(c) Each Member further agrees that no party shall, nor permit any Affiliate
thereof to: (i) institute a lawsuit or other legal proceeding based upon,
arising out of, or relating to any of the Released Claims, (ii) participate,
assist, or cooperate in any such proceeding or (iii) encourage, assist and/or
solicit any third party to institute any such proceeding.

Section 6.8. Access to Records after Closing. For a period of seven (7) years
after the Closing Date, the Securityholder Representative and his
Representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records
of the Group Companies, to the extent that such access may reasonably be
required in connection with matters relating to or affected by the operations
of the Group Companies prior to the Closing Date, including the preparation of
the Members' financial reports or Tax Returns, any Tax audits, the defense or
prosecution of Actions (other than disputes against Buyer and its Affiliates),
and any other reasonable need of the Members or Securityholder Representative
to consult such books and records. Such access shall be afforded by Buyer upon
receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours. If
Buyer or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, shall desire to
dispose of any of such books or records prior to the expiration of such seven
(7)-year period, Buyer shall, prior to such disposition, notify the
Securityholder Representative in writing and give the Securityholder
Representative a reasonable opportunity (at the Members' expense), but in no
event less than thirty (30) Business Days, to segregate and remove such books
and records as the Securityholder Representative may select.

Section 6.9. Tax Matters.

(a) At the sole expense of the Members, the Securityholder Representative
shall cause to be prepared all income Tax Returns required to be filed by any
Group Company for taxable periods ending prior to or on the Closing Date which
are to be filed after the Closing Date (the "Member Returns"). Each such
Member Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Group
Companies' past practice and in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, except as otherwise required by Law; and the Members shall timely
pay any Taxes reflected as due and payable on all such Tax Returns to the
extent that such Taxes are not reflected as a liability in the calculation of
Closing Working Capital, as finally determined. The Securityholder
Representative shall deliver to Buyer, for Buyer's review and comment, each
such Member Return at least forty-five (45) days prior to its due date (or if
such Member Return is due in fewer than forty-five (45) days after the Closing
Date, then as soon after the Closing Date as is reasonably practicable). Buyer
shall provide written comments on each such Member Return within fifteen (15)
days of receipt of such Member Return. If Buyer notifies the Securityholder
Representative of any disagreement with such Member Return, then the parties
shall attempt to resolve such disagreement through good-faith negotiation and
if, within the ensuing fifteen (15) days, the parties are unable to resolve
their disagreement, then they shall submit such disagreement to the Accounting
Expert for resolution in accordance with the procedures of Section 2.3(d),
mutatis mutandis. Buyer shall timely file all such Member Returns as finally
determined in accordance with this Section 6.9(a); provided, however, that if
the Accounting Expert is unable to resolve any disputed items before the due
date for any Member Return, such Member Return shall be filed as prepared by
the Securityholder Representative and then amended to reflect the Accounting Expert's resolution, if necessary. Any income Tax
deductions in respect of any Group Company arising in connection with the
Option Payment Amount or compensatory items included in Company Transaction
Expenses shall, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, be reflected on the
Tax Returns of the Group Companies for Pre-Closing Tax Periods.

(b) Buyer shall cause the Company, at the Company's sole expense, to cause to
be prepared and filed all Tax Returns, other than the Member Returns, for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period (including a Straddle Period) which are to be filed by
any Group Company after the Closing Date (the "Buyer Returns"). Each such
Buyer Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Group
Companies' past practice and in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, except as otherwise required by Law, at least five (5) days prior
to the due date of any Buyer Returns, the Members, severally (but not jointly)
in accordance with their Securityholder Pro Rata Shares (but jointly and
severally as among the Key Members (up to the sum of the Key Members'
respective Securityholder Pro Rata Shares)), shall timely provide to Buyer the
amount of any Pre-Closing Taxes reflected as due and payable on all such Tax
Returns to the extent that such Pre-Closing Taxes are not reflected as a
liability in the calculation of Closing Working Capital, as finally
determined. Buyer shall deliver to the Securityholder Representative, for
Securityholder Representative's review and comment each Buyer Return with
respect to a Straddle Period (each, a "Straddle Return") at least fifteen (15)
days prior to its due date (or if such Straddle Return is due in fewer than
fifteen (15) days after the Closing Date, then as soon after the Closing Date
as is reasonably practicable). The Securityholder Representative shall provide
written comments on each such Straddle Return within fifteen (15) days of
receipt of such Straddle Return. If the Securityholder Representative notifies
Buyer of any disagreement with such Straddle Return, then the parties shall
attempt to resolve such disagreement through good-faith negotiation and if,
within the ensuing fifteen (15) days, the parties are unable to resolve their
disagreement, then they shall submit such disagreement to the Accounting
Expert for resolution in accordance with the procedures of Section 2.3(d),
mutatis mutandis. Buyer shall timely file all such Straddle Returns as finally
determined in accordance with this Section 6.9(b); provided, however, that if
the Accounting Expert is unable to resolve any disputed items before the due
date for any Straddle Return, such Straddle Return shall be filed as prepared
by the Buyer and then amended to reflect the Accounting Expert's resolution,
if necessary.

(c) None of Buyer, any Group Company, or any Affiliate of Buyer (including,
after the Closing, the Group Companies) shall (i) amend, re-file or otherwise
modify (or grant an extension of any statute of limitation with respect to)
any Tax Return solely relating to the Group Companies with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or (ii) cause or permit any Person to make any Tax election
with respect to any Group Company that has retroactive effect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, without the prior written consent of the Securityholder
Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

(d) Any credits or refunds of Pre-Closing Taxes (to the extent that such
credits or refunds are not reflected as an asset in the calculation of Closing
Working Capital, as finally determined) shall belong to the Securityholders
and be paid to the Securityholder Representative (for further distribution to
the Members in accordance with their respective Additional Pro Rata Shares)
upon actual receipt of such refund in cash or application of such credit
actually to reduce other Taxes due and owing by Buyer, any Group Company or
any of their Affiliates. Any contrary provision of this Section 6.9(d)
notwithstanding, the amount of any refund or credit which is required to be
paid to the Securityholder Representative shall be reduced (i) by the amount
of any Taxes on such refund or credit and any out-of-pocket expenses that
Buyer, any Group Company or any of their respective Affiliates incur (or will
incur) with respect to such refund or credit, and (ii) shall not include any
refund or credit (which shall be for the benefit of Buyer, the Group Companies
or their respective Affiliates) that (A) results from the carryback of any net
operating loss, capital loss or other Tax attribute incurred in any Tax period
(or portion of any Straddle Period) beginning after the Closing Date, or (B)
is included in the computation of Closing Working Capital. In the event any
Tax refund or credit is subsequently disallowed or determined to be an amount
less than the amount taken into account to make a payment pursuant to this
Section 6.9(d) by a Governmental Authority, each of the Securityholders shall
(on joint and several basis as among the Key Members (up to the sum of the Key
Members' respective Securityholder Pro Rata Shares), and on several (and not
joint) basis as to the Members other than the Key Members in accordance with
their respective Securityholder Pro Rata Shares) promptly return its
respective Securityholder Pro Rata Share of such excess to Buyer along with
any applicable interest and penalties. (e) After the Closing Date, Buyer, the Company and the Securityholder
Representative, respectively, shall inform the other party in writing of the
commencement of any claim, audit, investigation, examination, or other
proceeding or self-assessment relating in whole or in part to Pre-Closing
Taxes ("Tax Contest") for which either party may be entitled to indemnity from
the other party under this Agreement; provided, however, that one party's
failure to give such notice shall not relieve the other party of its
indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent such other party is
actually and materially prejudiced thereby. After the Closing Date, Buyer
shall have the exclusive right to represent the interests of the Group
Companies in any and all Tax Contests; provided, however, that, to the extent
that any such Tax Contest could reasonably be expected to result in a Tax
indemnification liability of the Members pursuant to this Agreement or
otherwise materially adversely impact any items that pass through to the
Members, (i) Buyer shall keep the Securityholder Representative reasonably
informed and consult in good faith with the Securityholder Representative and
his Tax advisors with respect to any issue relating to such Tax Contest (and
the Securityholder Representative and his Tax counsel or Tax adviser, at the
Securityholder Representative's expense, will be permitted to attend meetings
with taxing authorities) and (ii) Buyer shall timely provide the
Securityholder Representative with copies of all correspondence, notices and
other written materials received from any taxing authorities and shall
otherwise keep the Securityholder Representative and his Tax advisors advised
of significant developments in such Tax Contest and of significant
communications involving representatives of the taxing authorities. Buyer
shall not agree or consent to compromise or settle any Tax Contest on a basis
that would result in any materially adversely change in items that pass
through to the Members, or a Pre-Closing Tax liability of the Group Companies
or liability of the Members for indemnification unless the Securityholder
Representative consents to such settlement, compromise or concession, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. To the
extent permissible under applicable Law, the Securityholder Representative and
Buyer shall cooperate to ensure that the Company makes an effective election
pursuant to Section 6226(a) of the Code for any applicable Pre-Closing Tax
Period. To the extent of any conflict between this Section 6.9(e) and Section
8.6, this Section 6.9(e) shall govern with respect to any Tax matters.

(f) The parties shall cooperate (and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate) fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
parties, in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant
to this Section 6.9 and any Tax audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes and payments in respect thereof. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other parties' request) the provision of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Buyer and the Company shall retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Group Companies relating
to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration
of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority. Each
of the parties shall furnish the other parties with copies of all relevant
correspondence received from any Governmental Authority in connection with any
Tax audit or information request with respect to any Taxes for which any other
party may have an indemnification obligation under this Agreement. Buyer, the
Members and the Securityholder Representative agree, upon request, to provide
the other party with all information that either party may be required to
report pursuant to Sections 6043 and 6043A of the Code and all Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder.

(g) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
Taxes (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with
consummation of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement ("Transfer
Taxes") shall be borne solely by the Securityholders, when due, and the
Securityholder Representative will, at the Securityholders' sole expense, file
all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Taxes. At least five (5) days prior to the due date of such Tax Returns, the
filing party will notify the non-filing party of its share of the Transfer
Taxes reflected as due and payable therein, and the non-filing party will
timely pay such amount to the filing party. Each of Buyer, the Group
Companies, the Securityholder Representative and the Members will reasonably
cooperate with each other to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any such Transfer Taxes.

(h) Buyer and the Members acknowledge and agree that, pursuant to Revenue
Ruling 99-6, the purchase and sale of the Units constitutes, for federal and
applicable state income Tax purposes, (i) with respect to Buyer, a purchase of the assets of the Company and assumption of the
liabilities of the Company and (ii) with respect to the Members, the sale of
Units of the Company. Buyer shall prepare an allocation of the Purchase Price
as finally determined pursuant to this Agreement (and all other items required
under the Code) in accordance with Sections 755 and 1060 of the Code. Buyer
shall deliver a schedule setting forth such allocation within ninety days (90)
days after the Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to this
Agreement. The Securityholder Representative shall timely and properly
prepare, execute, file and deliver all such documents, forms and other
information as Buyer may reasonably request to prepare such allocation. If,
within ten (10) days after receiving Buyer's allocation, the Securityholder
Representative notifies Buyer that Securityholder's Representative disputes
any item(s) reflected thereon, Buyer and the Securityholder's Representative
shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any dispute. If the parties fail to
reach an agreement within thirty (30) days after the Securityholder
Representative notifies Buyer that the Securityholder Representative disputes
any item(s) reflected on Buyer's allocation, then the parties shall have no
further obligations pursuant to this Section 6.9(h), and each of the Buyer and
the Members shall make its own determination of the allocation of the Purchase
Price. The Securityholder Representative, Buyer, the Company and their
respective Affiliates shall (i) be bound by any agreed allocation, as finally
determined under this Section 6.9(h), for purposes of determining any Tax
liabilities, (ii) prepare and file their Tax Returns consistent with such
allocation and (iii) take no position inconsistent with such allocation on any
applicable Tax Return, in any proceeding before any Governmental Authority or
otherwise.

Section 6.10. Further Assurances. Each of the parties shall execute and
deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances and
take such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the
provisions hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.11. Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Exculpation.

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification (and related rights to
contribution, exculpation and expense advancement) as provided in a Group
Company's Organizational Documents or in the agreements set forth on Schedule
6.11 or as provided under Law for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Closing which may exist in favor of the current or former directors, managers
or officers (or persons holding similar positions) of such Group Company
(collectively, the "Covered Persons") shall survive the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms for a period of not less than six (6) years from the Closing.
Without limiting the foregoing, for a period of not less than six (6) years
from the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any Group Company to,
except in accordance with Section 6.11(b), amend, modify or terminate any
Organizational Document regarding or related to such indemnification,
contribution, exculpation or expense advancement matters in a manner that
would be materially adverse to the Covered Persons with respect to pre-Closing
periods.

(b) If Buyer or its successors or assigns: (i) shall consolidate with or
merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and
in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Buyer shall assume all of the obligations of Buyer set forth in
this Section 6.11.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.11, no Covered
Person that is a party to this Agreement shall be entitled to seek or obtain
indemnification, advancement of expenses or exculpation pursuant to any
Organizational Document of any Group Company or indemnification agreement with
any Group Company, and no Group Company shall be required to provide any
indemnification, advancement of expenses or exculpation to any Covered Person
that is a party to this Agreement pursuant to any Organizational Document of
such Group Company or indemnification agreement with any Covered Person, in
connection with any claim for indemnification properly brought by any Buyer
Indemnified Person pursuant to Article 8.

Section 6.12. Notification of Certain Matters. In the event that Buyer, on the
one hand, or the Company, the Securityholder Representative and/or Members, on
the other, become aware on or prior to the Closing Date of any inaccuracy in
or breach of any of their respective representations or warranties, such party
shall promptly notify the other in writing thereof. Section 6.13. Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Without limiting any
other provisions of this Agreement, prior to the Closing, the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to coordinate with Buyer Parent and to
provide the internal resources required to establish: (a) a system of
"internal controls over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances: (i) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP; (ii) that
transactions are executed only in accordance with the authorization of
management; and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of the
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the properties or assets of
the Group Company, and (b) a system of "disclosure controls and procedures"
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act)
sufficient to ensure that all material information concerning the Group
Companies is made known on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for
the preparation of the Company's financial statements; provided that the
Company shall not be required to incur any out of pocket expenses (other than
nominal expenses) in connection with such efforts. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer with respect to integration
planning in respect of accounting and financial reporting functions.

Section 6.14. Financial Reporting Cooperation. During the period between the
signing of this Agreement and the earlier of the Closing or termination of
this Agreement, the Company shall provide, and shall cause Wizard Enterprises
to provide, such reasonable and customary cooperation (and to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its and their respective managers, officers,

authorized representatives to provide such reasonable and customary
cooperation) in connection with Buyer Parent's reporting obligations under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act including using commercially reasonable

401(k) Plan"), such plan termination to be effective no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, but contingent on the Closing. At
least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide Buyer or its legal counsel with a copy of the resolutions authorizing
the Company 401(k) Plan termination for review and approval prior to their
adoption, with such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

Section 6.16. Employees. (a) As of the Closing Date, and for a period of at least twelve (12) months
thereafter, Buyer will provide, or cause one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
(including the Company) to provide, each Employee with (i) a base salary or an
hourly wage rate that is not less than that provided to such Employee by the
Group Companies immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) bonus and incentive
compensation opportunities that are not less favorable than those provided to
such Employee by the Group Companies immediately prior to the Closing, and
(iii) employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
Buyer's similarly situated employees. Buyer and its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates will recognize, for purposes of PTO taken in the first sixty (60)
days of employment with Buyer and for eligibility and vesting purposes under
the Buyer 401(k) Plan, all prior service of the Employees with the Group
Companies as service with Buyer and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates; provided,
however, that no such service credit will be recognized to the extent that it
would result in a duplication of benefits. For purposes of clarity, nothing in
this Section 6.16 shall restrict Buyer's ability to terminate Employees at any
time after the Closing.

(b) As soon as practicable after the Closing, Buyer shall designate, or shall
cause one of Buyer's other Subsidiaries or Affiliates to designate, a defined
contribution plan that includes a cash or deferred arrangement and that
satisfies the requirement of Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code (the
"Buyer 401(k) Plan") in which the Employees will be allowed to participate.
Each Employee who was eligible to participate in the Company 401(k) Plan
immediately prior to the termination of such plan shall become eligible to
participate in the Buyer 401(k) Plan as soon as practicable after the Closing
Date. Buyer shall cause the Buyer 401(k) Plan to accept "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from the
Company 401(k) Plan on behalf of Employees that elect such eligible rollover
distributions into the Buyer 401(k) Plan and who remain employed by Buyer, any
Group Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates at the
time of such rollover.

(c) Nothing in this Section 6.16 (i) is intended to, or will be construed to,
confer upon any Employee or any other Person other than the parties to this
Agreement any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to continued
employment; or (ii) will establish, amend or be deemed to establish or amend
any Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement of
Buyer or any Group Company or will limit the rights of Buyer or any Group
Company to establish, amend or terminate any Benefit Plan or any other benefit
plan, program, policy or arrangement, whether before or after Closing.

Section 6.17. Discretionary Cash Bonus Plan. At the Closing, the Company shall
establish a discretionary cash bonus plan (the "Discretionary Cash Bonus
Plan") for employees of the Company with respect to each of the First Earnout
Period, the Second Earnout Period and the Third Earnout Period that provides
for eligible employees who participate an annual cash bonus payment up to Two
Million Dollars ($2,000,000) for each Earnout Period. The Discretionary Cash
Bonus Plan shall be in form reasonably acceptable to Buyer and the
Securityholder Representative and shall provide for performance metrics
substantially similar to those set forth in Section 2.5 (including the Base
Plan and the Base Plan Schedule). Under the Discretionary Cash Bonus Plan,
with respect to each Earnout Period, a minimum amount of Four Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($400,000) would become payable, subject to continued employment, with
up to an additional One Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,600,000) (the
"Conditional Portion") payable subject to achievement of the performance
targets set forth therein. The Company's then-current President shall have the
right to select the Company employees who may receive the awards under the
Discretionary Cash Bonus Plan and to allocate the award amounts among such
employees; provided, that such recipients may not include the Key Members or
their Affiliates or principals.

any Group Company or EIP; (ii) any right based on such Person's capacity as a
claimed holder of equity or equity-linked securities (including the Options),

(viii) the matters set forth on Schedule 8.2.

(b) Subject to the terms of this Article 8, from and after the Closing, each
Key Member, on a joint and several basis (up to the sum of the Key Members'
aggregate Securityholder Pro Rata Shares), and each other Securityholder, on a
several and not joint basis, indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons and hold
them harmless from and against any and all Losses incurred or suffered by a
Buyer Indemnified Person resulting from or arising out of:

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by such
Securityholder in this Agreement, in any Option Cancellation Agreement or any
certificate delivered by the Securityholders at the Closing pursuant hereto
(other than a Fundamental Representation); (ii) any breach or inaccuracy of any Fundamental Representation made by such
Securityholder in this Agreement or in any Option Cancellation Agreement; and

(iii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of such Securityholder contained

their respective managers, officers, trustees, beneficiaries, employees,
successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Securityholder

Losses incurred or suffered by a Securityholder Indemnified Person resulting
from or arising out of:

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by Buyer

Section 8.4. Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) The Securityholders shall have no liability pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i)
or Section 8.2(b)(i) with respect to Losses except to the extent that the
aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds an amount equal to $3,000,000 (the
"Basket"); provided, that, in the event the Basket is exceeded, all of the
applicable Losses from the first Dollar shall, subject to the other terms and
conditions hereof, be recoverable; and; provided, further, that this Section
8.4(a) shall not apply to any breach of any representation and warranty based
on Fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact (but not
negligent misrepresentation).

(b) The Securityholders shall have no liability pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i)
or Section 8.2(b)(i) with respect to Losses in excess of the Indemnity Escrow
Amount, and the Indemnity Escrow Amount fund and Earnout setoffs contemplated
in Section 8.8 shall be the sole sources of recovery by a Buyer Indemnified
Person in respect of such Losses (and in the priorities contemplated in
Section 8.8); provided, that this Section 8.4(b) shall not apply to any breach
of any representation and warranty based on Fraud or intentional
misrepresentation of a material fact (but not negligent misrepresentation).

(c) The Securityholders shall have no liability pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i)
or Section 8.2(b)(i) for Losses in respect of any individual claim unless such
Losses arising from such individual claim exceed $15,000; provided, that this
Section 8.4(c) shall not apply to any breach of any representation and
warranty based on Fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact
(but not negligent misrepresentation).

(d) Other than with respect to Fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a
material fact (but not negligent misrepresentation), (i) no Securityholder
(other than Key Members) shall have any liability pursuant to Article 8 in an
aggregate amount greater than the portion of the Purchase Price such
Securityholder actually receives and (ii) no Key Member shall have any
liability pursuant to Article 8 in an aggregate amount greater than the
aggregate portion of the Purchase Price actually received by all Key Members.

(e) Other than with respect to Fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a
material fact (but not negligent misrepresentation), Buyer shall have no
liability pursuant to Article 8 in excess of the Purchase Price.

(f) The Securityholders shall have no liability pursuant to Section 8.2 with
respect to a Loss to the extent such Loss relates to any item included on, or
is a liability reserved or accrued for (whether in whole or in part) in, the Closing Statement or that is otherwise taken into account in the
calculation of any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Article 2.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer Indemnified Persons will not be
entitled to recover any Losses relating to any matter arising under, or any
facts and circumstances relating to or arising out of, a provision of this
Agreement to the extent that the Buyer Indemnified Persons (i) have already
recovered Losses with respect to such matter pursuant to another provision of
this Agreement or (ii) have already recovered the Losses with respect to such
matter from another Securityholder.

(g) If a state of facts exists that would allow a Buyer Indemnified Person to
seek recovery under both Section 8.2(a)(i) (with respect to any breach of a
representation or warranty of the Company other than any Fundamental
representation) and Section 8.2(a)(iii) (solely with respect to failure of the
Company to notify Buyer of such breach pursuant to Section 6.12) or Section
8.2(b)(i) (with respect to any breach of a representation or warranty of a
Securityholder other than any Fundamental representation) and Section
8.2(b)(iii) (solely with respect to failure of the Securityholder
Representative or Member to notify Buyer of such breach pursuant to Section
6.12), then such Buyer Indemnified Person may only seek recovery for Losses
under Section 8.2(a)(i) or Section 8.2(b)(i), as applicable. For the avoidance
of doubt, the foregoing shall not prohibit any Buyer Indemnified Person from
seeking recovery under Section 8.2(a)(iii) or Section 8.2(b)(iii) for breach
of any covenant other than Section 6.12 in respect of such state of facts.

(h) If a state of facts exists that would allow a Securityholder Indemnified
Person to seek recovery under both Section 8.3(a) (with respect to any breach
of a representation or warranty of Buyer other than any Fundamental
representation) and Section 8.3(c) (solely with respect to failure of Buyer to
notify the Company, the Securityholder Representative and the Members of such
breach pursuant to Section 6.12), then such Securityholder Indemnified Person
may only seek recovery for Losses under Section 8.3(a). For the avoidance of
doubt, the foregoing shall not prohibit any Securityholder Indemnified Person
from seeking recovery under Section 8.3(c) for breach of any covenant other
than Section 6.12 in respect of such state of facts.

Section 8.5. Other Provisions.

(a) For all purposes of this Article 8, "Losses" shall be net of any amounts
actually paid to an Indemnified Person under any insurance policy or Contract
in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification
hereunder, and each Indemnified Person shall use its reasonable commercial
efforts, consistent with then existing practices, to recover all amounts
payable from an insurer or other third party under any such insurance policy
or Contract prior to seeking indemnification hereunder; provided, however,
that the amount deemed to be paid under such insurance policies shall be net
of the deductible and resulting premium increases for such policies.

(b) If the amount to be netted hereunder from any indemnification payment
required hereunder is determined after payment by an Indemnifying Person to an
Indemnified Person of any amount otherwise required to be paid as
indemnification pursuant hereto, the Indemnified Person shall repay, promptly
(but in any event within thirty (30) calendar days) after such determination,
any amount that the Indemnifying Person would not have had to pay pursuant
hereto had such determination been made at the time of such payment.

(c) Notwithstanding the fact that any Indemnified Person may have the right to
assert claims for indemnification under or in respect of more than one
provision of this Agreement in respect of any fact, event, condition or
circumstance, no Indemnified Person shall be entitled to recover the amount of
any Loss suffered by such Indemnified Person more than once, regardless of
whether such Loss may be as a result of a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, obligation or covenant or otherwise. In addition,
any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
liability, or a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, as applicable.

(d) For the purpose of determining whether a breach of any representation or
warranty has occurred and the amount of damages resulting therefrom, any
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other similar qualification with
respect to materiality contained in or otherwise applicable to such
representation or warranty (excluding Section 4.10(a) and 6.3(b)(xix)) shall
be disregarded. (e) For the purpose of this Article 8, in each case where a decision or
agreement to be made by the Indemnified Person or the Indemnifying Person is,
collectively, to be made by the Securityholders, then in each such case all
references to such Indemnified Person or Indemnifying Person, as the case may
be, in this Article 8 (except for provisions relating to an obligation to make
or a right to receive any payments) shall be deemed to refer to the
Securityholder Representative acting on behalf of such Indemnified Person or
Indemnifying Person, as applicable.

Section 8.6. Third-Party Claim Indemnification Procedures.

(a) In the event that any written claim or demand for which a party (in such
capacity, an "Indemnifying Person") may have liability to any Indemnified
Person hereunder, other than those relating to Taxes (which are the subject of
Section 6.9), is asserted against or sought to be collected from any
Indemnified Person by a third party (a "Third-Party Claim"), such Indemnified
Person shall promptly (but in any event within ten (10) days) following such
Indemnified Person's receipt of a Third-Party Claim, notify the Indemnifying
Person in writing of such Third-Party Claim, the amount or the estimated
amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent then ascertainable, any
other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating
thereto, and a reasonably detailed explanation of the events giving rise to
such Third-Party Claim and any other material details pertaining thereto (a
"Claim Notice"); provided, however, that the failure to timely give a Claim
Notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations hereunder,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Person shall have been actually and
materially prejudiced by such failure or as provided in Section 8.1.
Thereafter, the Indemnified Person shall deliver to the Indemnifying Person,
promptly following the Indemnified Person's receipt thereof, copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Person relating to the Third-Party Claim.

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Person notifies the Indemnified Person
that it elects to defend the Indemnified Person against a Third-Party Claim
within thirty (30) days following the receipt of notice from the Indemnified
Person of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have the right to
defend the Third-Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnifiable
hereunder by appropriate proceedings and with counsel reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnified Person and shall have the power to direct and control such
defense at its expense, subject to the Indemnifying Person's (x) acknowledging
its indemnity obligation hereunder and undertaking to indemnify and hold the
Indemnified Person harmless from, against and in respect of, and to pay to
such Indemnified Person the full amount of any Losses arising out of, relating
to or resulting therefrom, and (y) providing the Indemnified Person with
evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Person that the Indemnifying
Person will have the financial resources to defend against such Third-Party
Claim and to fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Person shall not have the
right to assume the conduct and control of such defense if the Third-Party
Claim which the Indemnifying Person seeks to assume control (i) seeks monetary
relief in excess of the purchase price actually paid hereunder or any non-
monetary relief (including an injunction or other equitable relief), (ii) is
reasonably likely to result in Losses which will exceed the amount such
Indemnified Person will be entitled to recover as a result of the limitations
set forth in this Article 8, (iii) involves criminal allegations, (iv)
involves a claim that, in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified Person,
the Indemnifying Person failed or is failing to reasonably prosecute or
defend, (v) relates to Taxes, (vi) involves a claim by a Governmental
Authority or (vii) relates to Buyer Parent's (or any of its Affiliate's)
financial statements or Buyer Parent's reporting obligations under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, including any derivative Action by the
shareholders of Buyer Parent. Once the Indemnifying Person has made such
election, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to participate in (but
not control) any such defense and to employ separate counsel of its choosing;
provided, however, that such separate counsel at the Indemnified Person's own
expense (unless based on the advice of counsel to the applicable Indemnified
Person, a material legal conflict exists between the applicable Indemnified
Person and the Indemnifying Person that would make such separate
representation necessary, in which case the Indemnifying Person will bear such
expense, subject to the limitations set forth herein). If the Indemnifying
Person does not (or is not permitted to) elect to conduct or control the
defense of any Third-Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnifiable
hereunder, the applicable Indemnified Person may conduct and control the
defense of such Third-Party Claim; provided, that the Indemnified Person shall
not settle, offer to settle or compromise such Third-Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Person (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

(c) If the Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall not, without the prior written consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, it being understood that withholding, delaying and/or conditioning consent to
any settlement or compromise that involves anything other than payment of
monetary damages shall be deemed to be reasonable per se) of the Indemnified
Person, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third-Party
Claim; provided, that, if the Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of a
Third-Party Claim and is in good faith contesting such Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Person's consent is not required for any settlement, compromise or
discharge of a Third-Party Claim that the Indemnifying Person may reasonably
recommend and that by its terms (i) obligates the Indemnifying Person to pay
the full amount of Losses in connection with such Third-Party Claim, (ii) does
not require any payment or other action by any Indemnified Person or the
admission of any wrongdoing or misconduct by any Indemnified Person, and (iii)
fully and irrevocably releases all Indemnified Persons in connection with such
Third-Party Claim and does not impose any injunctive or other equitable relief
against any Indemnified Person or its Affiliate.

(d) The Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person shall reasonably
cooperate in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party
Claim, including by providing reasonable access to each other's relevant books
and records, and appropriate personnel. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the Indemnifying Person's request and sole expense) the
provision to the Indemnifying Person of books and records and information that
are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and appropriate personnel
available on a mutually convenient basis during normal business hours to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. The Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person shall use
reasonable commercial efforts to avoid production of confidential information
(consistent with applicable Law), and to cooperate with the other party to
minimize the extent of such disclosure and to cause all communications among
employees, counsel and others representing any party to a Third-Party Claim to
be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product
privileges (which may include redacting or withholding information as
reasonably appropriate).

Section 8.7. Direct Claim Indemnification Procedures. Each Indemnified Person
shall assert any claim on account of any Losses which do not result from a
Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") by giving the Indemnifying Person written
notice thereof reasonably promptly (and, in any event, no later than thirty
(30) days following the Indemnified Person's discovery of the applicable
Losses reasonably likely to give rise to a claim under this Article 8). Such
notice by the Indemnified Person shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable
detail, include copies of all available material written evidence thereof and
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of Losses that have
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Person; provided, however, that
the failure to timely give such notice shall not affect the rights of an
Indemnified Person hereunder: (a) unless such failure has a material
prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available to the
Indemnifying Person with respect to such Direct Claim or on the Indemnifying
Person's ability to mitigate such Direct Claim, or (b) unless the
indemnification obligations are materially increased as a result of such
failure.

Section 8.8. Indemnification Payment Priority. Except with respect to claims
for Fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact (but not
negligent misrepresentation), the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall seek
reimbursement for such Loss: (a) first, as a setoff against any Earnout
payment that is payable but not yet paid, (b) second, from the Indemnity
Escrow Amount, and once the Indemnity Escrow Amount is exhausted, and (c)
third, from the Securityholders, on joint and several basis as among the Key
Members (up to the sum of the Key Members' respective Securityholder Pro Rata
Shares), on the one hand, and on several (and not joint) basis as to the
Securityholders other than the Key Members in accordance with their respective
Securityholder Pro Rata Share, on the other.

Section 8.9. Characterization of Indemnification Payments. All payments made
(or deemed to be made, in accordance with this Agreement) by any Indemnifying
Person to an Indemnified Person with respect to any claim pursuant to Section
8.2 or Section 8.3 shall be treated, to the fullest extent possible under
applicable Law, as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

Section 8.10. Investigation by Indemnifying Parties. In connection with any
claim pursuant to this Article 8:

(a)The Indemnified Person shall allow the Indemnifying Person and its
financial, accounting or legal advisers to reasonably investigate the fact,
matter or circumstance alleged to (or which may) give rise to such claim and
whether and to what extent any amount is or may be payable in respect of such
claim. (b) The Indemnified Persons shall, and shall cause their controlled Affiliates
and all of their respective Representatives to, provide such information and
assistance as the Indemnifying Person or its financial, accounting or legal
advisers shall reasonably request in connection with the investigation
referenced in clause (a), including:

(i) upon reasonable advance notice, reasonable access during normal business
hours to premises and personnel (including any relevant employee) with
knowledge relating to the relevant facts, matters or circumstances or who can
otherwise reasonably assist the Indemnifying Person; and

(ii) the right to examine and copy or photograph any relevant assets,
accounts, correspondence, documents and records,

in each case, subject to customary confidentiality and expense reimbursement
undertaking by the Indemnifying Person and its financial, accounting and legal
advisors. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, failure by the
Indemnified Person (or its controlled Affiliates or Representatives) to comply
with this Section 8.10 shall not prejudice or otherwise affect the Indemnified
Person's right to indemnification pursuant to this Article 8, other than such
Indemnified Person's willful breach of this Section 8.10.

Section 8.11. Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, except as provided in Section 2.3 (Post-Closing Determination), for
the right of any party to seek specific performance or with respect to Fraud
or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact (but not negligent
misrepresentation), from and after the Closing the rights and remedies of
Buyer, any Group Company and the Securityholders, and any Buyer Indemnified
Person and any Securityholder Indemnified Person (each Buyer Indemnified
Person and Securityholder Indemnified Person is referred to herein as an
"Indemnified Person"), under this Article 8 are exclusive and in lieu of any
and all other rights and remedies which Buyer, any Group Company or any
Securityholder, or any Indemnified Person, may have under this Agreement or
any Transaction Document or otherwise against each other with respect to this
Agreement or any Transaction Document and with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, and each party expressly waives and releases
and agrees to waive and release any and all other rights or causes of action
it or its Affiliates may have against the other party or its Affiliates now or
in the future under any Law (regardless of the theory of recourse) with
respect to the preceding matters.

ARTICLE 9

satisfaction of or result in the failure of any condition to the obligations
of Buyer at the Closing and such violation or breach has not been waived by

of: (i) thirty (30) days after receipt by the Company, the Securityholder
Representative or Member, as applicable, of written notice of such breach from
Buyer and (ii) the Outside Date; provided, however, that Buyer may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(c) at any time during
which Buyer is in material breach of this Agreement or any Transaction
Document; or (d) by the Company, if there has been a material violation or breach by Buyer
of any representation or warranty (or any such representation or warranty

condition to the obligations of the Members at the Closing and such violation
or breach has not been waived by the Securityholder Representative or, with
respect to a breach of any covenant or agreement under this Agreement that is

representatives or employees or their heirs, successors and permitted assigns,
except for the obligations of the parties contained in Section 6.4 (Public
Disclosure; Confidentiality), this Section 9.2 and Article 10 (Miscellaneous)
(and any related definitional provisions set forth herein), and except that
nothing in this Section 9.2 shall relieve either party from liability for
Fraud or any willful breach of this Agreement that arose prior to such
termination.

ARTICLE 10

Peyree to serve as the sole and exclusive representative of the
Securityholders (the "Securityholder Representative") with respect to those
provisions of this Agreement that contemplate action by the Securityholder
Representative and with respect to the Escrow Agreement; provided, however,
that if Scott Peyree at any time is unable, due to incapacity or otherwise, to
serve as Securityholder Representative or resigns as Securityholder
Representative, then successive Securityholder Representatives shall be chosen
by Securityholders holding a majority of Units outstanding immediately prior
to the Closing (including Units issuable upon exercise of Options outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Closing). Each successor Securityholder
Representative, if required to serve, shall sign an acknowledgment in writing
agreeing to perform and be bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement
applicable to the Securityholder Representative. Each successor Securityholder
Representative shall have all of the power, authority, rights and privileges
conferred by this Agreement upon the original Securityholder Representative,
and the term "Securityholder Representative" as used herein shall be deemed to
include any successor Securityholder Representative.

(b) The Securityholder Representative is hereby constituted and appointed as
agent and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of the other Securityholders with
respect to the performance of his or her duties as the Securityholder
Representative. This power of attorney and all authority hereby conferred is
granted and shall be irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of any
Securityholder, by operation of Law, whether by such Securityholder's death,
disability, protective supervision or any other event. The Securityholder
Representative shall promptly deliver to each Securityholder any notice
received by the Securityholder Representative concerning this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Securityholder
Representative has full power and authority, on behalf of each Securityholder
and such Securityholder's successors and assigns, to: (i) interpret the terms
and provisions of this Agreement and the documents to be executed and
delivered by the Securityholders in connection herewith, including the Escrow
Agreement, (ii) execute and deliver and receive deliveries of all agreements,
certificates, statements, notices, approvals, extensions, waivers,
undertakings, amendments, and other documents required or permitted to be
given in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, (iii) receive service of process in
connection with any claims under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, (iv)
agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, assume the
defense of claims, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take all actions
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Securityholder Representative
for the accomplishment of the foregoing, (v) give and receive notices and
communications, (vi) authorize delivery to Buyer of (A) the Adjustment Escrow Amount or any portion thereof if the Net Adjustment Amount as finally
determined in accordance with Section 2.3 is negative and (B) the Indemnity
Escrow Amount or any portion thereof in satisfaction of claims brought by
Buyer for Losses, (vii) object to such deliveries, (viii) distribute the
Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Indemnity Escrow Amount and any earnings and
proceeds thereon, (ix) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises regarding the Earnout Statements and Earnout payments with respect
to any Earnout period, and (x) take all actions necessary or appropriate in
the judgment of the Securityholder Representative on behalf of the
Securityholders in connection with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(c) Service by the Securityholder Representative shall be without compensation
except for reimbursement out of the Representative Expense Fund and the
reimbursement by the Securityholders of out-of-pocket expenses and
indemnification, in each case as specifically provided herein.

(d) The Securityholder Representative shall have no duties or responsibilities
except those expressly set forth herein, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities on behalf of any
Securityholder shall otherwise exist against the Securityholder
Representative. The Securityholder Representative shall not be liable to any
Securityholder relating to the performance of the Securityholder
Representative's duties under this Agreement for any errors in judgment,
negligence, oversight, breach of duty or otherwise except to the extent it is
finally determined in a court of competent jurisdiction by clear and
convincing evidence that the actions taken or not taken by the Securityholder
Representative constituted Fraud or were taken or not taken in bad faith. The
Securityholder Representative shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Securityholders against all liabilities, claims, Losses, fees, fines costs
amounts paid in settlement, judgments or expenses (including fees,
disbursements and costs of counsel and other skilled professionals and in
connection with seeking recovery from insurers), that the Securityholder
Representative may suffer or incur in connection with any action or omission
of the Securityholder Representative (collectively, "Representative Expenses")
; provided, however, that the Securityholder Representative shall not be
entitled to indemnification hereunder to the extent it is finally determined
in a court of competent jurisdiction by clear and convincing evidence that the
actions taken or not taken by the Securityholder Representative constituted
Fraud or were taken or not taken in bad faith. The Securityholder
Representative shall be protected in acting upon any notice, statement or
certificate believed by the Securityholder Representative to be genuine and to
have been furnished by the appropriate Person and in acting or refusing to act
in good faith on any matter. Any such Representative Expenses may be
recovered, first, from the Representative Expense Fund, second, from funds to
be released from the Indemnity Escrow Amount and otherwise distributable to
the Securityholders at the time of distribution, and third, directly from the
Securityholders.

(e) Buyer shall be entitled to conclusively rely in good faith upon any
actions taken by the Securityholder Representative as the duly authorized
action of the Securityholder Representative on behalf of each Securityholder
with respect to any matters set forth in this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement.

(f) The Representative Expense Amount will be deposited by Buyer in the
Representative Expense Fund in accordance with Section 1.6(c). The
Representative Expense Fund shall be held by the Securityholder Representative
as agent and for the benefit of the Securityholders in a segregated client
account and shall be used for the purpose of paying directly, or reimbursing
the Securityholder Representative for, any Representative Expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. The
Securityholder Representative may contribute funds to the Representative
Expense Fund from any consideration otherwise distributable to the
Securityholders. The Securityholder Representative is not providing any
investment supervision, recommendations or advice and shall have no
responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the Representative
Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Securityholder Representative is not acting as a withholding
agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the Representative Expense
Fund, and has no tax reporting or income distribution obligations. The
Securityholders will not receive any interest on the Representative Expense
Fund and assign to the Securityholder Representative any such interest. As
soon as reasonably determined by the Securityholder Representative that the
Representative Expense Fund is no longer required to be withheld, and in any
event not later than the later of (i) the date on which all funds are released
from the Indemnity Escrow Amount fund and (ii) the final determination of any
amounts payable in respect of the Earnout, the Securityholder Representative
shall distribute the then-remaining amount of the Representative Expense Fund,
if any, to the Securityholders based on their respective Additional Pro Rata
Share; provided that amounts payable in respect of any Optionholder may be delivered to the Company for payment through a designated payroll account,
subject to all applicable withholdings therefrom as required by Law.

communications hereunder shall be deemed effective or to have been duly given

Section 10.3. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including all Schedules and
Exhibits hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement and the Transaction Documents
contain the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof, and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters.

Section 10.4. Amendment; Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, (a) in the case of an amendment before Closing, by Buyer and the
Company, (b) in the case of an amendment after Closing, by Buyer and the
Securityholder Representative, or (c) in the case of a waiver, by the party
against whom such waiver is intended to be effective. No failure or delay by
any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
power or privilege.

Section 10.5. No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective
successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no party may assign (including by gift) any of its rights (other
than, in the case of the Members, assignments of rights to payment for bona
fide estate planning purposes to any Person other than an employee of the
Group Companies) or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of Buyer and the Securityholder
Representative and any purported assignment in violation of the foregoing
shall be null and void ab initio; provided that Buyer may assign any of its
rights or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any Affiliate of
Buyer, with the understanding that no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of
its obligations hereunder. Except as expressly set forth herein in Section 6.7
or Article 8, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any Person other than Buyer, the Company, the Securityholders and
the Securityholder Representative, and their respective successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns, any rights, benefits or remedies under
or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 10.6. Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the party incurring
such costs and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary herein (a) all filing fees to be paid in connection with the HSR Act
shall be paid one-half (1/2) by Buyer, on the one hand, and one-half (1/2) by
the Company (as a Company Transaction Expense), and (b) all fees and expenses
relating to the Escrow Agent shall be paid one-half (1/2) by Buyer, on the one
hand, and one-half (1/2) by the Securityholders (as a Company Transaction
Expense), on the other.

Section 10.7. Disclosure Schedule.

(a) The "Disclosure Schedule" means that certain document (as may be modified
from time to time in accordance with the terms hereof) identified as the
Disclosure Schedule, dated as of the date hereof, delivered by the Company to
Buyer in connection with this Agreement. Each Section in the Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to qualify the corresponding Section of this
Agreement and any other Section of this Agreement to which the application of
such disclosure is readily apparent on its face. It is specifically
acknowledged that the Disclosure Schedule may expressly provide exceptions to
a particular Section of Articles 3 and 4 notwithstanding that the Section does
not include a schedule reference.

(b) Neither the specification of any Dollar amount in any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
the Disclosure Schedule is intended to vary the definition of Material Adverse
Effect or to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item
so included or other items, are or are not material, and no party shall use
the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such
item in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the Disclosure
Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Unless this
Agreement specifically provides otherwise, neither the specification of any
item or matter in any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Disclosure Schedule is intended
to imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not
in the ordinary course of business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting forth or the inclusion of any such item or matter in
any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation,
item or matter not described herein or included in the Disclosure Schedule is
or is not in the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement.
Nothing contained in the Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as an
admission of liability or responsibility of the Company or any other party to
any third party.

(c) Each Section of the Disclosure Schedule is qualified in its entirety by
reference to specific provisions of this Agreement and does not constitute,
and shall not be construed as constituting, representations, warranties or
covenants of any party, except as and to the extent provided in this
Agreement. Certain matters set forth in the Disclosure Schedule are included
for informational purposes only notwithstanding that, because they do not rise
above applicable materiality thresholds or otherwise, they may not be required
by the terms of this Agreement to be set forth herein.

(d) The Company may, from time to time prior to the Closing, by notice to
Buyer at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, supplement, amend
or create any Schedule of the Disclosure Schedule, solely in order to add
information with respect to events occurring after the date hereof. No such
supplement, amendment or addition shall be evidence, in and of itself, that
the representations and warranties in the corresponding Schedule are no longer
true and correct in all material respects. It is specifically agreed that the
Disclosure Schedule may be supplemented, amended and/or added to, to add
immaterial, as well as material, items thereto (such supplement, amendment or
addition, a "Schedule Supplement"). No such Schedule Supplement shall be
deemed to cure any breach for purposes of Section 7.2(a) (including, without
limitation for purposes of the application of Section 9.1(c)), and no Schedule
Supplement shall affect Buyer's rights to terminate the Agreement in
accordance with Article 9, provided that if the Closing occurs, then each such
Schedule Supplement shall be deemed to be incorporated into and to supplement
and amend the Disclosure Schedules for the purpose of Section 8.2(a)(i),
Section 8.2(a)(ii), Section 8.2(b)(i) and Section 8.2(b)(ii).

Section 10.8. Governing Law; Arbitration; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver
of Jury Trial.

(a) The internal Laws of the State of Delaware, irrespective of its conflict
of laws principles, will govern the validity of this Agreement.

(b) Subject to the requirements of clause (c), each of the parties hereto: (i)
submits to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting or having
jurisdiction in Dover County, State of Delaware in any Action arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, (ii) agrees that all claims in respect of the
Action shall be heard and determined in any such court, and (iii) agrees not
to bring any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other
court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of any Action so brought and waives any bond, surety or other
security that might be required of any other party with respect thereto. Any
party may make service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of the
process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner provided
for giving of notices in Section 10.2. Nothing in this Section 10.8, however,
will affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by law.

(c) Any Action or arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
resolved by binding arbitration held in Dover County, State of Delaware under
the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and
Mediation Services/EnDispute (or its successor), except to the extent that
such rules are inconsistent with this Section 10.8(c), in which case this
Section 10.8(c) will govern. Except as may be otherwise expressly provided
herein, for any matter submitted to arbitration, the burden of proof will be
as it would be if the claim were litigated in a judicial proceeding governed
exclusively by the internal Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed, entered into and performed within the State of Delaware,
without regard to the principles of choice of law or conflicts of law of any
jurisdiction. The arbitrator to any such arbitration hearing shall determine,
in its sole discretion, which party(ies) are the non-prevailing party(ies).
Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction.

(d) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF THE
PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
HEREOF.

Section 10.9. Interpretation.

(a) The Article and Section headings contained in this Agreement are solely
for the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the parties and
shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

(b) Unless the express context otherwise requires: (i) the words "hereof,"
"herein," and "hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in this
Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement; (ii) any reference to the masculine, feminine or
neuter gender shall include all genders, the plural shall include the
singular, and the singular shall include the plural; (iii) references herein
to a specific Article, Section, Subsection or Schedule shall refer,

Agreement; (iv) wherever the word "include," "includes," or "including" is
used in this Agreement, it shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation;" (v) the word "or" shall be inclusive and not exclusive
(for example, the phrase "A or B" means "A or B or both," not "either A or B
but not both"), unless used in conjunction with "either" or the like; (vi)
each reference to any Contract shall be to such Contract as amended,
supplemented, waived or otherwise modified from time to time; (vii) each
reference to a Law, statute, regulation or other government rule is to it as
amended from time to time and, as applicable, is to corresponding provisions
of successor Laws, statutes, regulations or other government rules; and (viii)
each reference to a "party" means a party to this Agreement, including by the
execution of a joinder.

(c) Any deadline or time period set forth in this Agreement that by its terms
ends on a day that is not a Business Day shall be automatically extended to
the next succeeding Business Day.

(d) With regard to each and every term and condition of this Agreement, the
parties understand and agree that the same have or has been mutually
negotiated, prepared and drafted, and that if at any time the parties desire
or are required to interpret or construe any such term or condition or any
agreement or instrument subject thereto, no consideration shall be given to
the issue of which party actually prepared, drafted or requested any term or
condition of this Agreement.

(e) The terms "made available" and "provided to" when used in reference to the
Company having made or making items or information available to, or to having
provided information to, Buyer or any of its Representatives, means that such
items or information were made available by the Company or its Representatives
via: (i) the posting of such items or information to the electronic data site
maintained by Donnelley Financial Solutions Venue under the data room entitled
"Quartz" including the secured folders located therein, (ii) the provision of
hard copies of such items or information, or (iii) the provision of such items
or information in electronic format (including by fax, e-mail or by other
electronic means), in each case at least one (1) day prior to the date hereof.

Section 10.10. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which, including those received via facsimile
transmission or email (including in PDF format), shall be deemed an original,
and all of which shall constitute one and the same Agreement.

Section 10.11. Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If
any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or
any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable: (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

Section 10.12. Time of Essence. Time is of the essence for each and every
provision of this Agreement. Section 10.13. Injunctive Relief. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereunder will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by
Law on such party, and the exercise of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties will be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction (without the
requirement of posting a bond).

Section 10.14. Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Non-Assertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege.

(a) Buyer and Company hereby agree that, in the event that a dispute arises
out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement after the Closing
between Buyer (and/or the Company), on the one hand, and the Securityholders'
Representative or any Securityholder, on the other hand (a "Covered Dispute"),
then Perkins Coie LLP ("PC"), which has been retained by the Company to act as
counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, may represent
such Securityholder and/or the Securityholder Representative in such dispute
even though the interests of such Securityholder or the Securityholder
Representative may be directly adverse to Buyer or a Group Company, and even
though PC has represented a Group Company in connection with the negotiation
of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Buyer further agrees that, as to all communications among PC and a Group
Company, any Securityholder or the Securityholder Representative in connection
with a Covered Dispute, to the extent they relate to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents
(collectively, the "Privileged Communications"), the attorney-client privilege
and the exception of client confidence with respect to the Privileged
Communications belongs solely to the Securityholders and may be controlled
only by the Securityholder Representative and shall not pass to (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) or be claimed by Buyer, Buyer Parent or their
respective Affiliates, because the interests of Buyer, Buyer Parent or their

payment should be made to a third party pursuant to the terms of Section 8.2
of the Purchase Agreement, and (ii) desires to make a claim for payment from
the Indemnity Escrow Account in connection therewith in accordance with the
Purchase Agreement, then Buyer shall give written notice of such claim (a
"Payment Notice") to the Securityholder Representative and the Escrow Agent
stating in reasonable detail the events or circumstances which are the basis
for, and Buyer's good faith estimate of the amount (to the extent reasonably

doubt, shall be in addition to any other notice requirements and deliverables
required under the Purchase Agreement, including pursuant to Section 8.7
thereof. If the Securityholder Representative objects to such claim, the
Securityholder Representative shall give written notice of such objection (an
"Objection Notice") to Buyer and the Escrow Agent within thirty (30) days
after the date of receipt by each of the Escrow Agent and Securityholder
Representative of the Payment Notice (the "Objection Period"), and shall state
in the Objection Notice the basis for such objection in reasonable detail. If
no Objection Notice to Buyer's claim is delivered by the Securityholder
Representative prior to the end of the Objection Period, the claim set forth
in the Payment Notice shall be deemed approved and accepted by the
Securityholder Representative for all purposes under this Agreement and the

Agent in accordance with the Payment Notice no later than three (3) Business
Days following the end of the Objection Period. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Business Day" means a day other than any day on which banks are

Securityholder Representative shall attempt in good faith to resolve the
dispute and, if they are able to do so in whole or in part, shall give a Joint
Written Notice to the Escrow Agent setting forth the resolution of the dispute
and the portion of the Claim Amount allowed, if any. To the extent: (i) a
dispute is resolved in whole or in part in favor of a Buyer Indemnified
Person, the allowed portion of the Claim Amount shall be paid, as directed by
Buyer in the Joint Written Notice, to the applicable Buyer Indemnified
Persons, or the applicable third party, by the Escrow Agent no later than
three (3) Business Days following receipt of Joint Written Notice of such
resolution or (ii) the Objection Notice does not dispute the entire Claim
Amount, the undisputed portion of the Claim Amount shall be paid in accordance
with the Payment Notice no later than three (3) Business Days following
delivery of the Objection Notice.

(c)If Buyer and the Securityholder Representative are unable to fully resolve
a disputed claim set forth in an Objection Notice pursuant to Section 3.6(b)
above within thirty (30) days after the date of delivery of the Objection
Notice, the dispute (or the unresolved portion of the dispute) shall be
resolved pursuant to Section 10.8 of the Purchase Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Escrow Agent shall hold such funds until it receives
either: (i) Joint Written Notice or (ii) a judgment, order or decree of an
arbitrator, court or other judicial body that decided the disbursement of the
amounts reserved for such disputed claim, together with a certificate of the
presenting party to the effect that such judgment is final, non-appealable and
from a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator having proper authority,
upon which certificate the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely
without further investigation (a "Final Order"). For purposes of the foregoing
definition, "final, non-appealable" means that such order, judgment or decree
has not been reversed, stayed, modified or amended and, as to which (1) the
time to appeal, petition for certiorari, or move for reconsideration,
reargument or rehearing has expired and no timely appeal, petition for
certiorari, or motion for reconsideration, reargument or rehearing is pending,
(2) any right to appeal, petition for certiorari, or move for reconsideration,
reargument or rehearing has been waived in writing, or (3) if an appeal,
petition for certiorari, or motion for reconsideration, reargument or rehearing thereof
has been denied, the time to take any further appeal or to further petition
for certiorari or move for further reconsideration, reargument or rehearing
has expired. At any time the Escrow Agent may in good faith file an
interpleader action in any court of competent jurisdiction, and upon the
filing thereof, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to recover reasonable
attorneys' fees, expenses and other costs incurred in commencing and
maintaining any such interpleader action.



3.7 Limit on Allowed Claims. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be required to
pay in respect of claims contemplated in Section 3.6 hereof an amount in
excess of the then current balance of the Indemnity Escrow Account.



3.8 Disbursement of Balance of Indemnity Escrow Amount. The Escrow Agent shall
hold and/or distribute the Indemnity Escrow Amount in accordance with the
following:

Indemnity Escrow Amount associated with Pending Claims which are resolved in

Agent of a Final Order or a Joint Written Notice directing the Escrow Agent to
distribute such portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount to Buyer pursuant to
this Section 3.8(a). None of the Securityholder Representative, the
Securityholders or the Escrow Agent shall have any liability with respect to
the allocation of funds to be released among the Buyer Indemnified Parties
pursuant to Buyer's direction in this Agreement.



(b)Following the Indemnity Escrow Termination Date, the portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount associated with Pending Claims which are resolved in
favor of the Securityholders shall be paid, no later than three (3) Business
Days following receipt by the Escrow Agent of a Final Order or a Joint Written
Notice directing the Escrow Agent to distribute such portion of the Indemnity
Escrow Amount, to the Securityholder Representative (for further distribution
to the Securityholders in accordance with their respective Additional Pro Rata
Share, subject to Section 3.15) pursuant to this Section 3.8(b); provided,
however, that in no event shall any amount be paid to the Securityholder
Representative to the extent that doing so would leave the balance of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount less than the then Pending Claims. Neither Buyer nor
the Escrow Agent shall have any liability with respect to the allocation of
funds to be released by the Securityholder Representative to the
Securityholders.

(a)The duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder shall be purely ministerial in
nature. Under no circumstances will the Escrow Agent be deemed to be a

in reliance on such opinions.

of the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent may rely absolutely upon the genuineness

shall be entitled to retain the Escrow Amount until the Escrow Agent shall
have received (i) a Final Order directing delivery of the Escrow Amount, or
(ii) a Joint Written Notice, in which event Escrow Agent shall disburse such
portion of the Escrow Amount in accordance with such Final Order or Joint
Written Notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time the Escrow Agent
may file an interpleader action in any court of competent jurisdiction, and
upon the filing thereof, the Escrow Agent shall be relieved of all liability
as to the Escrow Amount and shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys'
fees, expenses and other costs incurred in commencing and maintaining any such
interpleader action.



3.10 Terms of Purchase Agreement; Indemnity of Escrow Agent. The obligations
and duties of the Escrow Agent are confined to those specifically set forth in
this Agreement, notwithstanding references herein to other documents or
agreements. In the event that any of the terms and provisions of any other

any of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the terms and provisions of
this Agreement shall govern and control the duties of the Escrow Agent in all
respects (solely as it relates to the Escrow Agent). In the event of any
conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Purchase
Agreement, solely as between Buyer and the Securityholder Representative, the
terms of the Purchase Agreement shall govern. The Escrow Agent shall not be
subject to, nor be under any obligation to ascertain or construe the terms and
conditions of any other instrument, or to interpret this Agreement in light of
any other agreement whether or not now or hereafter deposited with or
delivered to the Escrow Agent or referred to in this Agreement, nor shall the
Escrow Agent be obligated to inquire as to the form, execution, sufficiency,
or validity of any such instrument nor to inquire as to the identity,
authority, or rights of the person or persons executing or delivering same.

indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent harmless from any and all costs, damages,
expenses or claims, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which Escrow Agent
may incur or sustain as a result of or arising out of this Agreement or Escrow
Agent's exercise of any rights or performance of any duties hereunder, except
to the extent such costs, damages, expenses or claims are finally adjudicated
to have resulted from the Escrow Agent's gross negligence, bad faith, fraud or
willful misconduct (provided, that, as between themselves, each of Buyer and
the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders) shall
bear fifty percent (50%) of such obligation); however, to the extent any such
costs, damages, expenses or claims result from or are attributable to a
party's failure to provide a fully executed IRS Form W-8 or W-9 and/or such
other forms and documents that the Escrow Agent may reasonably request
pursuant to Section 4.13(c), such party shall be solely responsible for
indemnifying the Escrow Agent for such costs, damages, expenses or claims).



3.11 Exculpation; Limitation of Liability. The Escrow Agent shall not be
liable, directly or indirectly, for any (i) damages, losses or expenses
arising out of the services provided hereunder, other than damages, losses or
expenses which have been finally adjudicated to have directly resulted from
the Escrow Agent's breach of this Agreement, gross negligence, bad faith,
fraud or willful misconduct, or (ii) special, indirect or consequential
damages or losses of any kind whatsoever (including without limitation lost
profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the possibility of such
losses or damages and regardless of the form of action. The Escrow Agent shall
not incur any liability for not performing any act or fulfilling any
obligation hereunder by reason of any occurrence beyond its control
(including, but not limited to, any provision of any present or future law or
regulation or any act of any governmental authority, any act of God or war or
terrorism, or the unavailability of the Federal Reserve Bank wire services or
any electronic communication facility).



3.12 Acknowledgment by the Escrow Agent. By execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Escrow Agent acknowledges that the terms and provisions of this
Agreement are acceptable and it agrees to carry out the provisions of Article
III on its part.



3.13 Resignation or Removal of Escrow Agent; Successors.



(a)The Escrow Agent may resign as such following the giving of thirty (30)
days' prior written notice to Buyer and the Securityholder Representative.
Similarly, the Escrow Agent may be removed and replaced following mutual
agreement of Buyer and the Securityholder Representative and the giving of
thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Escrow Agent by Buyer and the
Securityholder Representative. In either event, the duties of the Escrow Agent
shall terminate thirty (30) days after the date of such notice (or as of such
earlier date as may be mutually agreeable between the Escrow Agent, on the one
hand, and Buyer and the Securityholder Representative, on the other hand); and
the Escrow Agent shall then deliver the balance of the Escrow Account then in
its possession to a successor Escrow Agent as shall be appointed by Buyer and
the Securityholder Representative as evidenced by a Joint Written Notice
delivered to the Escrow Agent. 

(b)If for any reason any successor bank or escrow company is unwilling to
serve as successor Escrow Agent or if Buyer and the Securityholder
Representative are unable to agree upon a successor or shall have failed to
appoint a successor prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days following the
date of the notice of resignation or removal, the then acting Escrow Agent may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor escrow agent or other appropriate relief; and any such resulting
appointment shall be binding upon all of the parties hereto.



(c)Every successor escrow agent appointed hereunder shall execute, acknowledge
and deliver to its predecessor and also to Buyer and the Securityholder
Representative, an instrument in writing accepting such appointment hereunder,
and thereupon such successor escrow agent, without any further act, shall
become fully vested with all the duties, responsibilities and obligations of
its predecessor and shall be deemed the Escrow Agent for all purposes under
this Agreement; but such predecessor shall, nevertheless, on the written
request of the successor escrow agent, Buyer or the Securityholder
Representative, execute and deliver an instrument or instruments transferring
to such successor escrow agent all the rights of such predecessor hereunder,
and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver all funds and property held by it
pursuant to this Agreement to the successor escrow agent. Should any
instrument be required by any successor escrow agent to more fully vest in
such successor escrow agent the duties, responsibilities and obligations
hereby vested or intended to be vested in the predecessor, any and all such
instruments in writing shall, on the request of Buyer or the Securityholder
Representative, be executed, acknowledged and delivered by the predecessor.



(d)Upon acknowledgment by any successor escrow agent of the receipt of the
then remaining balance of the Escrow Account, the then acting escrow agent
shall be fully released and relieved of all duties, responsibilities and
obligations under this Agreement.



3.14 Insolvency Matters.





(a)Subject to Section 4.13, Buyer and Securityholder Representative (on behalf
of all Securityholders) agree, as between Buyer and the Securityholders, that
to the extent permitted under generally accepted accounting principles, the
Securityholders shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow Amount for
accounting purposes, such that the Escrow Amount is shown as an asset of the
Securityholders on financial statements and other accounting-related records
of the Securityholders, and the Escrow Amount is not shown as an asset of
Buyer on similar records of Buyer.



(b)Buyer and the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of all
Securityholders) agree, as between Buyer and each of the Securityholders, that
in the event any of them becomes party or subject to a bankruptcy,
receivership, insolvency, or similar proceeding, the creditors of such party
shall have no right to any portion of the Escrow Amount unless and until such
party obtains the right to have such portion of the Escrow Amount released to
such party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (and in such case,
the rights of any such creditor(s) in such portion of the Escrow Amount shall
be no greater than the rights such party would have had in such portion in the
absence of such bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency, or similar proceeding).



3.15 Payments to Optionholders. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, any portion of the payments or disbursements to be made to the
Securityholder Representative hereunder which are ultimately payable to the
Optionholders pursuant to the Purchase Agreement shall be contributed to the
Company, and the Company shall pay such amounts (less applicable withholding
and any Taxes required to be paid by the Company with respect thereto) to the
applicable Optionholders on or before the next regularly scheduled payroll
date following such contribution. To the extent any Joint Written Notice
instructs the Escrow Agent to make disbursements to the Securityholder
Representative, such Joint Written Notice shall also state the aggregate
amount payable to the Optionholders, which amount shall be disbursed to the
Company pursuant to this Section 3.15.



ARTICLE IV.



MISCELLANEOUS



4.1 Assignment; Successors and Assigns; Third Parties. Except as otherwise
provided herein, no party to this Agreement shall convey, assign or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the
express written consent of all other parties; provided, however, that Buyer
may, upon the delivery to the Escrow Agent of (i) written evidence of such assignment in form and substance
satisfactory to the Escrow Agent, and (ii) all documentation, information, or
certificates as the Escrow Agent may reasonably request hereunder, or as may
be necessary from time to time in order for the Escrow Agent to comply with
Section 4.13 or Section 4.15 hereof, or, any "Know Your Customer" or similar
law, rule, regulation or policy to which the Escrow Agent is or may become
subject to, without the consent of the Securityholder Representative, assign
any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates
or to its lenders as collateral security or to any person or entity that
acquires (whether by merger, purchase of stock, purchase of assets or
otherwise) Buyer, or is the successor or surviving entity in any such
acquisition, merger or other transaction involving, Buyer (provided that if
Buyer so assigns its obligations, Buyer shall not be relieved of its
obligations hereunder in the event that any such assignee fails to perform
such obligations so assigned). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any banking
association or corporation into which the Escrow Agent may be merged,
converted or with which the Escrow Agent may be consolidated, or any
corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which
the Escrow Agent shall be a party, or any banking association or corporation
to which all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the
Escrow Agent shall be transferred, shall succeed to all the Escrow Agent's
rights, obligations and immunities hereunder without the execution or filing
of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto,
anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding; provided, however, that as
promptly as possible following completion of such transaction involving the
Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall deliver written notice thereof to Buyer
and the Securityholder Representative. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement is not intended to benefit,
and shall not run to the benefit of or be enforceable by, any other person or
entity other than the parties hereto and their successors and permitted
assigns.



4.2 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and, solely with respect to Buyer and the
Securityholder Representative, the Purchase Agreement set forth the entire
agreement and understanding among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements
and understandings, negotiations, inducements or conditions, express or
implied, oral or written, with respect thereto. In the event of any direct
conflict of the terms of this Agreement with the terms of the Purchase
Agreement, as with respect to the rights of the Securityholder Representative
and Buyer, the terms of the Purchase Agreement shall control and prevail;
provided, that in no event shall the Escrow Agent be bound by the terms of the
Purchase Agreement.



4.3 Amendment and Waiver; Cumulative Effect.



(a)To be effective, any amendment or waiver of or under this Agreement must be
in writing and signed by Buyer, the Securityholder Representative and the
Escrow Agent.



(b)Neither the failure of any party hereto to exercise any right, power or
remedy provided in this Agreement or to insist upon compliance by any other
party with its obligations hereunder, nor any custom or practice of the
parties at variance with the terms hereof shall constitute a waiver by such
party of its right to exercise any such right, power or remedy or to demand
such compliance; provided, that this Section 4.3 shall not extend any time
period provided for herein.



4.4 Severability. If a provision of this Agreement is deemed to be contrary to
law, that provision will be deemed separable from the remaining provisions of
this Agreement, and will not affect the validity, interpretation or effect of
the other provisions of either this Agreement or any agreement executed
pursuant to it or the application of that provision to other circumstances not
contrary to law.



4.5 Notices. All notices, consents, waivers, agreements or other
communications hereunder shall be deemed effective or to have been duly given
and made (and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made upon receipt)
only if in writing and if (a) served by personal delivery upon the party for
whom it is intended, (b) delivered by overnight air courier or (c) sent by

responsible for its own costs and expenses with respect to matters involving
this Agreement.



4.7 Governing Law; Arbitration; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial.



(a)This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws.



(b)Subject to the requirements of clause (c), each of the parties hereto: (i)
submits to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting or having
jurisdiction in Dover County, State of Delaware in any Action arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, (ii) agrees that all claims in respect of the
Action shall be heard and determined in any such court, and (iii) agrees not
to bring any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other
court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of any Action so brought and waives any bond, surety or other
security that might be required of any other party with respect thereto. Any
party may make service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of the
process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for giving of notices in Section
4.5. Nothing in this Section 4.7, however, will affect the right of any party
to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law.



(c)Other than with respect to any claim seeking damages against the Escrow
Agent, including without limitation, its affiliates, officers, directors,
successors and assigns, any action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration held in Dover County, State
of Delaware under the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial
Arbitration and Mediation Services/EnDispute (or its successor), except to the
extent that such rules are inconsistent with this Section 4.7(c), in which
case this Section 4.7(c) will govern. Except as may be otherwise expressly
provided herein, for any matter submitted to arbitration, the burden of proof
will be as it would be if the claim were litigated in a judicial proceeding
governed exclusively by the internal Laws of the State of Delaware applicable
to contracts executed, entered into and performed within the State of
Delaware, without regard to the principles of choice of law or conflicts of
law of any jurisdiction. The arbitrator to any such arbitration hearing shall
determine, in its sole discretion, which party(ies) are the non-prevailing
party(ies). Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
in any court having jurisdiction.



(d)EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF THE
PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
HEREOF.



4.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
each of which, including those received via facsimile transmission or email
(including in PDF format), shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall
constitute one and the same Agreement.



4.9 Interpretation.



(a) The Article and Section headings contained in this Agreement are solely
for the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the parties and
shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

(b) Unless the express context otherwise requires: (i) the words "hereof,"
"herein," and "hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in this
Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement; (ii) any reference to the masculine, feminine or
neuter gender shall include all genders, the plural shall include the
singular, and the singular shall include the plural; (iii) references herein
to a specific Article, Section, Subsection or Exhibit shall refer,
respectively, to Articles, Sections, Subsections or Exhibits of this
Agreement; (iv) wherever the word "include," "includes," or "including" is
used in this Agreement, it shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation;" (v) the word "or" shall be inclusive and not exclusive
(for example, the phrase "A or B" means "A or B or both," not "either A or B
but not both"), unless used in conjunction with "either" or the like; (vi)
each reference to any Contract shall be to such Contract as amended,
supplemented, waived or otherwise modified from time to time; (vii) each
reference to a Law, statute, regulation or other government rule is to it as
amended from time to time and, as applicable, is to corresponding provisions
of successor Laws, statutes, regulations or other government rules; and (viii)
each reference to a "party" means a party to this Agreement.

(c) Any deadline or time period set forth in this Agreement that by its terms
ends on a day that is not a Business Day shall be automatically extended to
the next succeeding Business Day.

(d) With regard to each and every term and condition of this Agreement, the
parties understand and agree that the same have or has been mutually
negotiated, prepared and drafted, and that if at any time the parties desire
or are required to interpret or construe any such term or condition or any
agreement or instrument subject thereto, no consideration shall be given to
the issue of which party actually prepared, drafted or requested any term or
condition of this Agreement.

4.10 Further Assurances. Each party hereto, at the reasonable request of
another party hereto, shall execute and deliver such other instruments and do
and perform such other acts and things as may be necessary or desirable for
effecting completely the consummation of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.



4.11 Books and Records. The Escrow Agent shall maintain books and records
regarding its administration of the Escrow Account and the deposit,
investment, collections and disbursements or transfers of the Escrow Amount,
shall retain copies of written notices and directions sent or received by it
in the performance of its duties hereunder, and shall afford Buyer and the Securityholder Representative reasonable
access, during regular business hours, to review and make photocopies (at such
party's cost) of the same.



4.12 Brokerage Confirmation Waiver. Buyer and the Securityholder
Representative hereby: (a) acknowledge that regulations of the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency grant them the right to receive brokerage
confirmations of security transactions as they occur, and (b) specifically
waive such notification to the extent permitted by Law and acknowledge that
they will receive periodic cash transaction statements, which will detail all
investment transactions.



4.13 Tax Matters.



(a)The parties agree that (i) the Escrow Amount is owned by the Buyer for U.S.
federal and state income tax purposes until distributed pursuant to the terms
of the Purchase Agreement and this Agreement and (ii) upon any release of the
Escrow Amount to the Securityholder Representative (for further distribution
to the Securityholders in accordance with their respective Additional Pro Rata
Share, subject to Section 3.15), the portion of the released amount that
constitutes interest under the Code will be treated for federal and state
income tax purposes as a payment of interest to the Securityholders, and Buyer
will be permitted a corresponding interest deduction in accordance with
Section 483 of the Code or Treasury Regulation Section 1.1275-4(c) (it being
understood that Buyer shall be responsible for computations under such
Treasury Regulation). The parties agree that, for tax reporting purposes, all
interest and other income earned on the Escrow Amount in any tax year, which
tax year in any tax year shall be the period from January 1-December 31 (each
period, a "Tax Year") shall be reported as allocated to Buyer. Unless
otherwise required by law, the parties agree to file all tax returns on a
basis consistent with the foregoing reporting. Unless otherwise required by
law, the Escrow Agent shall have no duty to prepare or file any information
reports (including without limitation IRS Forms 1099-B) other than such
information reports of interest earned on the Escrow Amount as the Escrow
Agent is required to prepare and file in the ordinary course of its business.
The Escrow Agent shall have no obligation to report any amounts to the parties
resulting from the deposit of the Escrow Amount or the release of the Escrow
Amount as a result of or related to the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement.



(b)The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount
distributed or released from the Escrow Amount all taxes which are required to
be deducted or withheld under any provision of applicable tax law. All such
withheld amounts that are paid to the proper taxing authority shall be treated
as having been delivered to the party entitled to the amount distributed or
released in respect of which such tax has been deducted or withheld.

(c)Buyer and the Securityholder Representative shall each furnish the Escrow
Agent with an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or Form W-9, properly
completed and signed, and such other forms and documents that the Escrow Agent
may reasonably request.



4.14 Further Assurances. No party to this Agreement is (or will be) a person
with whom the Escrow Agent is restricted from doing business under regulations
of the Office of Foreign Asset Control ("OFAC") of the Department of the
Treasury of the United States of America (including, those persons named on
OFAC's Specially Designated and Blocked Persons list) or under any statute,
executive order (including, the September 24, 2001 Executive Order Blocking
Property and Prohibiting Transactions With Persons Who Commit, Threaten to
Commit, or Support Terrorism), or other governmental action and is not and
shall not engage in any dealings or transactions or otherwise be associated
with such persons. The parties acknowledge that prior to the establishment of
the Escrow Account and from time to time throughout the term of the Agreement,
the Escrow Agent is authorized to establish and effectuate identity
verification procedures to obtain information which may be used to confirm the
parties' identity of such party and their authorized representatives including
without limitation name, address and organizational documents or driver's
license ("Identifying Information") to the extent required by applicable law
or the policies and procedures of the Escrow Agent. The parties agree to
provide the Escrow Agent with and consent to the Escrow Agent obtaining from
third parties any such Identifying Information required as a condition of
opening an account with or using any service provided by the Escrow Agent
hereunder.



4.15 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT. To help
the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities,
Federal law requires all financial institutions (which includes the Escrow
Agent) to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person or
entity who opens an account, including any deposit or treasury management
account. What this means for the Parties: For a non-individual person such as
a business entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity, the Escrow Agent
will ask for documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal
entity, including a list of affiliates and subsidiaries, if necessary. The
Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements, licenses, identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming
authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation. For an
individual person, the Escrow Agent may ask for your name, address, date of
birth and other information that will allow the Escrow Agent to identify you.
The Escrow Agent may also ask to see the individual's driver's license or
other identifying documents. In the event any Party (or their respective
Authorized Representatives) violates any of the provisions of the Section 326
of the USA Patriot Act of 2001, 31 U.S.C. Section 5318 or the regulations
purported thereunder, such event shall constitute a default hereunder and
shall entitle Escrow Agent to exercise all of its rights and remedies at law
or in equity, including, but not limited to, terminating this Agreement

Scott Peyree Exhibit D

OPTION CANCELLATION AGREEMENT

This Option Cancellation Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered into as of
[________], 2018, by and between the undersigned holder (the "Optionholder")
and QuoteWizard.com, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the
"Company").

RECITALS

A. The Company has entered into that certain Unit Purchase Agreement (the
"Purchase Agreement"), dated of as October 4, 2018, by and among, LendingTree,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Buyer"), the Company, the members
of the Company named therein (the "Members"), and Scott Peyree, as the
securityholder representative (the "Securityholder Representative"), pursuant
to which Buyer will acquire from the Members all of the issued and outstanding
equity interests of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, all
capitalized terms shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the
Purchase Agreement unless otherwise defined herein.

B. Optionholder is the holder of an option or options to purchase Class B
Units of the Company (the "Company Units") as set forth in Exhibit A (the
"Options") pursuant to an award or awards under the terms of the
QuoteWizard.com, LLC 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Company Plan").

C. Section 12.3(a) of the Company Plan provides that, unless the Plan
Administrator (as defined in the Company Plan) determines otherwise in its
sole discretion, Awards (as defined in the Company Plan) shall terminate upon
a Change of Control (as defined in the Company Plan). Section 7.4(a) of the
Company Plan provides that the Plan Administrator has the power to waive or
modify any provisions relating to the time(s) at which, or installments in
which, the Options shall vest and/or become exercisable.

D. Section 12.3(c) of the Company Plan provides that in connection with any
Change of Control, the Plan Administrator may, among other things, provide
that outstanding Options shall terminate upon or immediately prior to such
Change of Control and that the Optionholder shall receive, in exchange
therefor, a cash payment equal to the amount (if any) by which (i) (x) fair
market value of the securities, cash or other property, or any combination
thereof, receivable or deemed receivable upon a Change of Control in respect
of a Company Unit, as determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole
discretion, multiplied by (y) the number of Company Units subject to such
outstanding Options (whether or not then vested) exceeds (ii) the aggregate
exercise price with respect to such Options.

E. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and Section 12.3(a) of the Company Plan,
all Options that are outstanding and unexercised as of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (the "Effective Time")
shall be cancelled. Prior to the Effective Time, the Options will remain
subject to their existing terms as set forth under the Company Plan and the
corresponding Option Grant Notices and Option Agreements.

F. The Company is offering the Optionholder and each other holder of Options
the right to enter into this Agreement, which includes a release for the
Company, its Members, Buyer, and certain other persons, in exchange for the
right to receive the consideration described below.

AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration including the acceleration
of unvested options, if applicable, and the elimination of any requirement to
pay the option exercise price to the Company, the parties hereby agree as
follows:

1.Treatment of Options. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, conditioned
upon execution of this Agreement by Optionholder, (a) immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and contingent upon, the Closing, the vesting of all unvested
Options, if any, will be accelerated such that such Options shall be fully
vested and exercisable and (b) at the Effective Time, each Option that is held
by Optionholder and outstanding, vested and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to the
acceleration of vesting of such Options pursuant to the preceding clause (a)),
shall be canceled at the Effective Time in exchange for (i) the amount equal
to (A) the product of (x) the amount, if any, by which (1) Per Unit Amount
exceeds (2) the per Unit exercise price, as set forth on Exhibit A, multiplied
by (y) the number of Company Units subject to such Option and vested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Company Plan (such amount, the "Option Payment Amount"),
plus (ii) the right for the Optionholder to receive his or her Additional Pro
Rata Share of one or more distributions of any (A) Escrow Amount by the Escrow
Agent due and payable pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and the Purchase
Agreement and (B) Representative Expense Amount due and payable pursuant to
the Purchase Agreement, in each case in respect of such Option, plus (iii) the
right for the Optionholder to receive his or her Additional Pro Rata Share of
one or more Earnout payments, if any, due and payable pursuant to Section 2.5
of the Purchase Agreement in respect of such Option. Buyer shall contribute
the Option Payment Amount to the Company, and the Company shall pay such
amount (less applicable withholding and any Taxes required to be paid by the
Company with respect thereto) to the Optionholder through special payroll on
the Closing Date. Optionholder hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Per
Unit Amount and the Option Payment Amount may be subject to adjustment at
Closing pursuant to Section 2.2 of the Purchase Agreement. Optionholder
further acknowledges and agrees that Optionholder is bound by, and amounts
received hereunder are subject to further adjustment under, Section 2.3 and
Section 2.4 of the Purchase Agreement.



2.Waiver of Notice; Termination of Option Agreements.



(a)Optionholder hereby waives any notice or consent rights, if any, under the
Company Plan and any option agreements previously entered into between the
Company and Optionholder (the "Option Agreements").



(b)Optionholder agrees that all Option Agreements and any rights thereunder
are terminated, canceled, forfeited and surrendered as of the Effective Time
with no further liability or obligation on the part of Buyer, the Members, the
Company or the Optionholder thereunder, except as specifically provided
herein.



(c)In the event Optionholder fails to execute and deliver this Agreement to
the Company on or before the Closing, then this Agreement shall be null and
void and Optionholder shall not receive any Option Payment Amount, as
contemplated herein, for any Options, but in any event all unexercised
outstanding Options shall be canceled and terminate as of the Closing pursuant
to Section 12.3(a) of the Company Plan.



3.Withholding and Tax Matters. The parties agree and acknowledge that
Optionholder is responsible for payment of all Taxes imposed upon Optionholder
in connection with the cancellation of the Options and the Option Payment
Amount and neither the Company nor Buyer shall have any liability to
Optionholder or any other party with respect to any such Taxes.
Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, the parties agree and
acknowledge that the Option Payment Amount will be paid by Company (less
applicable withholding and any other Taxes required to be paid with respect
thereto) through a special payroll on the Closing Date through the Company's
payroll. Optionholder hereby acknowledges that (a) no representations have
been made with respect to the Tax treatment of any consideration that may be
received pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement,
(b) Optionholder is in no manner relying on the Company, Buyer, or any of

financial advisors with respect to such Tax treatment. The parties intend that
this Agreement will be governed by the provisions of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(iv)(A), and this Agreement will be interpreted and
administered consistently with such intent.



4.No Transfer or Assignment. Optionholder may not sell, exchange, transfer or
otherwise dispose of Optionholder's right to receive the Option Payment Amount
or any portion thereof. Any transfer in violation of this Section 4 shall be
null and void and need not be recognized by the Company, Buyer, or the
Securityholder Representative.



5.Representations, Warranties and Covenants. Optionholder hereby represents,
warrants and covenants to the Company that as of the date of this Agreement
and as of the Closing Date:

actions necessary, to authorize, execute and deliver this Agreement, and to
perform Optionholder's obligations hereunder and under the Purchase Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents.



(b)This Agreement, when executed and delivered by the parties hereto, will

rights and general principles of equity affecting the availability of specific
performance and other equitable remedies.



(c)The execution, delivery and performance by Optionholder of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will
not: (i) conflict with, or result in the breach of, or constitute a default
under, or result in the termination, cancellation, material modification or
acceleration (whether after the filing of notice or the lapse of time or both)
of any right or obligation of Optionholder under, or result in a loss of any
benefit to which Optionholder is entitled under, any Contract to which
Optionholder is a party or (ii) violate or result in a breach of or constitute
a default under any Law or Governmental Authorization to which Optionholder is
subject.



(d)Optionholder holds (of record and beneficially) and has good and valid
title to the Options free and clear of all Liens (other than any community
property interest of Optionholder\'s spouse, in which case Optionholder\'s
spouse shall have executed the Spousal Consent attached hereto as Exhibit B
and restrictions on transfer imposed by applicable securities laws).
Optionholder has the right to surrender the Options and has not made any sale
or transfer of the Options.



(e)Except as set forth on Exhibit A, Optionholder has not exercised any of the
Options, and Optionholder agrees not to exercise any of the Options on or at
any time prior to the Effective Time.



(f)Optionholder agrees that the Options listed on Exhibit A represent and true
and complete list of all of the outstanding options or other rights to receive
Company Units or any other equity interests of the Company held by
Optionholder.



(g)OPTIONHOLDER HAS REVIEWED THIS AGREEMENT AND THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, AND
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH THE TAX, FINANCIAL AND LEGAL COUNSEL OF
OPTIONHOLDER'S CHOOSING REGARDING THIS AGREEMENT, AND HAS DONE SO OR KNOWINGLY

(h)If any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement, Optionholder agrees to take such action as is necessary and

6.Spousal Consent. If the Optionholder is a resident of a community property
interest state, the Optionholder\'s spouse has executed and delivered the
Spousal Consent attached hereto as Exhibit B concurrently with the
Optionholder\'s execution and delivery of this Agreement.



7.Release.



(a)The Optionholder, on behalf of himself, herself or itself, the
Optionholder's Affiliates, and their respective successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Releasors"), hereby knowingly and voluntarily releases and
forever discharges, effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer, the Company and
Wizard Enterprises and each of their respective past, present and/or future
Affiliates and Representatives (collectively, the "Released Parties"), from
any and all Actions, claims, suits, controversies, causes of action, cross-
claims, counter claims, demands, debts, compensatory damages, liquidated
damages, punitive or exemplary damages, other damages, claims for costs and
attorneys' fees, or liabilities of any nature whatsoever in law and in equity,
whether known or unknown, liquidated or contingent, which the Optionholder or
any other Releasor ever had or now have relating to, arising out of or in any
way connected with the dealings of Buyer, the Company, Wizard Enterprises or
the other Released Parties, on the one hand, and the Optionholder and the other Releasors, on the other hand, or any
circumstance, agreement, action, omission, event or matter occurring or
existing between them, in each case, prior to the Closing Date (collectively,
the "Released Claims"); provided, however, that the Released Claims shall not
include: (i) any matters arising under or relating to the terms, conditions or
other provisions or obligations under this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including, for
the avoidance of doubt, rights to indemnification under the Company's
Organizational Documents contemplated in Section 6.11 of the Purchase
Agreement, (ii) rights to any accrued but unpaid compensation owed by a Group
Company to the Optionholder or other Releasor as of the Closing and that is
reflected in the Closing Working Capital or included in the Closing Company
Transaction Expenses, (iii) rights to any accrued but unpaid business expenses
of the Optionholder to the extent that such expenses are incurred and
reimbursable under the Group Companies' existing company policies or (iv)
rights under any Benefit Plan maintained, contributed to or sponsored by any
Group Company as of the Closing.



(b)The Optionholder acknowledges that the Laws of many states provide
substantially the following:



"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

The Optionholder acknowledges that such provisions are designed to protect a
party from waiving claims which he, she or it does not know exist or may
exist. Nonetheless, the Optionholder agrees that, effective as of the Closing
Date, the Optionholder and the other Releasors shall be deemed to waive any
such provision.

(c)The Optionholder further agrees that no party shall, nor permit any
Affiliate thereof to: (i) institute a lawsuit or other legal proceeding based
upon, arising out of, or relating to any of the Released Claims, (ii)
participate, assist, or cooperate in any such proceeding or (iii) encourage,
assist and/or solicit any third party to institute any such proceeding.



8.Purchase Agreement. Optionholder hereby irrevocably agrees to be bound by
the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement (including the other
Transaction Documents) as an "Optionholder" and as a "Securityholder" (in each
case, as such term is defined and used in the Purchase Agreement) as though
Optionholder were a signatory thereto, including, but not limited to (a)
Section 1.7 of the Purchase Agreement, (b) Article 2 of the Purchase
Agreement, (c) covenants applicable to Optionholders and Securityholders in
the Purchase Agreement including, without limitation, Section 6.4 (Public
Disclosure; Confidentiality) of the Purchase Agreement, Section 6.5 (Exclusive
Dealing) of the Purchase Agreement, Section 6.10 (Further Assurances) of the
Purchase Agreement and Section 6.11 (Directors' and Officers' Indemnification
and Exculpation) of the Purchase Agreement, Article 8 of the Purchase
Agreement, (d) the indemnification obligations of Securityholders under the
Purchase Agreement, including those set forth in Article 8 of the Purchase
Agreement and (e) Article 10 of the Purchase Agreement, including the
appointment of the Securityholder Representative as Optionholder's sole and
exclusive representative and true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact with
the powers and authority as set forth in Section 10.1 of the Purchase
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Optionholder
hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) Optionholder's Securityholder Pro Rata
Share is the percentage set forth on Exhibit A as "Securityholder Pro Rata
Share" and (ii) Optionholder's Additional Pro Rata Share is the percentage set
forth on Exhibit A as "Additional Pro Rata Share," and as such, subject to the
terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, Optionholder may be entitled
to receive only Optionholder's Additional Pro Rata Share of the portion of the
Earnout payments, if any, when and solely to the extent such amounts are due
and payable to the Securityholders pursuant to the terms of the Purchase
Agreement.



9.Miscellaneous.



(a)Effectiveness. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this
Agreement shall automatically become null and void and shall be of no further
force and effect upon the termination of the Purchase Agreement.

 (b)Governing Law; Arbitration; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial.



(i)The internal Laws of the State of Delaware, irrespective of its conflict of
laws principles, will govern the validity of this Agreement.



(ii)Subject to the requirements of clause (iii), each of the parties hereto:
(A) submits to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting or
having jurisdiction in Dover County, State of Delaware in any Action arising
out of or relating to this Agreement, (B) agrees that all claims in respect of
the Action shall be heard and determined in any such court, and (C) agrees not
to bring any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other
court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of any Action so brought and waives any bond, surety or other
security that might be required of any other party with respect thereto. Any
party may make service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of the
process to the party to be served in the manner provided for giving of notices
in Section 10.2 of the Purchase Agreement to the address set forth therein
(with respect to the Company or Buyer), or to an address set forth in the
signature page hereto (with respect to Optionholder). Nothing in this Section
9(b), however, will affect the right of any party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by law.



(iii)Any Action or arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
resolved by binding arbitration held in Dover County, State of Delaware under
the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and
Mediation Services/EnDispute (or its successor), except to the extent that
such rules are inconsistent with this Section 9(b)(iii), in which case this
Section 9(b)(iii) will govern. Except as may be otherwise expressly provided
herein, for any matter submitted to arbitration, the burden of proof will be
as it would be if the claim were litigated in a judicial proceeding governed
exclusively by the internal Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed, entered into and performed within the State of Delaware,
without regard to the principles of choice of law or conflicts of law of any
jurisdiction. The arbitrator to any such arbitration hearing shall determine,
in its sole discretion, which party(ies) are the non-prevailing party(ies).
Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction.



(c)EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF THE
PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
HEREOF.



(d)Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable
and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable: (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.



(e)Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
each of which, including those received via facsimile transmission or email
(including in PDF format), shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall
constitute one and the same Agreement.

 (f)Third Party Beneficiary. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties and their respective successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. Each of the Company and Optionholder
acknowledges and agrees that Buyer, its successors, legal representatives and
permitted assigns, the Released Parties, Securityholder Indemnified Persons
(other than Optionholder), and the Buyer Indemnified Persons are express third
party beneficiaries of this Agreement. Except as set forth in the preceding
sentence, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer
upon any Person other the Company and Optionholder and their respective
successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns, any rights, benefits
or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

 EXHIBIT B



Spousal Consent



The undersigned spouse of ____________ hereby acknowledges that I have read
this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement and that I understand their
contents. I am aware that this Agreement provides that, in lieu of my spouse
exercising his or her Options, my spouse desires to cancel all of his or her
Options in exchange for the Option Payment Amount. I agree to the foregoing
cancellation and payment pursuant to this Agreement and acknowledge that my
community property interest, if any, shall be similarly bound by this
Agreement.



I am aware that the legal, financial and other matters contained in this
Agreement and the Purchase Agreement are complex and I am free to seek advice
with respect thereto from independent counsel. I have either sought such
advice or determined after carefully reviewing this Agreement that I will (and
if the latter case, hereby do) waive such right.
