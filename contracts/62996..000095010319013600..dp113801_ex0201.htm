Business Days prior to the Closing) the Estimated Transaction Expenses so
identified, if any and (ii) to the holders thereof (as

  



    

17

 

    

identified in the Payoff Letters and otherwise pursuant to the Payoff
Letters) the amount of any Funded Indebtedness included in the
Estimated Closing Indebtedness.

  



  

Section 2.06.   _Adjustment Amount_. (a) As soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date, and in any event within 75 calendar
days thereof, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller, (i) a calculation of
Closing Net Working Capital, (ii) a calculation of the aggregate amount of
all Closing Indebtedness, (iii) a calculation of Closing Cash, (iv) a
calculation of Transaction Expenses, (v) Buyer's calculation of the Closing
Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount, and (vi) on the basis of the foregoing,
a calculation of the Closing Purchase Price (together with the calculations
referred to in clauses (i) through (vi) above, the "Final Closing
Statement"). The Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing
Cash shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles and the
defined terms used in this Section 2.06(a); _provided_ , _however_ , the
Final Closing Statement (and any amounts included therein) shall not give
effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any act or omission by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
or the Companies taken at, after or in connection with the Closing or reflect
any payments of cash in respect of the Purchase Price, or any financing
transactions in connection therewith or reflect any expense or liability for
which Buyer is responsible under this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, the calculations and the purchase price adjustment to be made pursuant
to this Section 2.06 are only meant to reflect the proper calculation of
Closing Purchase Price (and the inputs thereto) in accordance with the
applicable definitions contained therein and otherwise in this Agreement and
the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement. Nothing in this
Section 2.06 is intended to be used to adjust for errors or omissions that
may be found with respect to the Financial Statements or any inconsistencies
between the Accounting Principles, on the one hand, and GAAP, on the other. No
fact or event, including any market or business development, occurring after
the Closing, and no change in GAAP or Applicable Law after the Balance Sheet
Date, shall be taken into consideration in the calculations to be made
pursuant to Section 2.04 or this Section 2.06. If Buyer fails to timely
deliver the Final Closing Statement in accordance with the first sentence of
this Section 2.06(a) within such 75-day period, then, at the election of
Seller in its sole discretion either (x) the Preliminary Closing
Statement delivered by Seller to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.04 shall be
deemed to be the Final Closing Statement, for all purposes hereunder or (y)
Seller shall be entitled to retain (at the sole cost and expense of Buyer) an
independent accounting firm of recognized national standing to provide an
audit of the books of the Companies, determine the calculation of, and
prepare, the Final Closing Statement consistent with the provisions of this
Section 2.06(a), the determination of such independent accounting firm being
conclusive, final and binding on the parties hereto.

  



  

(b)  Following the Closing, Buyer shall provide Seller and its
Representatives access to the records, properties, personnel and (subject to
the execution of customary work paper access letters if requested) auditors of
the Companies relating to the preparation of the Final Closing Statement and
shall cause the personnel of the Companies to cooperate with Seller in
connection with its review of the Final Closing Statement.

  



    

18

 

    

(c)  If Seller shall disagree with any of Buyer's calculations
contained in the Final Closing Statement, Seller shall notify Buyer of such
disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of
such disagreement, within 60 days after their receipt of the Final Closing
Statement. In the event that Seller does not provide such a notice of
disagreement within such 60 day period, Seller shall be deemed to have agreed
to the Final Closing Statement (including the determinations included
therein) delivered by Buyer, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for
all purposes hereunder. In the event any such notice of disagreement is
timely provided, Buyer and Seller shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts for a period of 30 days (or such longer period as they may mutually
agree) to resolve any disagreements with respect to any calculations
contained in the Final Closing Statement. If, at the end of such period,
Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve such disagreements, then any such
remaining disagreements (such remaining disagreements, the "Disputed Items")
shall, at the written request of either Buyer or Seller, be resolved by one
of the "big four" accounting firms that is mutually selected by Buyer and
Seller (who shall not have any material relationship with Seller, Buyer or any
of their respective Affiliates) (such firm, the "Auditor"). Buyer and Seller
shall promptly provide their assertions regarding the Disputed Items in
writing to the Auditor and to each other. The Auditor shall be instructed to
render its determination with respect to the Disputed Items as soon as
reasonably possible (which the parties hereto agree should not be later than
60 days following the date on which the disagreement is referred to the
Auditor). The Auditor shall base its determination solely on (i) the written
submissions of the parties and shall not conduct an independent investigation
and (ii) the extent (if any) to which Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Transaction Expenses require adjustment
(only with respect to the Disputed Items submitted to the Auditor) in order
to be determined in accordance with Section 2.06(a) (including the definitions
of the defined terms used in Section 2.06(a)). The Auditor shall not assign a
value to any Disputed Item submitted to the Auditor greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either party. The determination of the Auditor shall
be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The date on which
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash, Transaction
Expenses, Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount and Closing Purchase
Price are finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.06(c) is
hereinafter referred to as the "Determination Date." All fees and expenses of
the Auditor relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Auditor
hereunder shall be borne between Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the
other hand, based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of
the aggregate amount of the Disputed Items not awarded to the applicable party
and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of the Disputed Items.
For example, if Seller challenges items underlying the calculations of
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or
Transaction Expenses in the net amount of $1,000,000, and the Auditor
determines that Seller has a valid claim for $400,000 of the $1,000,000,
Seller shall bear 60% of the fees and expenses of the Auditor and Buyer shall
bear 40% of the fees and expenses of the Auditor.

  



  

(d)  The "Adjustment Amount," which may be positive or negative,
shall mean the Closing Purchase Price (as finally determined in accordance
with Section 2.06(a) or

  



    

19

 

    

2.06(c), as applicable) minus the Estimated Closing Purchase Price. The
Adjustment Amount shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.06(e).

  



  

(e)  If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number (such amount,
the "Increase Amount"), then, promptly following the Determination Date, and
in any event within three Business Days of the Determination Date, Buyer shall
pay to Seller an amount equal to the Increase Amount in immediately available
funds by wire transfer to Seller's Bank Account or such other
account designated by Seller. If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number
(the absolute value of such amount, the "Deficit Amount"), then, promptly
following the Determination Date, and in any event within three Business Days
of the Determination Date, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the
Deficit Amount in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an
account of Buyer designated by Buyer.

  



  

Section 2.07.   _Withholding_. Any amounts payable under this Agreement
shall be made free and clear of any withholding or deduction for Taxes or for
any other reason, unless such withholding or deduction is required by
Applicable Law. Any amounts required to be withheld or deducted by Applicable
Law shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person with respect to which such deduction or withholding was imposed.
If Buyer reasonably believes that it is required to deduct and withhold from
the payment of any amounts payable hereunder under Applicable Law, Buyer shall
(a) promptly notify Seller that Buyer is required by Applicable Law to
withhold from any amount payable to Seller under this Agreement, which notice
shall include a description of the legal and factual basis for such
withholding and the applicable rate thereof, and (b) use reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with Seller to minimize or eliminate the amount of any
Taxes required to be deducted and withheld under Applicable Law.

the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (a) materially
violate the applicable organizational or governing documents of Seller or any

liabilities of the Business that would be required by GAAP to be reflected or
reserved against on a balance sheet of the Business, other than (a)
liabilities provided for in the Financial Statements or disclosed in the
notes thereto; (b) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
since the Balance Sheet Date; (c) liabilities incurred in connection with the

agreements, instruments or documents contemplated hereby; (ii) consummation of
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; nor (iii) Buyer's

financial statements in accordance with GAAP.

  



  

(d)  No Action is pending or, to Seller's knowledge, threatened
with regard to any Company Benefit Plan other than routine claims for

Company is pending or, to Seller's knowledge, threatened with regard to any
Seller Benefit Plan, except as would not be reasonably expected to result in
material liability to the Companies, taken as a whole.

  



  

(e)  None of the Companies or any predecessor thereof or any ERISA
Affiliate sponsors, maintains or contributes to, has an obligation to
contribute to, or has any liability, or has in the past six (6) years
sponsored, maintained or contributed to, or had an obligation to contribute
to, or had any liability with respect to, any plan that is subject to Title IV
of ERISA or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, including any
Multiemployer Plan.

  



  

(f)  None of the Companies or any ERISA Affiliates have any
material liability (including liability on account of an
indemnification obligation) on account of a violation of Part 6 of Subtitle B
of Title I of ERISA, Section 4980B of the Code (or similar applicable state
or local Law) ("COBRA").

  



  

(g)  Each Company Benefit Plan and each Seller Benefit Plan that is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and
has received a favorable determination, advisory, or opinion letter from the
IRS or has applied to the IRS for such a letter within the applicable
remedial amendment period or such period has not expired, and no circumstances
exist which could reasonably be expected to result in a loss of such
qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code.

  



  

(h)  No Company or Company Benefit Plan provides or has an
obligation to provide post-employment or post-retirement health, medical,
life insurance, or welfare benefits for retired, former or current employees
of the Business or the Companies (or any beneficiaries thereof), except as
required to avoid excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code.

  



  

(i)  Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein (either alone or in
combination with another event), will (i) entitle any current or former
employee of any Company to

  



    

27

 

    

severance pay or to any other payment, benefit or award under any Company
Benefit Plan or Seller Benefit Plan, (ii) cause any payment, acceleration,
vesting or increase in benefits under a Company Benefit Plan or to any Company
Employee under any Employee Benefit Plan except under applicable Law, or
(iii) result in any forgiveness of indebtedness or trigger any funding

and enforceable agreement of Buyer, subject, in the case of enforceability,

Section 4.03.   _Governmental Authorization_. Performance of this
Agreement by Buyer requires no action by or in respect of, or filing with,
any Governmental Authority other than (a) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the HSR Act and (b) any actions or filings, the absence of
which would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
materially impair or delay Buyer's ability to perform or comply with its
obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. Buyer is not aware of any reason why any actions by or
in respect of, or filings with, any Governmental Authority referred to in
Section 4.03 will not be made or obtained promptly after the date hereof and
in any event by the End Date.

  



  

Section 4.04.   _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and
performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby

  



    

33

 

    

do not and will not (a) materially violate the organizational documents of
Buyer; (b) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.03,
violate any Applicable Law, require any consent or other action by any Person
under, constitute a default under, or give rise to any right of termination,

obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  



  

Section 4.05.   _Financing_. (a) Buyer has delivered to Seller on or
prior to the date hereof true and complete copies of a fully executed
commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, by and among Buyer,
Manufacturers and Traders Trust Bank and MI Windows and Doors, LLC, including
all annexes, exhibits, schedules and other attachments thereto and all
executed fee letters associated therewith (with such fee letters redacted on
a customary basis and solely in respect of the amounts, percentages and basis
points of compensation and other similar economics and the pricing and other
terms of the "flex" provisions, in each case, set forth therein) (as may be
amended or replaced, in each case subject to the terms of Section 5.14, the
"Commitment Letter"), pursuant to which the lenders and other parties thereto
have committed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein,
to provide Buyer with debt financing in the amounts set forth therein in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and to pay related fees
and expenses (collectively, the "Financing"; and the Estimated Closing

not been amended, waived or modified in any respect (in whole or in part) and
has not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded (or the respective commitments
contained therein otherwise reduced) (in whole or in part), nor, to the
knowledge of Buyer, is any such amendment, waiver, modification, withdrawal
or rescission currently contemplated or the subject of discussions (other than
in connection with the entry by Debt Financing Sources into joinders to the
Commitment Letter as expressly permitted by the terms of the Commitment Letter
as in effect on the date hereof). As of the date hereof, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default or breach under the Commitment Letter on the part
of Buyer or, to the knowledge of Buyer, any other party thereto. Buyer is not
aware of any fact, event or other occurrence that makes any of the
representations and warranties of Buyer or its Affiliates in the Commitment
Letter inaccurate in any material respect. There are no conditions precedent
or other contingencies (directly or indirectly) related to the funding of the
Financing (including any flex provisions) in an aggregate amount necessary to
satisfy the Required Amount other than the conditions precedent expressly set
forth in the

  



    

34

 

    

Commitment Letter, and, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in Section 8.01(a) and 8.01(b), as of the date hereof, Buyer has no reason to
believe that (i) any condition to the closing of the Financing contemplated by
the Commitment Letter will not be satisfied on a timely basis, or (ii) the
Financing in an amount necessary to satisfy the Required Amount will not be
made available to Buyer at or prior to the Closing. Other than the Commitment
Letter, there are no side letters or other contracts, arrangements,
agreements or understandings (written or oral) directly or indirectly related
to the conditions of the funding of the Financing. Buyer has fully paid, or
caused to be paid, any and all commitment fees and any and all other fees and
expenses, in each case as are required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the
Commitment Letter and are payable on or prior to the date hereof.

have sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of
immediately available funds (including pursuant to the Financing) to satisfy
the Required Amount.

  



  

(d)  Buyer is not entering into the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors of the Business. At and immediately after the Closing, and
after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
assuming that the Assumptions are correct and assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions to Closing set forth herein. Buyer and its Subsidiaries (a) will
be solvent (in that both the fair value of its assets will not be less
than the sum of its debts and that the present fair saleable value of its
assets will not be less than the amount required to pay its probable
liabilities on its debts as they become absolute and matured), (b) will have
adequate capital and liquidity with which to engage in its business and (c)
will not have incurred and will not incur debts beyond its ability to pay as
they become absolute and matured. "Assumptions" means (i) that the
representations and warranties of the Seller contained in this Agreement are
true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing and (ii) each
Company has materially complied with and materially performed its obligations
under this Agreement.

Seller expressly agrees that a breach of the representations and warranties
set forth in Sections 4.05(a), 4.05(b) and 4.05(c) shall not result in a
failure of a condition precedent set forth in Section 8.01(c)(i) if,
notwithstanding such breach, Buyer is willing and able to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby on the terms otherwise contemplated hereby on
the Closing Date.

  



  

(f)  Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the consummation of the Financing shall
not be a condition to any obligations of Buyer hereunder, including the
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 4.06.   _Purchase for Investment_. Buyer is purchasing the Shares
for investment for its own account and not with a view to, or for sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof. Buyer (either alone or together
with its advisors) has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters so as to be capable of

  



    

35

 

    

evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Shares and is
capable of bearing the economic risks of such investment.

  



  

Section 4.07.   _Litigation_. Buyer is not a claimant or defendant in or
otherwise a party to any Action concerning its business, which are in
progress or, to Buyer's knowledge, threatened or pending by or against or
concerning its business that would reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to materially impair Buyer's ability to perform or comply
with its obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 4.08.   _Finders ' Fees_. Except for Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.
(the fees and expenses of which will be borne in full by Buyer), there is no

by or is authorized to act on behalf of Buyer who might be entitled to any
fee or commission from any Person in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 4.09.   _Inspections; No Other Representations_. Buyer is an
informed and sophisticated purchaser, and has engaged expert advisors,

acquisition of the Shares as contemplated hereunder. Buyer has undertaken
such investigation and has been provided with and has evaluated such documents
and information as it has deemed necessary to enable it to make an informed
and intelligent decision with respect to the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges that Seller has given Buyer
complete and open access to the employees, documents and facilities of the
Business, and Buyer has undertaken prior to the date hereof all investigations
and inquiries and has requested all documents and information as it deems
necessary in connection with entry into this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer agrees to accept the Shares and
the Business in the condition they are in on the Closing Date based upon its
own inspection, examination and determination with respect thereto as to all
matters and without reliance upon any express or implied representations or
warranties of any nature made by Seller or any Company or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, partners, members,
advisors or other representatives, except as specifically and expressly set
forth in Article 3 Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer
acknowledges that none of Seller, any Company or any of their
respective Affiliates makes any representation or warranty with respect to
(i) any projections, estimates or budgets delivered to or made available to
Buyer of future revenues, future results of operations (or any component
thereof), future cash flows or future financial condition (or any component
thereof) of the Business or (ii) any other information or documents made
available to Buyer or its counsel, accountants or advisors with respect to

consummate the Closing or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby
or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the

materially affect, impair or delay the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Article 8 or the consummation of the Closing or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 5.02.   _Certain Filings_. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with
one another (a) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or

approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material
contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (b) in taking such actions or making any
such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith and
seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

of information, applications and other documents and (y) obtaining and
maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations
and other confirmations required to be obtained from any Governmental

consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that:

  



  

(i)  the parties hereto understand and agree that the reasonable
best efforts of Buyer under this __Section 5.03 only shall be deemed to
include taking, and causing its Affiliates to take, all actions necessary or
appropriate to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
Antitrust Laws so as to enable the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements to occur
as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event prior to the End Date),
including:

  



  

(A)  entering into any settlement, undertaking, consent decree,
stipulation or agreement with or required by any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby;

(C)  terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or
obligations of Buyer or its Affiliates (including those of any Company);

of ownership or control with respect to, one or more of the businesses,
product lines or assets of Buyer or its Affiliates (including any
Company) (each of the foregoing described in any of Section 5.03(a)(i)(A)
through (D) a "Regulatory Concession");

any action (including the acquisition by it or any of its Affiliates of any
interest in any Person that derives revenues from products, services or lines
of business similar to the products, services or lines of business of any
Company) if such action would make it more likely that there would arise
any impediments under any Antitrust Laws that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements as promptly as
reasonably practicable or that would result in any delay of the Closing; and

  



  

(ii)  notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Buyer shall control the strategy for obtaining all consents, approvals, or
waivers that may be sought from any Governmental Authority pursuant to this
__Section 5.03, including by directing the timing, nature and substance of
any filings, forms, statements, commitments, submissions and communications
contemplated by or made in accordance with this __Section 5.03, as well as

otherwise, to objections to, or Actions challenging, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that Buyer shall (A)
consult with Seller in advance of any

  



    

41

 

    

material conversation with any such Governmental Authority, to the extent
reasonably practicable and (B) give Seller the opportunity to participate in
such discussions, negotiations or Actions to the extent not prohibited by
Applicable Law.

  



  

(b)  If requested by Buyer, Seller shall cause the Companies to
agree to any Regulatory Concession; _provided_ that (i) none of Seller's
Affiliates shall be required to make any Regulatory Concession and (ii) none

Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of
Buyer and Seller shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event within five
(5) Business Days of the date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
as soon as practicable (including, unless Seller agrees otherwise,
requesting the early termination thereof). All filing fees incurred by Buyer
or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with causing
the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR
Act, shall be borne by Buyer.

  



  

(d)  Subject to Applicable Law relating to the sharing of
information and Section 5.03(a)(ii), each party hereto shall (i) furnish the
other party with copies of all documents (except documents or portions thereof
for which confidential treatment has been requested or given) and
correspondence (A) prepared by or on behalf of such party for any Governmental
Authority and affording the other party opportunity to comment and
participate in responding, where appropriate; and (B) received by or on
behalf of such party from any Governmental Authority, in each case in
connection with any such consent, authorization, order or approval and (ii)
use commercially reasonable efforts to consult with and keep the other party
hereto informed as to the status of such matters. Each of Seller and Buyer
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, take, refrain from taking or
cause to be taken any action (including, for the sake of clarity, any other
acquisition or investment) that it is aware or should reasonably be aware
would have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any
consent, authorization, order or approval of any Governmental Authorities.

  



  

Section 5.04.   _Access_. (a) From the date hereof until the Closing
Date, Seller shall (i) give Buyer, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors

Business as such Persons may reasonably request; and (iii) instruct the
employees, counsel and financial advisors of the Companies to cooperate with
Buyer in its investigation of the Business. Any investigation pursuant to this
Section 5.04 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(A) Seller shall not be required to provide or cause to be provided access to
or disclose or cause to be disclosed information where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege, contravene any
Applicable Law or contravene any confidentiality undertaking; and (B) prior
to the Closing Date, Buyer shall have no right to perform or cause to be
performed any invasive or subsurface investigations of the properties of the
Business, including any sampling or testing of the air, soil, surface water,

Records") for a period of six (6) years; (ii) upon reasonable written notice
and during Working Hours, afford to Seller and its agents reasonable access
to (x) properties, copies of the Pre-Closing Books and Records and (y)
employees and auditors of the business of the Companies, in each case to the
extent necessary to permit Seller to perform or satisfy any legal, accounting
or regulatory obligation relating to any period on or before the Closing Date
or for any other reasonable business purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer shall not be required to provide access or disclose information to the
extent that such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege or contravene any Applicable Law.

  



  

(c)  From the date hereof until the Closing Date, without Seller's
prior written consent, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not
to, contact any customers, vendors or suppliers of, or other third parties

that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  



  

(ii)  any notice or other communication from any Governmental

Buyer).

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a party's
good faith failure to comply with this Section 5.05 shall not provide the
other party hereto the right not to effect the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.06.   _Seller Marks_. (a) Buyer and the Companies shall have no
right, title or interest in or to the "Masco" names and trademarks, any
trademarks or other indicia of origin listed in Section 5.06(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, any stylized variations, logos and designs used in
connection with the foregoing, any variation or derivative of any of the
foregoing, or any names, trademarks, logos or designs confusingly similar to
any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Seller Marks"). Buyer hereby
acknowledges and agrees that neither it nor any of its Affiliates (including,
as of the Closing, the Companies) shall acquire any goodwill, rights or
benefits arising from the Seller Marks and that all such goodwill, rights and
benefits shall inure solely to Seller.

  



  

(b)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller
grants a limited, non-exclusive right to Buyer and the Companies for a period
of one hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing to use the Seller Marks
solely to the extent necessary to allow Buyer and the Companies to market,
distribute and sell the finished products manufactured by the Companies prior
to the Closing Date (it being understood that (i) Buyer and the Companies
shall only utilize labels and packaging, advertising, marketing, sales and
promotional materials to the extent they existed immediately prior to the
Closing Date, and (ii) notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and the Companies
shall neither (A) use any Seller Marks in any manner or for any purpose which
in any way differs from the use of such Seller Marks by Seller or the
Companies immediately prior to the Closing Date, nor (B) manufacture or
produce, or cause or permit any third party to manufacture or produce, any
new labels or packaging, advertising, marketing, sales or
promotional materials incorporating any Seller Marks in any manner).

  



  

(c)  Promptly upon the expiration of the period set forth in
Section 5.06(b), the Companies shall (and Buyer shall cause the Companies to)
(i) cease any and all use of the Seller Marks (ii) destroy and dispose of all
labels and advertising, marketing, sales and promotional materials, in each
case in its possession or subject to its control, bearing any Seller
Marks, and (iii) cause their names to be changed to such other names that do
not include the Seller Marks and make all necessary filings and use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all applicable Governmental
Authorities to change all applications, registrations and filings, including
corporate names, seals and certificates of the Companies such that they will
not include any Seller Marks. From and after the Closing, none of Buyer,
Buyer's Affiliates or any Company shall challenge the ownership, validity
or enforceability of any Seller Marks.

  



  

(d)  Except with respect to the Company Intellectual Property
Rights or as expressly set forth in this Section 5.06, the parties
acknowledge and agree that neither party nor any of its Affiliates grants any
license or other right, title or interest in or to any

  



    

44

 

    

of its or its Affiliates' Intellectual Property Rights to the other party
under this Agreement, whether by implication, estoppel, exhaustion or
otherwise, and each party retains and reserves all rights with respect to its
and its Affiliates' Intellectual Property Rights not expressly granted under
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement does not, and shall
not, convey, transfer or assign any right, title or interest in or to any
Intellectual Property Rights of any third party.

  



  

Section 5.07.   _Public Announcements_. No party hereto, and none of
their respective Affiliates, shall without the prior consultation of the
other party hereto to the extent reasonably practicable, issue any press
release or make any other public announcement relating to this Agreement, the
Transaction Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby, unless such
party determines in good faith, after consultation with legal counsel, that
it is required by Applicable Law to issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other announcement with respect to this Agreement, the
Transaction Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby, in which
event such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide a reasonable
opportunity to the other party to review and comment upon such press release
or other announcement prior to making any such press release or other
announcement; provided, however, that each party hereto and their respective
Affiliates may make statements that are substantially similar to (a) the
joint press release issued by the parties hereto in connection with the
execution of this Agreement or (b) previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made by any party hereto in compliance with
this Section 5.07.

  



  

Section 5.08.   _Intercompany Matters_. Effective as of the Closing,
except (i) for the Transition Services Agreement, (ii) as contemplated by
this Agreement (including any Seller Credit Support that remains outstanding
following the Closing), and (iii) for those arrangements set forth on Section
5.08 or Section 5.11 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, all intercompany
accounts between Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any
Company, on the other hand, shall be settled and paid in full (regardless of
the terms of payment of such intercompany accounts), and all agreements
between Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Company, on
the other hand, shall be terminated, in each case without further liability or
obligation (contingent or otherwise) of any party thereunder.

  



  

Section 5.09.   _Letters of Credit; Other Obligations_. (a) From the date
hereof until no Seller Credit Support remain outstanding (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, if applicable, after the Closing), Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) arrange for substitute letters of credit,
guarantees and other obligations to replace (A) any letters of credit,
guarantees, financial assurances, surety bonds, performance bonds and other
contractual obligations entered into by or on behalf of Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than solely by (but not on behalf of) the Companies) to the
extent for the benefit of the Business (collectively, together with all
obligations thereunder, the "Seller Credit Support") that are outstanding as
of the date of this Agreement and set forth on Section 5.09(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, and (B) any Seller Credit Support entered into in the
ordinary course of business on or after the date of this Agreement and prior
to the Closing and included in an update to Section 5.09(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule

  



    

45

 

    

that is delivered to Buyer two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date or
(ii) assume all obligations under each Seller Credit Support, obtaining from
the creditor or other counterparty (or, in the case of letters of credit,
bonds or other similar Seller Credit Support, the issuing bank (or similar
entity) thereof) a full release (in a form and substance satisfactory to
Seller) of all parties liable, directly or indirectly, for reimbursement to
the creditor or issuing bank (or similar entity), as applicable, or
fulfillment of other obligations to a counterparty or issuing bank (or similar
entity), as applicable, in connection with amounts drawn or otherwise due and
payable under the Seller Credit Support (including any lenders or other
financing parties participating in such letters of credit, bonds or similar
Seller Credit Support); _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be
required to arrange for substitutions, replacements or assumptions of any
Seller Credit Support effective prior to the Closing Date. Seller and Buyer
will cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement to facilitate the
substitution and replacement of such Seller Credit Support in accordance with
this Section 5.09. To the extent any Seller Credit Support remains outstanding
following the Closing, following the delivery of notice in respect of any
Seller Credit Support, Buyer shall, to the extent arising after the Closing
Date, indemnify and hold harmless Seller against, and reimburse Seller for,
any and all amounts paid, including costs, fees or expenses in connection
with such Seller Credit Support or the associated collateral support,
including Seller's and its Affiliates' fees in maintaining such Seller Credit
Support, whether or not any such Seller Credit Support is drawn upon or
required to be paid or otherwise performed, and shall in any event promptly
reimburse Seller to the extent any Seller Credit Support is drawn upon and
Seller or any of its Affiliates makes any payment, including any reimbursement
of the party issuing or otherwise providing the Seller Credit Support.

  



  

(b)  Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to establish and
duly file replacement compliance bonds, approved by the relevant Governmental
Authority and effective as of the Closing Date, to replace each of the bonds
set forth on Section 5.09(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to the extent
such bonds are for the benefit of the Business ("Seller Bonds"). To the
extent any Seller Bonds remains outstanding following the Closing, Buyer
shall, to the extent arising on or after the Closing, indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates against, and reimburse Seller and its
Affiliates for, any and all amounts paid, including costs, fees or expenses
in connection with such Seller Bond, including Seller's and its
Affiliates' fees in maintaining such Seller Bonds, whether or not there is
any indemnification obligation with respect to a Seller Bond, or required to
be paid or otherwise performed, and shall in any event promptly reimburse
Seller to the extent there is any indemnification obligation with respect to
a Seller Bond, including any reimbursement of the party issuing or otherwise
providing the Seller Bond. Seller and Buyer will cooperate to facilitate the
replacement of the Seller Bonds; _provided_ that such cooperation shall not
require Seller or any of its Affiliates to make any material out-of-pocket
payments, incur any liability, commence any Action or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Buyer shall not (i) enter into any transactions after the Closing in the name
of Seller or any of its Affiliates or that would be covered by a Seller Credit
Support or (ii) amend, modify,

  



    

46

 

    

extend or renegotiate any material term of any obligation that is covered by
a Seller Credit Support in any manner that increases or extends the potential
exposure of Seller or any of its Affiliates under any Seller Credit Support
without providing Seller with evidence reasonably acceptable to Seller that
Seller and its Affiliates have been released from such Seller Credit Support.

  



  

Section 5.10.   _Directors and Officers_. (a) For a period of six (6)
years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Companies to maintain in
effect and continue to provide to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable
Law all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation and
other limitations on liability currently existing in favor of any current or
former Representative of each Company (including any predecessors thereof)
(collectively, such Representatives, the "Seller Indemnitees") under, and in
no event on terms less favorable than those contained in, the organizational
documents of any Company in effect on the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(b)  At or prior to the Closing, Buyer shall purchase or cause to
be purchased a non-cancellable extension of the directors' and officers'
liability coverage of the Seller's existing directors' and officers' insurance
policies for the Seller Indemnitees and the Seller's existing fiduciary
liability insurance policies for the Seller Indemnitees (collectively, the
"DandO Tail Policy"), which shall (i) be for a claims reporting or discovery
period of at least six (6) years from and after the Closing with respect to
any claim related to any period or time at or prior to the Closing, (ii) be
from the Seller's current insurance carrier with respect to such coverage or
an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating and (iii) have
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less
favorable than the coverage provided under the Seller's existing insurance
coverage for the Seller Indemnitees with respect to any actual or alleged
error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of
duty or any matter claimed against the beneficiaries thereof by reason of
their having served in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to
the Closing (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ that (x) in no event shall Buyer
be required to expend for the DandO Tail Policy an aggregate premium amount in
excess of 300% of the premium amount per annum for the Seller's existing
insurance coverage for the Seller Indemnitees and (y) if the aggregate premium
amount for the DandO Tail Policy exceeds such amount, Buyer shall be obligated
to obtain a DandO Tail Policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect
to matters occurring prior to the Closing, for a cost not exceeding such
amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as an alternative to the foregoing and
at Buyer's request and at Buyer's expense (including the costs of filing a
claim and any deductibles, premium increases, Taxes or other amounts that are
or become payable by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller as a result of
Seller's accommodation of Buyer's request), Seller shall make commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the officers and directors of the Companies
serving prior to the Closing to remain covered for not less than six (6) years
after the Closing Date under the Seller Insurance Policies providing
directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance with respect to matters arising at or before the Closing, including
(to the extent such coverage is permitted thereunder) the transactions
contemplated herein.

  



    

47

 

    

(c)  In the event that Buyer, any Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority
of its properties and assets to any Person, then in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer, any such
Company, as the case may be, shall succeed to and be bound by the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.

  



  

(d)  The obligations of Buyer under this Section 5.10 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to materially and adversely affect
any Seller Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.10 applies without the written
consent of such affected Seller Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that
each Seller Indemnitee shall be a third party beneficiary of this Section
5.10).

  



  

Section 5.11.   _Assignment of Contracts and Rights_. (a) Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement that may be deemed to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Shared Contract or any claim
or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if such
assignment, without the consent of a third party thereto, would constitute a
breach or other contravention of such Shared Contract or in any way adversely
affect the rights of Seller, any Company or any of their respective
Affiliates thereunder. If such consent is not obtained, Seller and Buyer
will, until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, cooperate in a
mutually agreeable arrangement under which Buyer would obtain the benefits and
assume the obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement,
including sub-contracting, sub-licensing, or sub-leasing to Buyer, or under
which Seller would enforce for the benefit of Buyer, with Buyer assuming
Seller's obligations, any and all rights of Seller against a third party
thereto, and during such period, Seller shall not amend, modify or waive any
Shared Contract in any manner that would, by its terms, have a materially and
disproportionately adverse impact on the Companies relative to the impact on
Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Companies) without obtaining the
prior written consent of Buyer. In connection with any Shared Contract that is
(x) assigned, in whole or in part, to Buyer, any Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, or (y) sub-contracted, sub-licensed or sub-leased or
under which Seller or any of its Affiliates otherwise passes along any
benefits thereunder, in each case whether in whole or in part, to Buyer, any
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (i) Buyer hereby agrees to
perform, and to cause to be performed, all of the Company's or Subsidiary's
(as applicable) obligations thereunder (the "Buyer Shared Contract
Obligations") and Seller hereby agrees to perform, and to cause to be
performed, all of its and its Affiliates' obligations thereunder (the "Seller
Shared Contract Obligations"), (ii) Buyer shall indemnify Seller and
its Affiliates, and otherwise hold them harmless from, any Damages arising
from its failure to perform any of the Buyer Shared Contract Obligations and
(iii) Seller shall indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates, and otherwise hold them
harmless from, any Damages arising from any failure to perform any of the
Seller Shared Contract Obligations. Any amounts payable under a Shared
Contract that are not directly attributable to either Seller and its
respective Affiliates (other than the Companies), on the one hand, or the
Companies, on the other, will be allocated among them on a fair and equitable
basis consistent with the applicable practices prior to the Closing.

  



    

48

 

    

(b)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement that may be deemed
to the contrary, (i) neither Seller, Buyer nor any of their respective
Affiliates or Subsidiaries shall be required to expend money, incur any
liability, commence any litigation or offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any third party to obtain any such consent to
assign a Shared Contract, (ii) the assignment of any Shared Contract shall
not be a condition to the obligation of the parties hereto to consummate
this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, and (iii) in no event shall Buyer be entitled
to assert that a breach of this Section 5.11 shall have given rise to a
failure of the condition set forth in Section 8.01(b)(ii).

  



  

Section 5.12.   _Insurance Coverage_. (a) From and after the Closing, the
Business shall cease to be insured by, entitled to any benefits or coverage
under or entitled to seek benefits or coverage from or under any of Seller's
and its Affiliates' insurance policies or by any of their respective matching
deductible policies, other than with respect to: (i) any Pre-Closing
Occurrences pending at the time of Closing or brought within a three-year
period concluding on the third anniversary of the Closing Date, solely under
the insurance policies listed on Section 5.12(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule (collectively, the "Available Insurance Policies") or (ii) any Pre-
Closing Occurrences that are properly reported under the Available Insurance
Policies prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that such claims under the
Available Insurance Policies shall be subject to the terms, conditions and
limitations of the relevant Available Insurance Policy and this Agreement,
except to the extent otherwise mandated by Applicable Law. After Closing,
none of the Companies shall make any claim against any insurance policies of
Seller or any of its Affiliates, other than the Available Insurance Policies;
_provided_ that, if any claim for a Pre-Closing Occurrence is tendered to an
insurer under an Available Insurance Policy in accordance with this Section
5.12, and the insurer denies such claim on the basis that it has not been
tendered to the insurers under any underlying insurance policy or to any
matching deductible policy or other self-insurance policy or program of Seller
or any of its Affiliates that is not an Available Insurance Policy
("Underlying Insurance Policy"), Seller shall assist and cooperate with the
Companies in the Companiesʼ tendering of claims to the insurers under such
Underlying Insurance Policies, at Buyerʼs cost; _provided_ ,  _further_ ,
that such tendering or assistance shall not result in any Company receiving
payment with respect to such Underlying Insurance Policy, nor shall the
provisions of this Section 5.12 limit or in any way modify the Assignment and
Assumption Agreement. In all cases, after the Closing the Companies shall be
solely responsible for any applicable deductibles, premium increases, Taxes
or other amounts that are or become payable by Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller as a result of the Companies' use of any of the Available Insurance
Policies. Buyer shall procure all contractual and statutorily obligated
insurance for the Business as of Closing. The term "Pre-Closing Occurrences"
shall mean any claim, accident, occurrence, loss or material unresolved
dispute exclusively related to the Business that occurred or existed or is
alleged to have occurred or existed prior to the Closing Date (to the extent
the damages, losses and liabilities with respect to such claim, occurrence or
loss were not taken into account in connection with the Purchase Price
adjustment under Section 2.06 and do not relate to the Retained Litigation).
For the sake of clarity, the Available Insurance Policies shall not include
any matching deductible policies or other self-insurance policies or programs
of Seller or any of its Affiliates.

  



    

49

 

    

(b)  From and after the Closing, (x) Seller will be responsible for
the Claims Administration with respect to claims of Seller under the
Available Insurance Policies and (y) the Business and Buyer will be
responsible for the Claims Administration with respect to claims of the
Business under the Available Insurance Policies. Any claims for Pre-Closing
Occurrences under the Available Insurance Policies are subject to and
conditioned upon the following:

  



  

(i)  The Business or Buyer shall be solely responsible for
notifying any and all insurance companies of such Pre-Closing Occurrences and
complying with all policy terms and conditions for pursuit and collection of
such Pre-Closing Occurrences, and the Business and Buyer shall promptly
notify Seller's corporate insurance department of any such claims. Neither the
Business, Buyer nor any of their Affiliates shall, without the written
consent of Seller, amend, modify or waive any rights of Seller or
other insureds under any Available Insurance Policy. Until the three-year
anniversary of the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates
shall, without the written consent of Buyer, amend, modify or waive any rights
of the Companies or their Affiliates under any Available Insurance Policy in
any manner that would, by its terms, have a materially and disproportionately
adverse impact the Companies relative to the impact on Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Companies); _provided_ that for the avoidance of
doubt the foregoing shall not restrict Seller or any of its Affiliates from
amending or otherwise modifying any Available Insurance Policy to give effect
to this __Section 5.12. The Business and Buyer shall exclusively bear and be
liable (and Seller shall have no obligation to repay or reimburse the
Business, Buyer or any of their Affiliates) for all uninsured, uncovered,
unavailable or uncollectible amounts relating to or associated with all such
Pre-Closing Occurrences;

  



  

(ii)  With respect to claims for Pre-Closing Occurrences, each
party hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates or third
party administrator to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
benefit of the Available Insurance Policies and pay such benefit, if any, to
Buyer (net of any Recovery Costs incurred by Seller or its Affiliates as a
result of the same); _provided_ that Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller
promptly upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses
incurred by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller in connection with making or
pursuing any claim pursuant to this __Section 5.12, including the costs of
filing a claim and any deductibles, premium increases, Taxes or other amounts
that are or become payable by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller as a result
of claims made pursuant to this __Section 5.12 (such costs and
expenses referred to in this clause __(ii) "Recovery Costs"). The parties
agree that any recoveries under the Available Insurance Policies pursuant to
this __Section 5.12 shall inure first to Seller to reimburse any and all
Recovery Costs that have not already been reimbursed; and

  



  

(iii) Each party hereto agrees to provide, and cause its Affiliates
to provide, reasonable assistance to, and cooperate with, such other party or
its Affiliates with respect to the Claims Administration referred to in the
first sentence of this __Section 5.12(b). None of Buyer, Seller and their
respective

  



    

50

 

    

Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees
shall have any liability, whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or
otherwise, to any Person for or in connection with the provision of such
assistance or cooperation. All reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
either party or its Affiliates in providing any such assistance or cooperation
shall be reimbursed promptly by the other party or its Affiliates.

  



  

Section 5.13.   _Retained Litigation_. (a) From and after the Closing,
Buyer agrees that Seller shall have the sole right to claim and collect any
amounts with respect to the Retained Litigation, and the sole right to
administer, control, settle and resolve the Retained Litigation. Buyer, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including the Companies) (i) agrees that
it shall not take, and shall cause its Affiliates not to take, any action or
make any admissions with respect to the Retained Litigation without Seller's
prior written consent and (ii) shall promptly pay to Seller any amounts
(whether by award of damages or costs, settlement, insurance or otherwise)
that Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Companies), may receive with
respect to the Retained Litigation. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take all steps necessary,
including executing any assignment or other agreement in a form and substance
satisfactory to Seller, to assign any right, property or asset related to the
Retained Litigation to Seller or one of its Affiliates, as designated by
Seller. "Retained Litigation" means any claim of the Companies with respect
to _In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust
Litigation_ , MDL 1720 (MKB) (JO) and any related settlements.

  



  

(b)  Without limiting the generality of Section 5.04(b), after the
Closing, Buyer, at Seller's expense, shall cooperate with Seller and its
Affiliates in the prosecution of the Retained Litigation, including by (i)
making available to Seller and its Affiliates all witnesses, pertinent
records, materials and information in Buyer's, the Companies' or
their respective Affiliates' possession or control relating thereto as
requested by Seller or its Affiliates; including by making the Company
Employees available at reasonable times to provide information, discovery
documentation, take depositions and testify and (ii) otherwise providing any
assistance reasonably requested by Seller or its Affiliates relating to the
Retained Litigation. Each of Seller and Buyer shall take all reasonable
precautions so as not to jeopardize any privilege reasonably available to
Seller or any of its Affiliates. At Seller's request, Buyer shall enter into
a common interest agreement with Seller and its Affiliates with respect to
the Retained Litigation, in a form to be mutually agreed by the parties
hereto.

  



  

(c)  Following the Closing, Seller shall control the defense of any
ongoing audits referred to on Section 3.12 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
_provided_ that Seller shall not settle or otherwise compromise any audit that
could give rise to aggregate liabilities of the Target Company or any
Subsidiary as a result of the matters disclosed on Section 3.12 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule in excess of $200,000 without Buyer's consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

Section 5.14.   _Financing_. (a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to (and shall cause its Affiliates and its and its
Affiliates' Representatives to use their respective

  



    

51

 

    

reasonable best efforts to) take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
arrange, consummate and obtain the Financing on a timely basis on the terms
and conditions described in the Commitment Letter at or prior to the Closing,
including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect and
comply with its obligations under the Commitment Letter in accordance with
the terms and conditions thereof (subject to Buyer's right to amend,
restate, amend and restate, modify, supplement and/or waive the Commitment
Letter and the related definitive debt agreements in accordance herewith),

Letter as in effect on the date hereof and disclosed to Seller, (ii) promptly
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements and documents with respect to
the Financing (the "Debt Financing Agreements") on the terms and conditions

or prior to the Closing.

  



  

(b)  Buyer shall not (A) agree to or permit any amendment,
restatement, amendment and restatement, supplement or other modification of,

replace other debt or equity financing for all or any portion of the
Financing from the same or Alternative Financing sources, in each case,
without Seller's prior written consent, except Buyer shall have the right to
amend, restate, amend and restate, supplement, modify or waive the Commitment
Letter from time to time between the date hereof and Closing (x) solely to
add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or any person
with similar roles or titles that have not executed the Commitment Letter as
of the date hereof or (y) in any other manner, in each case to the extent
such amendment, restatement, amendment and restatement, supplement,
modification or waiver would not have the effect of (i) reducing the
aggregate amount of the Financing under the Commitment Letter (except to the
extent any other portion of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter is increased by a like amount) to an aggregate principal (and net cash
proceeds) amount less than the Required Amount, (ii) imposing new or
additional conditions to the receipt of the Financing or otherwise adversely

transactions contemplated by this Agreement or enforce its rights against the
other parties to the Commitment Letter. Upon any amendment, restatement,

the Commitment Letter (after taking into account any "flex" terms), Buyer
shall as promptly as reasonably practicable notify Seller thereof and use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, and to negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to, alternative debt financing from
alternative sources (the "Alternative Financing") (x) as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event (and in any
event on or prior to the date on which the Closing should have occurred

of immediately available funds) to pay the Required Amount. If any
Alternative Financing is obtained in accordance with this Section 5.14(c),
Buyer shall promptly notify Seller thereof and references to the "Financing"

Companies to, use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Buyer to
the extent necessary and customary (and reasonably requested by Buyer) in

Financing other than a bond financing), including using reasonable best

the extent that it would (1) require Seller to waive or amend any terms of
this Agreement or require Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the

expected to result in material harm to Seller, any of its Affiliates or any
Company, (5) require Seller, any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries (other than

to be satisfied by the End Date, (B) no action, liability or obligation of
the Companies or their respective directors, managers, officers, general
or limited partners, employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors, agents
and other authorized representatives under any certificate, agreement,
arrangement, document or instrument relating to the Financing shall be
effective until the Closing and (C) the parties hereto agree that any
information with respect to the prospects and plans for the Companies'
business and operations in connection with the Financing will be the sole
responsibility of Buyer, and none of Seller, any of its Affiliates, the
Companies or their directors, managers, officers, general or limited
partners, employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors, agents and other
authorized representatives shall have any liability or incur any damages with

Closing, the Companies, shall have any responsibility for, or incur any
liability to any Person (x) under or with respect to the Financing or (y) any
cooperation provided pursuant to this Section 5.14, except for Actual Fraud (

relating to the actions and cooperation contemplated by Section 5.14(d))) or
any information provided in connection therewith;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that such damages resulted
from the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of Seller, its
Affiliates, the Companies or their respective pre-Closing
directors, managers, officers, employees, agents, other authorized
representatives and professional advisors.

  



  

(f)  Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall give Seller prompt notice

55

 

    

(h)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is
understood and agreed that (A) the condition precedent set forth in Section
8.01(b)(ii) as applied to Sellers' obligations under this Section 5.14
shall be deemed to be satisfied and (B) Seller shall be entitled to exercise
each of the termination rights applicable to it in Article 10 hereof (subject
to the terms and conditions thereof), in each case, notwithstanding any breach
of this Section 5.14 by Seller, unless the Financing has not been obtained as
a direct and primary result of Seller's material breach of its obligations
under this Section 5.14. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that obtaining the
Financing is not a condition to Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Seller expressly agrees that a breach of
Section 5.14(a), 5.14(b), 5.14(c) and 5.14(f) by Buyer shall not result in a
failure of the condition precedent set forth in Section 8.01(c)(ii) if,
notwithstanding such breach, Buyer is willing and able to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby on the terms otherwise contemplated hereby on
the Closing Date.

  



  

(i)  All information regarding Seller, the Companies or any of
their respective Affiliates made available to Buyer pursuant to this Section
5.14 shall be kept confidential by Buyer in accordance with the

Agreement in accordance with its terms, Seller shall not, nor shall it permit
any of its Affiliates to, engage in any discussions or negotiations with,
provide any information to, or enter into any contract with, any Person (other
than Buyer and Buyer's representatives) concerning any direct sale, transfer
or other disposition of the Company Securities, any merger involving any
Company, any sale of a material portion of the business or assets of any
Company, any recapitalization of any Company (other than sales of inventory
sold in the ordinary course of business).

  



  

Section 5.16.   _Additional Deliverables_. At or after Closing, Seller

provide Buyer with (i) the Pre-Closing Books and Records, (ii) written
resignation letters of all directors and officers of each Company, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, (iii) to the extent required
by the terms of any Real Property Lease, a consent or waiver to assignment or
change in control of the Target Company, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer and (iv) such other documents and instruments as Buyer
reasonably may request to evidence completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

Action or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any
third party.

Article 6 
 EMPLOYEE MATTERS

  



  

Section 6.01.   _Continued Employment of Company Employees_. The Company
Employees (including any Company Employee who is not actively working on the
Closing Date as a result of an approved leave of absence), are referred to
collectively herein as the "Continuing Employees." Each Company Employee
shall continue employment with the Company immediately following the Closing.

  



  

Section 6.02.   _Maintenance of Compensation and Benefits_. During the
period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of
the Closing Date, (the "Continuation Period"), Buyer shall (or shall cause its
Affiliates (including the Companies) to) provide each Continuing Employee
(during such Continuing Employee's employment with Buyer and its
Affiliates) (a) an annual base salary or wage rate, as applicable, and
incentive compensation opportunities (including both cash and equity-based
incentives) that in each case is at least equal to the annual base salary or
wage rate, as applicable, and incentive compensation opportunities provided
to such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, (b)
employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
employee benefits provided by Seller or its Affiliates to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and (c) severance
benefits that are no less favorable than would have been provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date in accordance with
the severance guidelines set forth on Section 6.02 of the Seller Disclosure

employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, including for purposes of determining eligibility to participate,
level of benefits, vesting, early retirement eligibility and benefit plan
accruals, to the same extent such service would be recognized by any
of Seller or its applicable Affiliate (including the Companies) under any
similar employee benefit plan immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such credit shall not result in a duplication of benefits and
such credit shall not be provided for purposes of benefit accruals under a
defined benefit pension plan.

  



  

Section 6.04.   _Welfare Plans_. Except as provided in the Transition
Services Agreement, as of the Closing Date, each Continuing Employee shall
cease participation in the health and welfare benefit plans of Seller and the

continue participation in the health and welfare benefit plans maintained by
Buyer and its Affiliates (which, for the avoidance of doubt, after the
Closing shall include any Company Benefit Plans). With respect to any Seller
Welfare Plan that continues to be made available to Continuing Employees after

the Transition Services Agreement). Seller and the Retained Subsidiaries
shall be responsible for providing benefits in respect of claims incurred
under a Seller Welfare Plan for Continuing Employees and their beneficiaries
and dependents prior to the Closing Date. Benefits in respect of all
welfare plan claims incurred by Continuing Employees on or after the Closing
Date which are related to such welfare plans shall be borne by Buyer and its
Affiliates and, to the extent any benefits are provided to Continuing
Employees via the Transition Services Agreement, the full cost (i.e., the
amount of actual claims not funded through an insurance policy or other
funding mechanism which are in excess of contributions and Buyer's pro-rata
share of insurance premiums in respect of any insured claims) shall be
borne by Buyer in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Transition
Services Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.05.   _Pre-Existing Conditions and Co-Payments_. Buyer shall
(or shall cause its Affiliates to) use commercially reasonable efforts to:

  



  

(a)  waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees
(and their eligible dependents) under any health and welfare plans in which
the Continuing Employees are eligible to participate on or after the Closing
Date to the extent that such limitations were waived or met under the
applicable Seller Welfare Plan or health and welfare Company Benefit Plans;
and

  



  

(b)  provide each Continuing Employee with credit for the dollar
amount of all co-payments and deductibles incurred by such Continuing
Employee prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or
maximum out-of-pocket requirements under any health plans in which such
Continuing Employees are eligible to participate on or after the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 6.06.   _Flexible Spending Accounts_. As of the Closing Date, the
account balances of the Continuing Employees of the medical and dependent
care account plans of Seller and the Retained Subsidiaries (each, a "Seller
FSA Plan") shall be transferred to a Section 125 of the Code flexible
spending account plan established or designated by Buyer, and Buyer shall be
responsible for the obligations of the Seller FSA Plan to provide benefits to
the Continuing Employees with respect to such transferred account balances on
or after the Closing Date. Each Continuing Employee shall be permitted to
continue to have payroll deductions made as most recently elected by such
Continuing Employee under the Seller FSA Plan.

  



  

Section 6.07.   _WARN Act_. Buyer shall be solely responsible for and
assume all liabilities for the provision of notice or payment in lieu of
notice and any applicable penalties under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act ("WARN") or any similar Applicable Law arising as a result
of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements. Buyer
hereby indemnifies Seller and its Affiliates against and

  



    

58

 

    

agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all damages, liabilities,
costs and expenses of any kind, character or description incurred or suffered
by Seller or any of their Affiliates with respect to WARN or any similar
Applicable Law arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall provide Buyer a
schedule which shall, as of the Closing Date, set forth a list of each
Company Employee employed by a Company whose employment has been
terminated involuntarily within the prior 90-day period, together with such
former employee's work location.

  



  

Section 6.08.   _Assumed Arrangements_. Buyer shall assume or honor each
of the arrangements or contracts with respect to Company Employees listed on
Section 6.08 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

Section 6.09.   _US Defined Contribution Plans_. With respect to each
Continuing Employee who, as of immediately prior to the Closing Date,
participates in a U.S. defined contribution plan that is intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) of the Code and that is sponsored by Seller or a
Retained Subsidiary (a "Seller DC Plan"), Buyer shall (or shall cause one of
its Affiliates (including the Companies) to), effective as of the Closing
Date, (a) cover such Continuing Employee under a defined contribution plan
that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code and that is
sponsored by Buyer or one of its Affiliates (including the Companies) (a
"Buyer DC Plan") and (b) cause the Buyer DC Plan to accept a
rollover (including with respect to participant loans) elected by a
Continuing Employee in a direct rollover to the Buyer DC Plan. During the
Continuation Period, Buyer shall or shall cause its Affiliates to (i) continue
to make available to and maintain for the benefit of Company Employees, the
Buyer DC Plan (including any profit sharing contribution opportunities) in
accordance with the terms thereof and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee
who participated in the Seller DC Plan with a maximum potential employer
matching contribution that is substantially comparable to the employer
matching contribution provided by Seller or its Affiliates to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that, if such
matching contribution made by Buyer is not substantially comparable, Buyer
shall provide such affected Continuing Employee with a one-time cash
payment equal to the difference (on an after tax basis) between the employer
contribution provided by Buyer and the employer contribution that would have
been provided to similarly situated employees of Seller or its Affiliates
under a Seller DC Plan.

  



  

Section 6.10.   _Pre-Closing Annual Bonuses_. For annual bonuses in
respect of the year in which the Reference Time occurs, each participant in a
Seller Benefit Plan that is an annual cash incentive plan (each, a "Seller
Incentive Plan") shall be eligible to receive a cash bonus (the "Annual
Bonus") in respect of such year in an amount equal to (i) in the event Buyer
elects to continue the applicable Seller Incentive Plan for any Continuing
Employee, a cash bonus amount payable under the applicable Seller Incentive
Plan based on the actual achievement of the applicable performance criteria
for such fiscal year or (ii) in the event Buyer elects for any Continuing
Employee, with respect to the period between the Reference Time and the
remainder of the year in which the Reference Time occurs, to establish new
annual cash incentive programs for such Continuing Employee or provide for
such Continuing Employee to participate in an

  



    

59

 

    

existing Buyer annual cash incentive plan (each, a "Post-Closing Bonus
Plan"), a cash amount equal to the sum of (x) the cash amount payable under
the applicable Seller Incentive Plan based on actual achievement of the
applicable performance criteria for such fiscal year through the Closing
Date, with such amount prorated based on the number of completed days in the
performance year through the Closing Date _plus_ (y) the cash amount payable
under the applicable Post-Closing Bonus Plan in accordance with its terms,
with such amount prorated based on the number of completed days in the
performance year following the Closing Date. Such Seller Incentive Plans
shall be maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company), to the
extent applicable, and such Annual Bonus amounts shall be paid by Buyer or
its Affiliates (including the Company), subject to the terms of the
applicable Seller Incentive Plan and any applicable proration (as provided in
the immediately preceding sentence), less any required withholding Taxes, on
the date that is as soon as administratively practicable following the date on
which the Company would normally pay bonuses. Any portion of an Annual Bonus
payable under a Post-Closing Bonus plan will be paid in accordance with the
terms thereof. Promptly following the end of the year in which the Reference
Time occurs, Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company) shall implement
an annual bonus program covering the remaining portion of the Continuation
Period in accordance with its obligations under Section 6.02.

generality of Section 11.08, nothing in this Article 6, express or implied,

hereto, including any Company Employee, any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, (b) shall establish,
or constitute an amendment, termination or modification of, or an undertaking
to amend, establish, terminate or modify, any benefit plan, program,

reasonably requested by Buyer and its service providers to allow Buyer to
comply with the provisions of this Article 6 and (ii) the employees of the
Companies for purposes of communicating with such Company Employees regarding
Buyer's benefits programs and arrangements and facilitating enrollment
therein.

  



  

Article 7 
 TAX MATTERS

  



  

Section 7.01.   _Buyer Tax Covenants_. Except as required under Section
7.08 hereof, Buyer covenants that it will not cause or permit any Company or
any Affiliate of Buyer to (a) take any action on the Closing Date other than
in the ordinary course of business that could give rise to any Tax liability
or reduce any Tax Asset of Seller or any of its Affiliates or (b) make
or change any Tax election with respect to the Company that

  



    

60

 

    

would be effective on or before the Closing Date, in each case, without the
prior written consent of Seller.

  



  

Section 7.02.   _Tax Returns_. (a) With respect to Tax Returns required
to be filed by or with respect to the Company ("Company Returns"), Seller
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, prepare or cause to be prepared and
file or cause to be filed (i) all Company Returns that do not include any
Post-Closing Tax Period and (ii) all Company Returns that relate to Combined
Taxes. If Buyer is required by Applicable Law to file any Company Return
prepared by Seller, Buyer shall file or cause to be filed any such Company
Return, which shall be provided to Buyer at least five (5) Business Days prior
to the due date for filing such Company Return under Applicable Law (taking
into account any extensions thereof) and no later than two (2) Business Days
prior to the due date for filing such Company Return, Seller shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates to, pay to Buyer an amount equal to any Covered Taxes
shown as due and payable with respect to such Company Return.

  



  

(b)  Except as set forth in Section 7.02(a), Buyer shall prepare or
cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Company Returns. Buyer
shall prepare or cause to be prepared all such Company Returns that relate to
a Straddle Period ("Straddle Period Returns") in a manner consistent with the
past practices of Seller, its Affiliates and the Company, except as required
by Applicable Law. Buyer shall deliver to Seller a draft of any Straddle
Period Return for review by Seller no later than twenty (20) days prior to
the due date for the filing of such Straddle Period Return (taking into
account extensions), and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith with Seller or
its designee to resolve any disagreements prior to the required due date for
filing such Straddle Period Return. If the parties are unable to resolve all
open issues with respect to any such Straddle Period Return, such open issues
shall be referred to the Auditor no later than five (5) days prior to the due
date for filing such Straddle Period Return. No later than two (2) Business
Days prior to the due date for filing any Straddle Period Return, Seller
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, pay to Buyer an amount equal to the
Covered Taxes shown as due and payable with respect to such Straddle Period
Return. If, subsequent to the filing of any Straddle Period Return described
in this paragraph, the Auditor determines that the Straddle Period Return was
filed incorrectly, Buyer shall file an amended Straddle Period Return and
Buyer shall pay to Seller or an Affiliate thereof designated by Seller an
amount equal to all excess Taxes paid by Seller and its Affiliates with
respect to such Straddle Period Return.

  



  

Section 7.03.   _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes incurred in
connection with transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any real property transfer Tax and any similar Tax)
shall be paid by 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller when due. The parties shall
cooperate and share the expenses of preparing and filing all necessary Tax
Returns with respect to all such Taxes.

  



  

Section 7.04.   _Tax Sharing_. Any and all existing Tax Sharing
Agreements between any Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, shall be terminated as of the Closing Date.
After such date none of the Companies, Seller or any Affiliate of Seller
shall have any further rights or liabilities thereunder.

  



    

61

 

    

Section 7.05.   _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. (a) Buyer and Seller shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates (including, in the case of Buyer,
the Companies after the Closing Date) to, cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
preparation and filing of any Tax Return or the conduct of any Action with
respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
other party's request) the provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to the preparation of any such Tax Return or the conduct
of any such Action and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Buyer and Seller agree, and agree to cause their
respective Affiliates (including, in the case of Buyer, the Companies after
the Closing Date) to (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Companies until the expiration of any applicable
statute of limitations, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Taxing Authority for all periods required by such
Taxing Authority and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
other party with at least 30 days' prior written notice before destroying any
such books and records, during which period the party receiving the notice
can elect to take possession, at its own expense, of such books and records.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be required to transfer to
Buyer any books, records or information to the extent they relate to Combined
Taxes. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall prepare and provide to
Seller a binder of tax and financial information materials in form and
substance consistent with each Company's historical practices, including,
fixed asset-related data and other schedules and work papers to be used for
financial statement reporting by Seller and to enable Seller to prepare and
file all Tax Returns required to be prepared and filed with respect to the
Companies (or any Tax items of the Companies) in accordance with this
Agreement (the "Tax Binder"). Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to deliver the Tax Binder to Seller no later than ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, _provided_ that, in the event the Closing occurs after November
15, 2019, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the Tax
Binder to Seller no later than February 15, 2020.

  



  

(b)  Buyer and Seller further agree, and agree to cause their
respective Affiliates (including, in the case of Buyer, the Companies after
the Closing Date), to, upon request, use all reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or customer of
any Company or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).

  



  

Section 7.06.   _Tax Allocation_. Annex B attached hereto sets forth an
allocation of the Purchase Price for U.S. federal income tax purposes among
the assets of the Company (the "Closing Tax Allocation Statement"). No later
than sixty (60) days after the date on which the Final Closing Statement
becomes conclusive, Seller shall deliver to Buyer its IRS Form 8883
(or successor or comparable form with respect to the Section 336(e) Election
(as defined below) and any corresponding form under applicable state or local
law) allocating the "aggregate deemed asset disposition price" (as such term
is defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.336-3) among such assets in
accordance with the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 336(e)
(the "Seller Form 8883"). The Seller Form 8883 shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the allocation set

  



    

62

 

    

forth in the Closing Tax Allocation Statement, except for any adjustments to
reflect any adjustment to the Purchase Price made under this Agreement.
Buyer, Seller and each of their respective Affiliates shall file all Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with the Closing Tax Allocation Statement and
the Seller Form 8883 and none of the parties will voluntarily take any
position inconsistent with such statements in any inquiry, assessment, Action
or other similar event relating to Taxes.

  



  

Section 7.07.   _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Any amount paid by Seller or
Buyer under Article 7 or Article 9 shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for income tax purposes to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law.

  



  

Section 7.08.   _Section 336(e) Election_. Buyer, Seller and the Target
Company agree to make a timely election under Code Section 336(e) (and any
corresponding elections under state and local tax law) with respect to the
Target Company (the "Section 336(e) Election"), and to file such election in
accordance with Applicable Law. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing, Buyer, Seller and the Target Company shall execute the Section 336(e)
Election Agreement. Seller (as the common parent of Seller's consolidated
group) will retain a copy of the Section 336(e) Election Agreement. Seller
shall attach to its U.S. consolidated federal income Tax Return for the
taxable year that includes the Closing Date a Section 336(e) Election
statement prepared in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.336-2(h)(5) and (6) (the "Section 336(e) Election Statement") and shall
provide a copy of the Section 336(e) Election Statement to the Target Company
on or before the due date of such Tax Return. Buyer and Seller shall execute
and deliver to each other such documents or forms as each party shall
reasonably request or as are required by Applicable Law to effect the Section
336(e) Election. Seller shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction, or
other Tax item resulting from the Section 336(e) Election on its Tax Returns
to the extent required by Applicable Law. Within 30 days following the
completion of the U.S. federal income Tax Return of the Target Company for the
year that ends on the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay an amount to Seller equal
to the excess, if any, of (x) the Taxes borne by Seller as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this agreement over (y) the amount of Taxes that
would have been borne by Seller with respect to such transactions had the
parties not made the Section 336(e) Election, in each case as reasonably
determined by the parties. Any such payment shall be treated as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price and corresponding changes shall be made to the Closing
Tax Allocation Statement.

  



  

Section 7.09.   _Tax Indemnification_. (a) Seller hereby indemnifies
Buyer for, and agrees to hold Buyer harmless from, any and all Damages to the
extent actually suffered or incurred by Buyer arising out of any Covered Tax
(a "Seller Indemnified Tax Loss"); _provided_ that Seller shall have no
liability for any Seller Indemnified Tax Loss to the extent that such Seller
Indemnified Tax Loss was taken into account as a liability in the
determination of Closing Net Working Capital or Closing Indebtedness.

  



  

(b)  For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of a Straddle
Period, (x) the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income or
receipts of the Company for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined
based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (to the extent reasonably practicable taking

  



    

63

 

    

into account the Company's accounting systems and in a manner consistent with
prior practice of the Company), and (y) the amount of other Taxes (other than
Transfer Taxes) of the Company for a Straddle Period which relate to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

  



  

(c)  If any claim or demand for Taxes that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to a Seller Indemnified Tax Loss is asserted by any
Taxing Authority, Buyer or the Company shall notify Seller of such claim or
demand promptly but not later than the time that would allow Seller to timely
respond to such claim or demand, and shall give Seller such information with
respect thereto as Seller may reasonably request. Seller may discharge, at
any time, its indemnification obligation under this Section 7.09 in respect
of a Seller Indemnified Tax Loss by paying Buyer or the Company, as
applicable, the amount of such Seller Indemnified Tax Loss, calculated on the
date of such payment. Seller may, at its own expense, participate in and, upon
notice to Buyer or the Company, as applicable, assume the defense of any such
Action (including any Tax audit). If Seller assumes such defense of any such
Action, Seller shall have the sole discretion as to the conduct of such
defense (including the right to settle such Action except that, if such
settlement will have an adverse effect that is material on Buyer or the
Company, Seller shall only settle such matter with Buyer's prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); _provided_
that if such Action relates to a Straddle Period, Buyer shall have the right
to participate in such defense at its own expense. Whether or not Seller
chooses to defend or prosecute any claim, all of the parties hereto shall
cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.

  



  

Section 7.10.   _Refunds_. Buyer shall promptly pay or cause to be paid
to Seller or an Affiliate thereof designated by Seller all refunds of Taxes
and interest thereon received by Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer (including
the Company) attributable to Taxes paid by Seller, its Affiliates or the
Company with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case net of any
Taxes incurred by Buyer or its Affiliates as a result of receipt of such
refunds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall have no obligation to pay
to Seller any such refunds to the extent reflected in the calculation of
Closing Net Working Capital.

  



  

Section 7.11.   _Survival_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, including Article 9, the covenants and agreements contained in
Article 7 shall survive for the full period of all statutes of limitations
(giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof).

given to the party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to such
time.

  



  

Section 9.02.   _Indemnification_. (a) Effective at and after the
Closing, Seller hereby indemnifies Buyer and its Affiliates against and
agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all Damages actually
suffered by Buyer or any of its Affiliates arising out of any (i)

breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Seller pursuant to
this Agreement (clauses (i) and (ii), collectively the "Seller Breaches").

  



  

(b)  Effective at and after the Closing, Buyer hereby indemnifies

of any Action by any third party ("Third Party Claim") in respect of which
indemnity may be sought under such Section. Such notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail such Third Party Claim and the basis for indemnification
(taking into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party).

Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such
failure shall have adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

(b)  The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of any Third Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth in
this Section 9.03, shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for
such defense, in each case at its own expense.

  



  

(c)  If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the
defense of any Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 9.03, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) before entering into any settlement of such Third
Party Claim, if the settlement does not expressly unconditionally release the
Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from all liabilities and
obligations with

  



    

67

 

    

respect to such Third Party Claim or the settlement imposes injunctive or
other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense
of any Third Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for
such purpose. The fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by
the Indemnified Party.

  



  

(d)  The Indemnified Party shall not admit liability in respect of
any Third Party Claim, nor enter into any settlement of such Third Party
Claim, without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

(e)  Each party shall cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall
furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  



  

Section 9.04.   _Direct Claim Procedures_. In the event an Indemnified
Party has a claim for indemnity under Section 9.02 against an Indemnifying
Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees
to give prompt notice in writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party.
Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such claim and the basis
for indemnification (taking into account the information then available to
the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent such failure shall have adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.
Following such notice, the parties shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a
resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such
dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate court
of jurisdiction determined pursuant to Section 11.11.

  



  

Section 9.05.   _Calculation of Damages_. (a) The amount of any Damages
payable under Section 9.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any (i)
amounts recovered or recoverable by the Indemnified Party under applicable
insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible
therefor and (ii) the amount of any Tax benefit actually realized by the
Indemnified Party as a result of the incurrence of the relevant Damages. If
the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable
insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for
any Damages, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying
Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying
Party for any payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in
connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount
received by the Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.

  



  

(b)  The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 9.02
for any Damages relating to any matter to the extent that (i) such matter has
been taken into account in connection with the Purchase Price adjustment under
Section 2.06, or (ii) there is included in the Financial Statements a
specific liability or reserve relating to such matter.

  



    

68

 

    

(c)  Each Indemnified Party must mitigate in accordance with
Applicable Law any loss for which such Indemnified Party
seeks indemnification under this Agreement. If such Indemnified Party
mitigates its loss after the Indemnifying Party has paid the
Indemnified Party under any indemnification provision of this Agreement in
respect of that loss, the Indemnified Party must notify the
Indemnifying Party and pay to the Indemnifying Party the extent of the value
of the benefit to the Indemnified Party of that mitigation (less the
Indemnified Party's reasonable costs of mitigation) within two Business Days
after the benefit is received.

  



  

(d)  Each Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to collect
any amounts available under insurance coverage, or from any other Person
alleged to be responsible, for any Damages payable under Section 9.02.

  



  

Section 9.06.   _Assignment of Claims_. If the Indemnified Party receives
any payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
Section 9.02 and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of
such Damages from a third party (a "Potential Contributor") based on the
underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential
Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from
the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment.

  



  

Section 9.07.   _No Right to Set-Off_. Buyer, on its own behalf and on
behalf of its Affiliates (including after Closing, the Companies), hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably waives any rights of set-off, netting, offset,
recoupment, or similar rights that Buyer and its Affiliates have or may have
with respect to the payment of the Purchase Price or any other payments to be
made by Buyer to Seller pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction
Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.08.   _Release_. Seller, on behalf of itself and each of its
Subsidiaries and each of its and their respective past, present and/or future
officers, directors, employees, agents, general or limited partners, managers,
management companies, members, advisors, stockholders, equity holders,
controlling Persons, other Representatives or Affiliates, or any heir,
executor, administrator, successor or assign of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the "Seller Releasing Parties"), and Buyer, on behalf of its
Subsidiaries (including the Companies) and each of its and their respective
past, present and/or future officers, directors, employees, agents, general
or limited partners, managers, management companies, members, advisors,
stockholders, equity holders, controlling Persons, other Representatives or
Affiliates, or any heir, executor, administrator, successor or assign of any
of the foregoing (collectively, the "Buyer Releasing Parties" and, together
with the Seller Releasing Parties, the "Releasing Parties"), in exchange for
the consideration set forth herein, hereby consents to the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement and each other agreement,
document or instrument referred to in or contemplated by this
Agreement. Effective as of the Closing (but only if the Closing actually
occurs), except for any rights or obligations under this Agreement and the
other Transaction Agreements, each of the Releasing Parties hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally releases and forever discharges each of the Released
Parties (as defined below) from and against any and all Actions, executions,
judgments, duties, debts, dues,

  



    

69

 

    

accounts, bonds, Contracts and covenants (whether express or implied), and
claims and demands whatsoever whether in law or in equity (whether based upon
contract, tort or otherwise) which the Releasing Parties may have against each
of the Released Parties, now or in the future, in each case in respect of any
cause, matter or thing relating to the Companies, the Business or any actions
taken or failed to be taken by any of the Released Parties in any capacity
related to Companies or the Business occurring or arising on or prior to the
Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, "Released Parties" means, (x)
with respect to any Seller Releasing Party, each Company, Buyer and its
Affiliates and each of the foregoing's respective past, present or future
officers, directors, employees, agents, general or limited partners, managers,
management companies, members, advisors, stockholders, equity holders,
controlling Persons, other Representatives or Affiliates, or any heir,
executor, administrator, successor or assign of any of the foregoing and (y)
with respect to any Buyer Releasing Party, Seller and its Affiliates
(excluding the Companies) and each of the foregoing's respective past,
present or future officers, directors, employees, agents, general or limited
partners, managers, management companies, members, advisors, stockholders,
equity holders, controlling Persons, other Representatives or Affiliates, or
any heir, executor, administrator, successor or assign of any of the
foregoing.

  



  

Section 9.09.   _Covenant Not to Sue_. From and after the Closing and
notwithstanding any applicable statute of limitations, (a) neither Buyer nor
the Companies shall, and each of Buyer and the Companies shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, bring any Action against Seller or its Affiliates,
whether at law or in equity, with respect to any of the rights or claims
waived and released by Buyer and the Companies (on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates) hereunder and (b) Seller shall, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates not to, bring any Action against Buyer or the Companies
or their Affiliates, whether at law or in equity, with respect to any of the
rights or claims waived and released by Seller (on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates) hereunder.

  



  

Section 9.10.   _Exclusivity_. (a) Except as set forth in the last
sentence of this Section 9.10(a) or in the case of Actual Fraud, and
effective as of the Closing, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Releasing
Parties, waives any rights and claims Buyer or any of its Releasing Parties
may have against Seller or any Releasing Party of Seller, whether in law or in
equity, relating to the Shares, the Business, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. The rights and claims waived by Buyer
and its Affiliates include claims for contribution or other rights of
recovery arising out of or relating to any Environmental Laws, claims for
breach of contract, breach of representation or warranty, negligent
misrepresentation and all other claims for breach of duty. After the Closing,
Sections 9.02 and 11.13 will provide the exclusive remedy for any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or other agreement or other
claim arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(other than claims with respect to the determination of the Adjustment Amount,
which shall be resolved in accordance with Section 2.06).

  



  

(b)  For purposes of this Agreement, "Actual Fraud" means the
making by a party hereto, to another party hereto, of an express
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement by the first such
party; _provided_ , that at the time such representation or

  



    

70

 

    

warranty was made by such party, (i) such representation or warranty was
inaccurate, (ii) such party had actual knowledge (meaning without imputed or
constructive knowledge, and without any duty of inquiry or investigation) that
such representation or warranty was inaccurate, (iii) in making such
representation or warranty the Person(s) with knowledge of the inaccuracy
thereof had the intent to deceive such other party and to induce such other
party to enter into this Agreement, and (iv) such other party acted in
reasonable reliance on such representation or warranty and suffered damages
as a result of such reliance. For the sake of clarity, any Actual Fraud claim
brought against Seller shall require proving each of the elements set forth in
clauses (i) through (iv) of the foregoing sentence with respect to Seller,
and Seller shall not be responsible for the Actual Fraud of any other
Person. For the avoidance of doubt, "Actual Fraud" does not include equitable
fraud, promissory fraud, unfair dealings fraud, or any torts (including
fraud) based on negligence or recklessness.

  



  

Section 9.11.   _R andW Insurance Policy_. Buyer agrees that if Buyer or
any of its Affiliates obtains or binds a representations and warranties
insurance policy with respect to any of the representations or warranties set
forth in Article 3 of this Agreement (each, a "RandW Insurance Policy"), each
such RandW Insurance Policy shall at all times provide that:

  



  

(a)  the insurer shall have no, and shall waive and not pursue any
and all, subrogation rights against Seller or any of its Affiliates, except
for Actual Fraud by Seller;

  



  

(b)  Seller is a third party beneficiary of such waiver; and

  



  

(c)  Buyer shall have no obligation to pursue any claim against
Seller in connection with any damage, loss, liability or expense.

  



  

Section 9.12.   _Materiality_. For purposes of determining whether there
has been any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty
contained herein for purposes of this Article 9, and for purposes of
determining the amount of Damages resulting therefrom pursuant to this
Article 9, any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other similar
qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to such representation or
warranty shall be disregarded.

  



  

Article 10

End Date to June 25, 2020; _provided, further_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this __Section 10.01(a)(ii) shall not be available
to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement results in the
failure of the Closing to have occurred by such time;

  



  

(iii)  by either Seller or Buyer if the Closing would violate any
non-appealable, final injunction or order of any court of
competent jurisdiction, in the United States;

  



  

(iv)  by Buyer if there is any material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Seller
set forth in this Agreement, such that the conditions specified in __Section
8.01(b)(i) or __Section 8.01(b)(ii) would not be satisfied at the Closing (a
"Terminating Seller Breach"), except that, if such Terminating Seller Breach
is curable by Seller, then, for a period of up to 30 days after receipt by
Seller of notice from Buyer of such breach (the "Seller Cure Period") such
termination shall not be effective and the End Date shall be
automatically extended until the first Business Day following the end of the
Seller Cure Period, and such termination shall become effective only if the
Terminating Seller Breach is not cured within the Seller Cure Period;

  



  

(v)  by Seller if there is any material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer
set forth in this Agreement, such that the conditions specified in __Section
8.01(c)(i) or __Section 8.01(c)(ii) would not be satisfied at the Closing (a
"Terminating Buyer Breach"), except that, if any such Terminating Buyer
Breach is curable by Buyer, then, for a period of up to 30 days after receipt
by Buyer of notice from Seller of such breach (the

  



    

72

 

    

"Buyer Cure Period") such termination shall not be effective and the End Date
shall automatically be extended until the first Business Day following the
end of the Buyer Cure Period, and such termination shall become effective only
if the Terminating Buyer Breach is not cured within the Buyer Cure Period; or

  



  

(vi)  by Seller if (1) all of the conditions set forth in Sections
__8.01(a) and __8.01(b) have been satisfied (other than (x) those conditions
which by their terms or nature are to be satisfied at the Closing
(assuming the satisfaction of those conditions at such time if Closing were
to occur at such time) and (y) those conditions the failure of which to be
satisfied is caused by or results from a breach by Buyer of this Agreement),
(2) Seller has given written notice to Buyer that it is ready, willing and
able to take the actions within its control to consummate the Closing and (3)
Buyer has failed to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on or prior to the date on which the Closing should have occurred
pursuant to __Section 2.03.

  



  

(b)  The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.01(a)(ii), 10.01(a)(iii), 10.01(a)(iv), 10.01(a)(v) or
10.01(a)(vi) shall give written notice of such termination to the other
party.

  



  

Section 10.02.   _Effect of Termination_. Except as otherwise set forth in
Section 10.03, if this Agreement is terminated as permitted by Section 10.01,
such termination shall be without liability hereunder of any party (or any
stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or Representative
of such party) to the other party to this Agreement; _provided _ that the
provisions of Sections 1.01 and 5.07, this Section 10.02, Section 10.03 and
Article 11 (other than Section 11.02) shall survive any such termination of
this Agreement;  _provided_ , _further_ , that if such termination shall
result from the willful (i) failure of a party to fulfill a condition to the
performance of the obligations of the other party or (ii) failure to perform a
covenant of this Agreement, such party shall be fully liable, subject to the
provisions and limitations set forth in Section 10.03, for any and all damages
and liabilities of any kind, character or description incurred or suffered by
another party as a result of such failure or breach;  _provided_ , _further_
, that a failure of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
in breach of this Agreement shall be deemed to be willful for all purposes
hereunder whether or not Buyer had sufficient funds available to
consummate such transactions.

  



  

Section 10.03.   _Termination Fee and Related Matters_. (a) If this Agreement
is terminated by Seller pursuant to Section 10.01(a)(iii) (solely in respect
of an injunction or order in respect of matters related to the Antitrust
Laws), Section 10.01(a)(v) (due to Buyer's breach of Section 5.03(a) in
respect of matters related to Antitrust Laws) or Section 10.01(a)(ii), and,
in each case, at the time of such termination, all of the conditions set forth
in Section 8.01(a) (other than (x) the condition set forth in Section
8.01(a)(i) and (y) the condition set forth in Section 8.01(a)(ii) solely in
respect of an injunction or order in respect of matters related to the
Antitrust Laws) and Section 8.01(b) have been satisfied (or in the case of
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, are
capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur on the date of such
termination), then Buyer shall pay to Seller (or an Affiliate designated by
Seller) an

  



    

73

 

    

amount in cash equal to $35,000,000 by wire transfer in immediately available
funds (the "Termination Fee") within two Business Days of such termination
(or, in the case of any such termination by Buyer pursuant to Section
10.01(a)(ii) or Section 10.01(a)(iii), prior to or concurrently with and as a
condition precedent to such termination), it being understood that in no
event shall Buyer be required to pay the Termination Fee more than once. Each
of the parties hereto agrees, on behalf of itself and its respective
Affiliates, that (x) the liabilities and damages that may be incurred or
suffered by Seller in circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable
are uncertain and difficult to ascertain, (y) the Termination Fee
represents a reasonable estimate of probable liabilities and damages incurred
or suffered by Seller in these circumstances and (z) such amount is not
excessive or unreasonably large, given the parties' intent and dealings with
each other, and shall not be argued by any party to be or be construed as a
penalty, and each party expressly waives any right to argue, assert or claim
any of the foregoing in any dispute among the parties and/or any of their
respective Affiliates arising out of this Agreement.

  



  

(b)  In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 10.01(a) and (ii) the Termination Fee is payable under Section
10.03(a), Seller's receipt of the Termination Fee in full shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of Seller against Buyer and its former, current and
future directors, managers, officers, employees, counsel, financial advisors,
auditors, agents, other authorized representatives, stockholders, Affiliates
and assignees (collectively, but excluding Buyer, the "Buyer Related
Parties") and the Financing Parties for any damages suffered as a result of
the failure of the Closing to be consummated or for a breach or failure to
perform hereunder, and neither Buyer nor any Buyer Related Party nor any
Financing Party shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not limit the ability of Seller or the
Companies to recover reimbursement for costs and expenses or interest
pursuant to Section 10.03(c), and any such reimbursement or interest shall
not reduce the amount of the Termination Fee; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that nothing in this Section 10.03(b) shall restrict (x) the availability to
Seller of any remedies in connection with Actual Fraud or any willful breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement, for which all applicable legal and equitable remedies (in
addition to the recovery of the Termination Fee) shall be available to
Seller, or (y) Seller's entitlement to seek and obtain specific performance
as and to the extent permitted by Section 11.13 ( _provided_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt, the remedies referenced in the provisos in this Section
10.03(b) shall in no event be available against any Financing Party).

  



  

(c)  Buyer acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 10.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, Seller would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if Buyer fails promptly to pay any amount due
pursuant to this Section 10.03, it shall also pay any costs and
expenses incurred by Seller in connection with enforcing this Agreement
(including by legal action), together with interest on the amount of such
unpaid fee, costs and expenses, at a rate per annum equal to 8% from the date
such fee, cost or expense was required to be paid to (but excluding) the
payment date.

Section 11.02.   _Seller Disclosure Schedule_. Seller has set forth
information on the Seller Disclosure Schedule in a section thereof that
corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set
forth in one section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule need not be set forth

shall release any liability or obligation of Buyer hereunder or under any of
the Transaction Agreements or expose Seller to any liability (including with
respect to Tax). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer shall
be permitted to collaterally assign its rights and remedies under this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements to any Debt Financing Source
in respect of the Debt Financing, but no such assignment shall relieve any
such assignor of its obligations under this Agreement or any of the
Transaction Agreements or expose Seller to any liability (including with
respect to Tax).

  



  

Section 11.04.   _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements constitute the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and

modification or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the

instrument signed on behalf of such party.

  



  

(c)  No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall impair such right or remedy or operate or
be construed as a waiver or variation thereof or preclude its exercise at any
subsequent time nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right,
power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Except as set forth in
Section 9.11, the rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

  



  

Section 11.06.   _Costs_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid
by the party (including its Affiliates) incurring such cost or expense.

  



  

Section 11.07.   _Severability_. Each term, provision, covenant and
restriction of this Agreement is severable. If any such term,
provision, covenant or restriction is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, (a) it shall have
no effect in that respect and the parties shall use all reasonable efforts to
replace it in that respect with a valid and enforceable substitute term,
provision, covenant or restriction (as applicable), the effect of which is as
close to its intended effect as possible; and (b) the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.

  



  

Section 11.08.   _Third Party Rights_. Except for Section 5.10, Section 9.08
and Section 11.09, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any
rights, benefits, remedies, obligations, or liabilities hereunder upon any
Person, other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Debt Financing Sources shall be
third party beneficiaries of each of the Debt Financing Provisions.

Section 11.09.   _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Nonassertion
of Attorney-Client Privilege_. (a) Buyer waives and will not assert, and
agrees to cause the Companies to waive and not to assert, any conflict of
interest arising out of or relating to the representation, after the Closing,
of Seller, or any shareholder, officer, employee or director of any Company
(any such Person, a "Designated Person") in any matter involving this
Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated thereby,
including any Action between or among Buyer or its Affiliates, any Company and
any Designated Person, by Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP or any other legal
counsel currently representing any Company in connection with this
Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated thereby
(whether or not such legal counsel also represented Seller) (the "Current
Representation"), even though the interests of such Designated Person may be
directly adverse to Buyer or its Affiliates or any Company.

  



  

(b)  It is the intention of the parties hereto that all rights to
any attorney-client privilege applicable to communications between Davis Polk
and Wardwell LLP and any other legal counsel currently representing any Company
in connection with the Current Representation (whether or not such legal
counsel also represented Seller) (the "Attorney-Client Privilege") shall be
retained (or assigned to Seller to the extent necessary) and controlled solely
by Seller (and not any such Company);  _provided_ that the foregoing waiver
and acknowledgement of retention shall not extend to any communication not
involving this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated
thereby. Accordingly, the Companies shall not have access to any such
communications, or to the files of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP or any other
legal counsel currently representing any Company (whether or not such legal
counsel also represented Seller) in connection with the Current
Representation, from and after the Closing. The Attorney-Client Privilege
shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees to take the steps necessary to
ensure that the Attorney-Client Privilege survives Closing and remains in
effect and be assigned to (to the extent necessary) and controlled by Seller.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing,
(i) Seller and its Affiliates shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client
privilege with respect to the Current Representation, and the Companies shall
not be holders thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP or any other legal counsel currently representing any Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Current Representation
(whether or not such legal counsel also represented Seller) constitute
property of a client, only Seller and its Affiliates shall hold such property
rights and (iii) with respect to any privileged attorney-client
communications (the "Privileged Communications") between Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP and any other legal counsel currently representing any Company
in connection with the Current Representation (whether or not such legal
counsel also represented Seller) prior to the Closing Date, Buyer and the
Companies, together with any of their respective Affiliates, successors or
assigns, agree that no such party may use or rely on any of the Privileged
Communications in any action or claim against or involving any of the parties
hereto after the Closing.

  



  

(c)  Buyer agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of each of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Companies), that in the event
of a dispute between Seller or an Affiliate of Seller, on the one hand, and
any Company, on the other hand,

  



    

78

 

    

arising out of or relating to any matter in which Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP
or any other legal counsel currently representing any Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Current Representation jointly represented
both (i) Seller and (ii) any Company, if applicable, neither the attorney-
client privilege, the expectation of client confidence, nor any right to
any other evidentiary privilege or any work product doctrine will protect
against or prevent disclosure by Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP or any other legal
counsel currently representing any Company in connection with the Current
Representation to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller of any information or
documents developed or shared during the course of any such joint
representation.

  



  

(d)  In the event that any third party shall seek to obtain from
Buyer or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, any Company) attorney-
client communications involving Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP or any other legal
counsel currently representing any Company in connection with the Current
Representation, then Buyer shall notify Seller of such application
sufficiently in advance of any hearing on the application to permit Seller to
participate in any such proceedings.

  



  

Section 11.10.   _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, and by each party on separate counterparts.
Each such counterpart shall be an original, with the same effect as if the
signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement
shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto. Until and unless each
party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto,
this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or
obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication). Delivery of a counterpart hereof by e-mail
attachment, facsimile or scanned pages shall be an effective mode of
delivery.

  



  

Section 11.11.   _Jurisdiction_. (a) The parties hereto agree that, except as
set forth in Section 2.06, any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce
any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in
the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within
the State of Delaware (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the
State of Delaware), so long as one of such courts shall have subject matter
jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and that any cause of
action arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen from a
transaction of business in the State of Delaware, and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit,
action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any
party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of
any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service
of process on such party as provided in Section 11.01 shall be deemed
effective service of process on such party.

  



    

79

 

    

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing in Section 11.11(a), each of the
parties agrees that it will not bring or support any suit, action or
proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing Sources in any
way relating to this Agreement or the Transaction Agreements or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including but not limited to any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing or the
performance of the transactions related thereto, in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York located in
the County of New York (and appellate courts thereof), and makes the
agreements, waivers and consents set forth in the immediately preceding
sentences of Section 11.11 mutatis mutandis but with respect to the courts
specified in this sentence of Section 11.11.

  



  

Section 11.12.   _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

  



  

Section 11.13.   _Specific Performance_. (a) The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur, and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law, in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to Section
11.13(b), the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement by any other party, without proof of actual
damages or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which any party is
entitled at law or in equity. Each party agrees to waive any requirement for
the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. The
parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. To
the extent any party hereto brings an action, suit or proceeding to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
(other than an action to enforce specifically any provision that expressly
survives termination of this Agreement), the End Date shall automatically be
extended to (i) the 20th Business Day following the resolution of such
action, suit or proceeding or (ii) such other time period established by the
court presiding over such action, suit or proceeding.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it
is acknowledged and agreed that:

  



  

(i)  Seller shall be entitled to specific performance to cause
Buyer to effect the Closing in accordance with __Section 2.03 and pay any
amounts that may become due at the Closing hereunder only if (w) all of the
conditions set forth in Sections  __8.01(a) and __8.01(b) have been satisfied
or waived by Buyer (other than those conditions that by their terms or nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing and those conditions the failure of which
to be satisfied is caused by or results from a breach by Buyer of this
Agreement), (x) the Financing has been or is reasonably

  



    

80

 

    

expected to be funded at the Closing, (y) Seller has confirmed in writing
that if specific performance is granted and the Financing is funded, then it
is ready, willing and able to take the actions within its control to
consummate the Closing, and (z) Buyer fails to consummate the Closing on or
prior to the date when the Closing should have occurred pursuant to
__Section 2.03; and

  



  

(ii)  Seller shall be entitled to specific performance to cause
Buyer to enforce the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter.

  



  

Section 11.14.   _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
(INCLUDING ANY COUNTERCLAIM) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR IN
ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE
PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED
HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER
IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING ANY ACTION AGAINST THE
DEBT FINANCING SOURCES ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO, THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE FINANCING. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH
HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING SHALL BE DECIDED BY
COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN
ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

  



  

Section 11.15.   _Non-Recourse Against Debt Financing Sources_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
parties hereto hereby agree that no Debt Financing Source shall have any
liability to Seller or any of its Affiliates relating to or arising out of
this Agreement, any of the Transaction Agreements or the Financing (including
any claim for any losses suffered as a result of any breach of this
Agreement, any of the Transaction Agreements or the terms of the Financing),
or any document related thereto (including any willful breach thereof), or
the failure of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby to
be consummated, whether at law or equity, in contract or in tort or
otherwise, and neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall have any rights
or claims whatsoever against any of the Debt Financing Sources under this
Agreement, any of the Transaction Agreements or in connection with the
Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract or in tort, or otherwise.
Seller hereby agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that none of
the Debt Financing Sources shall have any liability or obligations to
Seller or any of its Affiliates relating to this Agreement, any of the
Transaction Agreements or any of the transactions contemplated herein or
therein (including with respect to the Financing). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing herein shall affect the rights of Buyer against the Debt
Financing Sources with respect to the Financing or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or any services thereunder. This Section 11.15 is
intended to benefit and may be enforced by the Debt Financing Sources
and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Seller.
