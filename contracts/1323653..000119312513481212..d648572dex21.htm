ARTICLE I

 

 _The Offer_

1.1. _The Offer_.

(a) _Commencement_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with Article VIII, Merger Sub shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and, in any event, by 5:00 p.m. (New York City Time) on January
6, 2014) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act)
the Offer to purchase for cash all Shares at the Offer Price; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Merger Sub shall not be required to commence the Offer, and
the date referred to in this sentence shall be accordingly extended, if the
Company shall not (i) have (A) provided to Parent on a timely basis all
information reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the preparation
of the Offer Documents or (B) reviewed and provided comments, if any, to
Parent on the Offer Documents on a timely basis or (ii) have given (A) Parent
and its legal counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Schedule 14D-9 prior to the filing thereof with the SEC or (B) due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions and changes suggested
by Parent or its legal counsel, if any, on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC or (iii) be prepared to file with the SEC
immediately following commencement of the Offer, and to disseminate to holders
of Shares, the Schedule 14D-9. The obligations of Merger Sub to accept for
payment and to pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be
subject to only those conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ (the " _Tender
Offer Conditions_ "). The Company agrees that no shares of Common Stock held
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any such shares held on
behalf of third parties) will be tendered pursuant to the Offer.

 

(b) _Amendment or Waiver of Tender Offer Conditions_. Merger Sub expressly
reserves the right from time to time, in its sole discretion, to waive any
Tender Offer Condition or to increase the Offer Price or to make any other
changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Merger Sub shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company, (i) decrease the Offer Price or change the form of consideration
payable in the Offer, (ii) decrease the number of Shares sought to be
purchased in the Offer, (iii) amend, modify or

 



-2-  waive satisfaction of the Minimum Condition, (iv) amend, modify or
supplement any of the other Tender Offer Conditions in a manner that is, or
would reasonably be expected to be, adverse to the Companys stockholders,
(v) impose additional conditions to the Offer, (vi) extend or otherwise change
the Expiration Date in a manner other than pursuant to and in accordance with
this Agreement or (vii) amend, modify or supplement any other term of the
Offer in a manner that is, or would reasonably be expected to be, adverse to
the Companys stockholders.

 

(c) _Offer Documents_. As soon as practicable on the date of commencement of
the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent
and Merger Sub shall (i) file or cause to be filed with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule
TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") and the related offer to purchase,
letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer
documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made
(collectively, and including any supplements or amendments thereto, the "
_Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to
the Companys stockholders as and to the extent required by the applicable
U.S. federal securities Laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder (collectively, the " _Securities Laws_ "). The Company agrees to
furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning the Company required by
the Securities Laws to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Subject to Section
6.2, the Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of
the Company Recommendation. Each party agrees to correct or supplement
promptly any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect or such amendment or supplement shall become necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, and Parent and Merger Sub further agree
to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so amended
or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents, as so
amended or supplemented, to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in
each case, as and to the extent required by the Securities Laws. Unless the
Company Board has effected a Change of Recommendation, Parent will provide
the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents, and any amendments or supplements thereto, before they are filed
with the SEC and disseminated to the Companys stockholders, and Parent shall
give due consideration to all the reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the Company. Parent shall respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC with respect to
the Offer Documents. Unless the Company Board has effected a Change of
Recommendation, Parent will provide copies of such comments to the Company
promptly upon receipt and provide copies of proposed responses to the Company
a reasonable time prior to filing with the SEC and dissemination to the
Companys stockholders to allow for review and prompt comment by the Company,
and Parent shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions
or changes suggested thereto by the Company.

(d) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at midnight (New York City Time) on the twentieth (20th)
business day (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange
Act) following the commencement of the Offer (the initial expiration date, or
such subsequent date to which the expiration of the Offer is extended pursuant
to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_
"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless this Agreement has

 



-3-  been terminated in accordance with Article VIII (and subject to the
Companys and Parents respective rights to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Article VIII), (i) Merger Sub shall extend the Expiration
Date for any period required by the Securities Laws, the interpretations and
positions of the SEC and its staff with respect thereto or the rules and
regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market (the " _NASDAQ_ ") applicable to the
Offer or as may be required by any other Governmental Entity and (ii) subject
to the following proviso, if at any scheduled Expiration Date the Tender Offer
Conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Acceptance Time and
the condition with respect to the delivery of certificates referenced in
clause (6) of _Exhibit A_ ), Merger Sub shall extend the Offer and the
Expiration Date to a date that is not more than ten (10) business days after
such previously scheduled Expiration Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that if,
as of the then scheduled Expiration Date, the sole unsatisfied Tender Offer
Condition (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Acceptance Time and the condition with respect to the
delivery of certificates referenced in clause (6) of _Exhibit A_ ) is
the Minimum Condition, Merger Sub shall (and shall only be permitted to),
unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the Company and Parent,
extend the Offer for a single period equal to the shorter of (A) twenty (20)
business days and (B) the number of business days remaining prior to the
Termination Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that Merger Sub shall not be
required to extend the Offer and the Expiration Date to a date later than the
Termination Date. Merger Sub shall not terminate or withdraw the Offer
without the prior written consent of the Company other than in connection with
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII. In the
event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VIII, Merger Sub shall
promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of such termination) irrevocably
and unconditionally terminate the Offer. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term " _business day_ " means any day other than Saturday, Sunday or any
other day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by Law or
executive order to be closed in New York City.

 

(e) _Subsequent Offering Period_. In the event consummation of the Merger is
precluded by a Statutory Impediment and Parent and Merger Sub collectively
would not own at least 90% of the Shares then outstanding pursuant to the
exercise in full of the Top-Up, Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion,
commence a "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule
14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act and may extend any such subsequent
offering period at any time and from time to time thereafter; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act,
Merger Sub shall immediately accept for payment and promptly (and in any
event within three (3) business days (calculated as set forth in Rule
14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act)) pay for all Shares tendered during any
such subsequent offering period.

 

(f) _Acceptance of and Payment for Shares_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and to the satisfaction or waiver by Merger Sub
of the Tender Offer Conditions as of the Expiration Date in accordance with
Section 1.1(b), Merger Sub shall promptly on or after the Expiration Date
accept for payment (such time of acceptance for payment, the "
_Acceptance Time_ ") and promptly (and in any event within three (3) business
days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act)) pay
for all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to have on a timely basis the funds
necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer.

 



-4- (g) _Notices of Guaranteed Delivery_. For purposes of this Agreement, and the
Offer, including the exercise of the Top-Up, unless otherwise mutually agreed
to by the Company and Merger Sub, any Shares subject to notices of guaranteed
delivery shall be deemed not to be validly tendered into the Offer unless and
until the Shares underlying such notices of guaranteed delivery are delivered
to or on behalf of Merger Sub.

1.2. _Company Actions_.

 

(a) _Schedule 14D-9_. The Company shall file with the SEC as promptly as
practicable on the date on which Parent and Merger Sub file the Offer
Documents with the SEC, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with any amendments or
supplements thereto, and including the exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule
14D-9_"), which shall, subject to Section 6.2, include the Company
Recommendation, and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to its stockholders,
in each case, as and to the extent required by the Securities Laws. The
Schedule 14D-9 shall constitute (and shall contain the information required to
be included in) the Companys notice of appraisal rights in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the
Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub required by the
Securities Laws to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company agrees
promptly to correct the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall
become false or misleading in any material respect (and each of Parent
and Merger Sub, with respect to information supplied by it specifically for
use in the Schedule 14D-9, shall promptly notify the Company of any required
corrections of such information and cooperate with the Company with respect to
correcting such information) and to supplement the information contained in
the Schedule 14D-9 to include any information that shall become necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, and the Company further agrees to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to its stockholders as and to the extent required by the
Securities Laws. Unless the Company Board has effected a Change of
Recommendation, Parent shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments or supplements thereto
before they are filed with the SEC or disseminated to the Companys
stockholders, and the Company shall give due consideration to all the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent. The
Company shall respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments
received from the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 and, unless the
Company Board has effected a Change of Recommendation, shall provide copies
of such comments to Parent promptly upon receipt, shall provide copies of
proposed responses to Parent a reasonable time prior to filing with the SEC
and dissemination to the Companys stockholders to allow for review and
prompt comment by Parent and shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent.

 

(b) _Stockholder Information_. In connection with the Offer, promptly
following the date of this Agreement the Company shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to Parent mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all
of its stockholders of record, a non-objecting beneficial owners list and
security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a
recent date, and shall promptly furnish Parent with such additional
information, including updated lists of stockholders and beneficial owners,
mailing labels, security position listings and computer files, and such other
information and assistance as Parent or its Representatives may

 



-5-  reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the Offer to the record
holders and beneficial owners of Shares. In addition, in connection with the
Offer the Company shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
third parties to, cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub to disseminate the
Offer Documents to the holders of Shares held in or subject to the Stock Plan
and to permit such holders of Shares to tender their Shares into the Offer.
Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall instruct and use their reasonable best
efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, hold in confidence the
information contained in any such labels, listings and files and shall use
such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger. If this
Agreement is terminated, Parent and Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives shall return to the Company (or destroy) all such information.

 

1.3. _Directors of the Company_.

 

(a) _Composition of Company Board and Board Committees_. Promptly upon the
acceptance for payment of, and payment for, a number of Shares by Merger Sub
pursuant to the Offer that represents at least such number of outstanding
Shares as shall satisfy the Minimum Condition, and at all times thereafter,
Parent shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of directors,
rounded up to the next whole number, to the Company Board as will give Parent
representation on the Company Board equal to that number of directors that
equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company Board
(giving effect to the directors appointed or elected pursuant to this
sentence) multiplied by (ii) the percentage that the aggregate number of
Shares beneficially owned by Parent and Merger Sub (including, for purposes of
this Section 1.3(a), such Shares as are accepted for payment and paid for
pursuant to the Offer) bears to the total number of Shares, and promptly
following a request therefor by Parent, the Company shall cause Parents
designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board, including by
increasing the number of directors, seeking and accepting the resignation of
incumbent directors and taking any other actions that are necessary to
accomplish the foregoing. At each such time, the Company shall also cause each
committee of the Company Board (other than the Independent Director
Committee) to include persons designated by Parent representing at least the
same percentage of each such committee, board or governing body as Parents
designees represent on the Company Board (rounding up where appropriate), in
each case to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the rules of NASDAQ.
The Companys obligations under this Section 1.3 shall be subject to
applicable Law, including Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The provisions of this Section 1.3 are in addition to,
and shall not limit, any rights that Parent or Merger Sub may have as a record
holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of Law or otherwise with
respect to the election of directors or otherwise.

(b) _Independent Directors_. In the event that Parents designees are
appointed or elected to the Company Board pursuant to Section 1.3(a), then
until the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable
best efforts to (i) cause at least three members of the Company Board as of
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, who are neither officers of the
Company nor designees, stockholders, Affiliates or associates (within the
meaning of the Securities Laws) of Parent and who will be independent
and eligible to serve on the Companys audit committee for purposes of Rule
10A-3 under the Exchange Act and an "independent director" as defined by Rule
5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules (" _Independent_ ", and such
Independent directors, the " _Independent Directors_ ") to be directors of the
Company and (ii) designate a committee of the Company Board composed solely of
Independent Directors (the " _Independent Director Committee_ ") and to
continue the existence of such Independent Director Committee until the
Effective Time.

 



-6- (c) _Independent Director Approval_. After directors designated by Parent are
elected or appointed to the Company Board pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and
prior to the Effective Time, the approval of the Independent Director
Committee, by a majority vote of its members (or if there are only two
members, by unanimous vote of those two members, or if there is only one
member, by a vote of that member), shall be required for the Company to
authorize (and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, such authorization
shall constitute the authorization of the Company Board and no other action
on the part of the Company Board or the Company, including any action by any
other director, shall be required to authorize) (i) any termination by the
Company of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any amendment by the
Company of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) any extension granted by the Company of
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or actions hereunder
by Parent or Merger Sub, (iv) any waiver of compliance by the Company with any
of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the
Company, the holders of Shares, or election to enforce any of the Companys
rights or remedies under this Agreement or (v) any amendment of the governing
documents of the Company if any such amendment would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the holders of Shares (other than Parent or Merger Sub). The
Independent Directors shall have, and Parent shall cause the Independent
Directors to have, the authority to retain such counsel (which may include
current counsel to the Company or the Company Board) and other advisors
at the expense of the Company as determined by the Independent Director
Committee, and the authority to institute any action on behalf of the Company
to enforce performance of this Agreement (such authority, together with the
matters that require the approval of the Independent Director Committee
described in clauses (i) through (v) being referred to herein collectively as
the " _Independent Director Committee Actions_ ").

 

(d) _Section 14 of the Exchange Act_. The Company shall promptly take all
action necessary pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3,
including mailing to its stockholders an information statement containing the
information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
thereunder, and the Company shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such
information with respect to the Company and its directors and officers as is
required under such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its
obligations under this Section 1.3. Parent and Merger Sub shall supply the
Company with, and be solely responsible for, any information with respect to
itself and its nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates required
by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 to be included in such information statement,
and the Companys obligations under this Section 1.3 shall be conditioned upon
receipt of such information.

 

(e) _Effects on Continued Listing_. Following the Acceptance Time, the Company
shall, upon Parents request, take all action necessary to elect to be
treated as a "controlled company" as defined by NASDAQ Marketplace Rule
5615(c)(1) (or any successor provision) and make all necessary filings and
disclosures associated with such status.

 



-7- 1.4. _The Top-Up_.

 

(a) _Top-Up Grant_. The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable
right (the " _Top-Up_ ") to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer
Price that number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock (the "
_Top-Up Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of shares of Common Stock that,
when issued and added to the number of Shares owned by Parent and its
Affiliates at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one share of Common
Stock more than the number of Shares (the " _Short-Form Threshold_ ")
necessary for Merger Sub to be merged into the Company without a vote or
consent of the Companys stockholders in accordance with Section 253 of the
DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Top-Up be
exercisable (i) unless the parties are precluded by Law or Order from
effecting the Merger pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL (the " _Statutory
Impediment_ "); (ii) to the extent that the number of Top-Up Shares would
exceed the number of the Companys then authorized and unissued shares of
Common Stock that are not otherwise reserved or committed to be issued and
(iii) unless, immediately after such exercise and the issuance of the Top-Up
Shares pursuant thereto, the Short-Form Threshold would be reached (after
giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Shares). The Top-Up shall
terminate concurrently with the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms or if not exercised within the timeframe proscribed in Section
1.4(b) below.

(b) _Exercise of Top-Up_. The Top-Up shall only be exercisable once, in whole
and not in part, prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, within ten (10)
business days following the Acceptance Time. In the event Merger Sub wishes to
exercise the Top-Up, it shall so notify the Company in writing, and shall set
forth in such notice (i) the number of Shares that Merger Sub intends to
purchase pursuant to the exercise of the Top-Up and (ii) the place and time
for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares (the " _Top-Up Closing_
"). Upon request of Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its transfer agent to certify in writing to Merger Sub the number of
Shares as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up. At the Top-Up
Closing, Merger Sub shall cause the Company to be paid the aggregate price
required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares and the Company shall cause to be
issued to Merger Sub a Certificate or Book Entry Share representing the Top-
Up Shares. The purchase price owed by Merger Sub to the Company to purchase
the Top-Up Shares shall be paid to the Company at the Top-Up Closing, at
Merger Subs option, (A) in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds, or (B)
by (x) paying in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds, an amount equal to
not less than the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Shares and (y) executing
and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount
equal to the aggregate purchase price for the Top-Up Shares less the amount
paid in cash pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (x) (the "
_Promissory Note_ "). The Promissory Note (1) shall be due on the first
anniversary of the Top-Up Closing, (2) shall bear simple interest of 5% per
annum, (3) shall be full recourse to Merger Sub, (4) may be prepaid, in whole
or in part, at any time without premium or penalty and (5) shall have no
other material terms.

(c) _Exemption from Registration_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the
Top-Up Shares that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up will
not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), and
will be issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption from registration
under the Securities Act for transactions not involving a public offering.
Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to the Company that Merger
Sub

 



-8-  is, and will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited
investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act.
Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon
exercise of the Top-Up are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the
purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

(d) _No Effect on Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each of
the parties agrees and acknowledges that in any appraisal proceeding under
Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to the Dissenting Shares, the Surviving
Corporation shall not assert that the Top-Up, the Top-Up Shares or any cash
or the Promissory Note delivered to the Company in payment for such Top-Up
Shares should be considered in connection with the determination of the fair
value of the Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.

(e) _Assignment of Top-Up_. Without the prior written consent of the Company,
the right to exercise the Top-Up granted pursuant to this Agreement shall not
be assigned by Merger Sub other than to Parent or a direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent, including by operation of Law or otherwise, and
any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 1.4(e) shall be null
and void.

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations;_

 

 _Exchange Procedures_

4.1.  _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company:

 

(a) _Merger Consideration; Conversion of Securities_. Each Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than (i) Shares
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned

 



-10-  by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties and (ii) Shares
that are owned by stockholders (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ", and together
with the Shares referred to in the immediately preceding clause (i), the "
_Excluded Shares_ ") who have properly demanded and not withdrawn a demand
for, or lost their right to, appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to such Shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall be converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price (the "
_Per Share Merger Consideration_ ") without interest. At the Effective Time,
all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly
representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) and each book
entry account formerly representing any of the non-certificated Shares (other
than Excluded Shares) (a " _Book Entry Share_ ") shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for each such
Share, without interest.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of such Excluded
Share, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and cease to exist.

(c)  _Conversion of Merger Sub Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

4.2. _Paying Agent; Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent reasonably selected by
Parent (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, a
cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to
make payments under Section 4.1(a) (such cash amount being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). If a Dissenting Stockholder
effectively withdraws its demand for, or loses its rights to, appraisal
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any Dissenting Shares,
Parent shall make available or cause to be made available to the Paying Agent
additional funds in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of
Dissenting Shares for which the Dissenting Stockholder has withdrawn
its demand for, or lost its rights to, appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL and (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration. The Paying Agent shall
invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such
investments shall be in (A) obligations of or guaranteed by the United States
of America, (B) in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, (C) in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion or (D) a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no
such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three (3) months. To the
extent there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt cash
payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated
hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund
lost through such investments or other events so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such
cash payments. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
amounts payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly returned to the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with applicable Law and Section 4.2(d).

 



-11- (b) _Exchange Procedures._

 

(i) _Letters of Transmittal_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (A) a
letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Shares shall pass, with
respect to Book Entry Shares only upon adherence to the procedures set forth
in the letter of transmittal, and, with respect to Certificates, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal and
proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent), and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(e))
or Book Entry Shares in exchange for the amount to which such holder of record
is entitled as a result of the Merger pursuant to Section 4.1(a).

 

(ii) _Certificates_. Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal by any holder
of Certificates (other than Excluded Shares), duly completed and duly
executed in accordance with its instructions and the surrender to the Paying
Agent of a Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such Shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as
provided in Section 4.2(e)), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal
to the product of (A) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(e))
and (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates.

(iii) _Book Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive as a result of the Merger pursuant to Section 4.1(a). In lieu
thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book Entry Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents
message" in customary form (it being understood that the holders of Book
Entry Shares shall be deemed to have surrendered such Shares upon receipt by
the Paying Agent of such "agents message" or such other evidence, if any, as
the Paying Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, a cash amount in immediately available
funds (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in
Section 4.2(g)) equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares represented
by such Book Entry Share and (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the
Book Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest
will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Book
Entry Shares.

 



-12- (iv) _Excluded Shares; Unrecorded Transfers_. If any Excluded Shares cease to
be Excluded Shares pursuant to Section 4.2(a), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent as promptly as practicable after such Excluded Shares
cease to be Excluded Shares to mail to the holder of such Shares the letter
of transmittal and instructions referred to in Section 4.2(b)(i), with
respect to such Shares or to take such other action consistent with this
Section 4.2 to ensure that the holder of record of such formerly Excluded
Shares surrenders its Shares and receives payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration to which such holder of record is entitled as a result of the
Merger pursuant to Section 4.1(a) in respect of each such Share. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Certificates or Book Entry Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be
delivered upon compliance with the procedures described in this Section 4.2(b)
may be issued to such transferee if evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Paying Agent is presented that the transfer of any such Certificate or Book
Entry Share has been properly effected, accompanied by such documentation
reasonably requested by the Paying Agent evidencing that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(v) _Special Procedures for DTC_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall reasonably cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying
Agent and The Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") designed to provide that
(i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m. (New York City Time) on
the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the
Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the
product of (A) the number of Shares held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Per Share Merger
Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "), and (ii) if the Closing
occurs after 11:30 a.m. (New York City Time) on the Closing Date, the Paying
Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first (1st) business day
after the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds
equal to the DTC Payment.

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares in the records of the Company. After the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares evidencing ownership of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided for
herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Book Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article IV.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
unclaimed by the holders of Shares for 180 calendar days after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of
Shares who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter
look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the amount to which such
holder is entitled as a result of the Merger pursuant to Section 4.1(a) (after
giving 

 



-13-  effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) upon
due surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such
Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(e)) or Book Entry Shares held by
them, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any Person for any amount delivered to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares at such date as is immediately prior
to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of any claims or interests of any such holders or their successors,
assignees or personal representatives previously entitled thereto. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual,
corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association,
organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or nature.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably required by Parent
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate and (ii) the Per
Share Merger Consideration.

(f) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has properly demanded a demand for
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration with respect to such Dissenting Shares unless and until such
Person shall have effectively withdrawn its demand for, or lost its right to,
appraisal under the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares. Unless and
until a Dissenting Stockholder shall have effectively withdrawn its demand
for, or lost its right to, appraisal under the DGCL with respect to
Dissenting Shares, each Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled only to such
rights and payments as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to
such Dissenting Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder
shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such holders rights under Section
262 of the DGCL, each of such holders Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
deemed an Excluded Share and shall be deemed to have been converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 4.1(a), without interest and after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g), and such holder
thereof shall cease to have any other rights with respect thereto. The Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal,
attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to applicable Laws that are received by the Company relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to all demands for
appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 



-14- (g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, and
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as
the case may be.

4.3. _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Acceptance Time, each outstanding option to
purchase shares of Common Stock (a " _Company Option_ ") under the Stock
Plan, whether vested or unvested, shall automatically vest, and at the
Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of
(i) the total number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Option
and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of Common Stock under such Company Option, which
amount shall be paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time. In the case of a Company
Option with an exercise price that is greater than the Per Share
Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall, at the Effective Time,
automatically be forfeited for no consideration in exchange therefor.

(b)  _Company Restricted Stock._ Immediately prior to the Acceptance Time,
any vesting conditions applicable to any shares of restricted Common Stock
(each such share, a share of " _Company Restricted Stock_ ") granted
pursuant to the Stock Plan shall be deemed to be satisfied (subject to and
contingent upon the occurrence of the Acceptance Time), and such shares of
Company Restricted Stock shall be treated the same as all other Shares in
accordance with Section 4.1 of this Agreement.

(c) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company and
the compensation committee (the " _Compensation Committee_ ") of the Company
Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which
are necessary to effectuate the provisions of Sections 4.3(a) and (b),
including obtaining consents from holders of Company Options and/or Company
Restricted Stock, if and to the extent the Compensation Committee determines
to be necessary.

 

4.4. _Adjustments_. In the event that the Company changes the number of Shares
or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange
offer, or other similar transaction, the Offer Price and the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change and as so
adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Offer Price and
the Per Share Merger Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this Section 4.4 shall be construed to permit the Company, any Subsidiary of
the Company or any other Person to take any action that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" or elsewhere
therein, to the extent they are statements that are predictive, cautionary or

Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that
disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or
subsection to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent), the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

 

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of

and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing
(with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) as
a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its

Subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and by-laws or comparable

Subsidiaries;

 



-16- (ii) " _Affiliate_ " means, when used with respect to any Person, any other
Person who is an "affiliate" of that Person within the meaning of Rule 405

events or occurrences (x) is, or would reasonably be expected to be,
materially adverse to the business, results of operations or financial
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (y)
prevents, or would reasonably be likely to prevent, the Company from

Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and owned by the Company or by a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of

stock, phantom stock rights, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation
rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls,
commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities or
obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any
Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any equity securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations
evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding, other than the

Company of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



-20- (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company does not, and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Company will not constitute
or result in (A) assuming receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if
required by applicable Law, a violation of the certificate of incorporation
or by-laws of the Company, (B) a violation of the comparable governing
documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (C) a breach or violation of, a
termination of, a right of termination or default under, the creation or
acceleration of any obligations under, or the creation of a Lien on any of the

forms, statements, reports and documents required to be filed or furnished by
it with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act since

and documents publicly filed or publicly furnished since the Applicable Date
and those publicly filed or publicly furnished subsequent to the date of this
Agreement, including any amendments thereto, the " _Company Reports_ "). Each

disclosure documents. The Company maintains internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the

providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP in all material respects. The Company has disclosed to
the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board based on
its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement (A)

and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal controls, and the information described in the foregoing
clauses (A) and (B) has been disclosed to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement.

Company has made any prohibited loans to any executive officer of the Company

the Company. There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit
made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any executive officer (as

decree or award of any Governmental Entity applicable to the Company or any of

or any ERISA Affiliate has any obligation or liability, including employment
agreements and the Stock Plan and award

 



-23-  agreements thereunder for the benefit of employees, directors or any other
individual service providers of the Company or its Subsidiaries (without
regard to materiality, the " _Benefit Plans_ "). Benefit Plans maintained
outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of employees working
outside of the United States whether or not statutorily required are referred
to herein as " _Non-U.S. Benefit Plans_ ".

(ii) Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable opinion or determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service, including any master or prototype plan, on which it
may rely, and nothing has occurred that could reasonably be expected to cause
the loss of such qualification or the imposition of any material penalty or
liability related to such Benefit Plan. True, correct and complete copies of

have been made available to Parent.

(iii) All Benefit Plans, other than "multiemployer plans" within the meaning
of Section 3(37) of ERISA (each, a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") and Non-U.S.
Benefit Plans, comply in all material respects in form and have been
maintained in all material respects in accordance with their terms and in
compliance with ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws, including
operational and, since January 1, 2009, documentary compliance with Section
409A of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, any other Person has engaged in a transaction with
respect to any Benefit Plan that has subjected or would reasonably be expected
to subject the Company or any Subsidiary to a material Tax or penalty imposed
by either Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or could
reasonably be expected to incur a material Tax or penalty imposed by Section
4980F of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA or any material liability under
Section 4071 of ERISA. No proceeding, audit or investigation that could
reasonably be expected to result in any material liability has been
asserted, instituted or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against
or in connection with any of the Benefit Plans, other than non-material
routine claims for benefits and appeals of such claims. No Benefit Plan is
under, and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has received
any notice of, an audit or investigation by the Internal Revenue Service,
Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other
Governmental Entity, and no such completed audit or investigation (if any),
has resulted, in the imposition of any material Tax or penalty that remains
outstanding and unsatisfied as of the date hereof. The assets of any Benefit
Plan do not include employer securities or employer real property (as such
terms are defined in Section 407(d) of ERISA).

 



-24- (iv) No liability has been or is expected to be incurred by the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate with respect to any ongoing,
frozen or terminated plan subject to Section 412 of the Code, Section 302 of
ERISA or Title IV of ERISA, including a "single-employer plan", within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly
maintained, participated in, or contributed to by any of them, or the single-
employer plan of any entity that could be considered a single employer with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section
414 of the Code (each, an " _ERISA Affiliate_ "). The Company, its
Subsidiaries and ERISA Affiliates have not incurred and do not expect to incur
any withdrawal liability or any other liability or obligation with respect to
a Multiemployer Plan.

(v) With respect to any Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA: (i) all
contributions required by the minimum funding standards of Sections 412, 430,
431 and 432 of the Code have been made; (ii) no variance from minimum funding
standards (as described in Section 412(c) of the Code) has been requested;
(iii) as of the date of the latest actuarial valuation of such plan, the fair
value of the plan assets of any such plan equals or exceeds the projected
benefit obligation under such plan (whether or not vested, each as determined
under the assumptions and valuation method used in such actuarial valuation);
(iv) no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for
which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived has occurred or is
reasonably expected to occur, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not result in the occurrence of any such
reportable event; (v) there are no demands for material payments,
contributions or security by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, nor has
it instituted proceedings to terminate any such plan and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, no condition exists that presents a risk that such proceedings
will be instituted or which would constitute grounds under Section 4042 of
ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer,
such plan. No material liability or contingent liability (including liability
pursuant to Section 4062(e), 4069, 4212(c) or 4204 of ERISA) under Title IV of
ERISA or Section 430(k) of the Code has been or is reasonably expected to be
incurred by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate.

(vi) All contributions required by applicable Law to be made under each
Benefit Plan, as of the date of this Agreement, have been timely made or
accrued and reflected in the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or
incorporated by reference in the Company Reports prior to the date of this
Agreement, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in
any material liability to the Company or its Subsidiaries.

(vii) No Benefit Plan provides retiree or post-employment health or life
insurance benefits to any current or former director, officer or employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except as required under Section
4980B of the Code, Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or any similar Law (" _COBRA_ ")
for which the covered individual pays the full cost of coverage. Each Benefit
Plan (other than employment or similar contracts 

 



-25-  with individual employees) may be amended or terminated in accordance with
its terms without material liability (other than for benefits accrued through
the date of such action). The Company, its Subsidiaries and the ERISA
Affiliates are and have been in material compliance with the applicable
requirements of COBRA.

 

(viii) Neither the execution of this Agreement by the Company nor the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will (A) entitle any employee, director or other service
providers (whether current, former or retired) of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to any material severance pay or benefits or any
material increase in severance pay or benefits upon any termination of
employment after the date of this Agreement, (B) accelerate the time of
payment, funding or vesting or result in any material payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of any compensation or benefits, or
(C) increase the amount payable or result in any other material obligation, in
each case pursuant to any of the Benefit Plans or as otherwise paid or payable
by the Company.

 

(ix) No amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property) as a result of the consummation of the Offer, the Merger
or other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any employee,
director, other service provider or shareholder of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any Benefit Plan or as otherwise paid or payable by
the Company would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or
would be subject to an excise Tax under Section 4999 of the Code. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any indemnity or gross-up obligation
on or after the Acceptance Time for any Taxes or penalties imposed under
Section 4999 or Section 409A of the Code.

(x) All Non-U.S. Benefit Plans (A) comply in all material respects and have
been maintained in all material respects in accordance with their terms and
applicable local Law, and (B) that are intended to be funded and/or book
reserved are funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate, except, in either
case, as would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in any material

(excluding any benefits required to be provided by statute) are listed on
Section 5.1(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(i) _Compliance with Laws; Licenses_. The businesses of each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries have not been since the Applicable Date, and are not

case, as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has obtained and is in compliance with all permits,
certifications, approvals, registrations, authorizations, franchises,
variances and exemptions issued or granted by a Governmental Entity ("
_Licenses_ ") necessary to conduct its business as presently conducted, except

due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Company, constitutes

connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by

Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially
impair or materially delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other

constitute or result in (A) a violation of the certificate of incorporation
or by-laws of Parent or Merger Sub, (B) a breach or violation of, a
termination of, a right of termination or default under, the creation or
acceleration of any obligations under, or the creation of a Lien on any of

assets are bound, or (C) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in
Section 5.2(c)(i), a violation of any Laws to which Parent or Merger Sub is
subject, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C) of this Section 5.1(c)(ii),
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially impair
or materially delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



-38- (d) _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no Actions
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing against Parent
or Merger Sub by or before any Governmental Entity that seek to enjoin, or
would reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing, making illegal,
or otherwise interfering with, the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, prevent or materially impair or materially delay the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to the provisions of any judgment,
order, writ, injunction, decree or award of any Governmental Entity, except
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially impair
or materially delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(i) The term " _Knowledge of Parent_ " when used in this Agreement with
respect to Parent or Merger Sub shall mean the actual knowledge of those
officers of Parent set forth in Schedule 5.2(d)(i), in each case as of the
date of this Agreement after reasonable inquiry.

 

(e) _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and
complete copies of the debt commitment letter and the related fee letter (of
which only the fee amounts and "flex" terms have been redacted; provided that
no such redacted terms affect conditionality or would result in a reduction in
the cash proceeds available to Parent and/or Merger Sub from the
Debt Financing, the " _Redacted Fee Letter_ "), each dated as of the date
hereof, from the financial institutions (the " _Financing Sources_ ")
identified therein (the " _Debt Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which
the lenders party thereto have committed, subject to the terms and conditions
set forth therein, to lend the amounts set forth therein for the purposes of
financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and related fees
and expenses and the refinancing of certain Indebtedness of the Company (the "
_Debt Financing_ "). None of the Debt Financing Commitments has been amended
or modified prior to the date of this Agreement, no such amendment or
modification is contemplated and, as of the date hereof, the respective
commitments contained in the Debt Financing Commitments have not been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. As of the date of
this Agreement there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or
arrangements related to the funding of the Debt Financing other than the Debt
Financing Commitments delivered to the Company on or prior to the date of this
Agreement. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in
connection with the Debt Financing Commitments that are payable on or prior to
the date of this Agreement and, as of the date hereof, the Debt Financing
Commitments are in full force and effect and are legal, valid, binding and
enforceable obligations of Parent (and, to the extent assigned to Merger Sub
after the date hereof, Merger Sub) and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of
the other parties thereto, in each case subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to
the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than as expressly
set forth in or expressly contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments. As
of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Section 5.1, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of
Parent and/or Merger Sub or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party
thereto under any of the Debt Financing Commitments. As of the date hereof,
assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 5.1, Parent has no reason to believe that (i) any of the conditions to
the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing

 



-39-  Commitments will not be satisfied prior to the expiration thereof and (ii)
any portion of the Debt Financing will not be made available to Parent and/or
Merger Sub at the Acceptance Time. Assuming (A) the Debt Financing
Commitments are funded in accordance with their terms, (B) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.1 and (C) the
performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, Parent
and Merger Sub will have funds sufficient, along with cash on hand, to (1) pay
the Offer Price in respect of each Share tendered and accepted for payment in
the Offer, (2) pay the aggregate consideration to be paid in connection with
the consummation of the Merger, (3) pay any and all fees and expenses required
to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation in connection
with the Offer, the Merger and the Debt Financing (including any fees,
original issue discount or other costs that may be incurred assuming full
exercise of "flex" under the Debt Financing Commitments), (4) pay for any
refinancing of any outstanding Indebtedness of the Company contemplated by
this Agreement or the Debt Financing Commitments and (5) satisfy all of the
other payment obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation
contemplated hereunder.

 

(f) _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub
consists solely of 1000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
which 100 shares are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is owned by Parent or a direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, free and clear of all Liens.
Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior to the date of this Agreement
and has no assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those
as may be incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(g) _Brokers_. No agent, broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the
Offer, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based
upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for which the
Company could have any liability if the Merger is not consummated.

(h) _Solvency_. Assuming (i) the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Section 5.1(e), (ii) the accuracy, in
all material respects, of the financial information provided to Parent by the
Company prior to the date of this Agreement and (iii) the satisfaction of the
conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this agreement and after giving effect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Debt Financing,
any Alternative Financing and the payment of the aggregate Offer Price, the
payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, the payment of all
amounts under Section 4.3 and the payment of all related fees and expenses and
payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately
after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " when used with
respect to any Person means that, as of any date of determination, (i) the
amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of
such date, exceed the sum of (A) the value of all "liabilities of such Person,
including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted
terms are generally determined in accordance with

 



-40-  applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and
(B) the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such
Person, as of such date, on its existing debts (including contingent and
other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (ii) such Person
will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for
the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged following such date, and (iii) such Person will be able to pay its
liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and other liabilities, as
they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, as of such date,
including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means that such
Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset
dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations
as they become due.

 

(i) _Ownership of Shares_. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates
beneficially owns (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) any shares
of capital stock of the Company or other securities of the Company or any
options, warrants or other rights to acquire capital stock of the Company or
any other economic interest (through derivative securities or otherwise) in
the Company, nor have Parent nor Merger Sub taken, authorized or permitted
any Representatives of Parent or Merger Sub to take, any action that would
reasonably be expected to cause, Parent, Merger or any of their "affiliates"
or "associates" to be deemed an "interested stockholder", in each case, as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL or otherwise render Section 251(h) of the
DGCL inapplicable to the Merger.

 

(j) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied by or on behalf
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in writing specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference (i) in the Schedule 14D-9 will at the time filed
with the SEC and at the time first published, sent or given to the Companys
stockholders and (ii) in the Proxy Statement, if any, will at the time it is
first mailed to the Companys stockholders and, if applicable, at the time of
the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, except that no representation or warranty
is made with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein
based on information supplied by or on behalf of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives. At the time filed with the SEC
and at the time first published, sent or given to the Companys stockholders,
the Offer Documents (i) will comply in all material respects with the
Securities Laws and (ii) will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no
representation or warranty is made with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by or on
behalf of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
Representatives.

(k) _No Other Company Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or in any
certificate or other instrument delivered by the Company pursuant to this
Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates, advisors, agents or
other

 



-41-  Representatives, nor any other Person, has made or is making any other
express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective business or operations, including
with respect to any information provided or made available to Parent, Merger
Sub or any other Person in certain "data rooms," confidential information
memoranda or management presentations in anticipation or contemplation of any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.2(k) shall (i) relieve any Person of
liability for fraud or (ii) prevent Parent or Merger Sub from relying on the
representations and warranties of the Company in accordance and to the extent
contemplated by the terms set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate or
other instrument delivered by the Company pursuant to and in accordance
with its terms and the terms set forth in this Agreement.

(l) _Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts, Forward-Looking Statements
and Business Plans_. In connection with the due diligence investigation of
the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub have received and
may continue to receive from the Company certain estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as certain business
plan information, regarding the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
businesses and operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there
are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as well as in such business
plans, and that Parent and Merger Sub are responsible for making their own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such business
plans, so furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-
looking information or business plans). Accordingly, Parent and Merger Sub
hereby acknowledge that none of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor
any of their respective stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
affiliates, advisors, agents or other Representatives, nor any other Person,
has made or is making any representation or warranty with respect to such
estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business
plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business
plans). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.2(l) shall
(i) relieve any Person of liability for fraud or (ii) prevent Parent or
Merger Sub from relying on the representations and warranties of the Company
in accordance with and to the extent contemplated by the terms set forth in
this Agreement or in in accordance with the provisions of any certificate or
other instrument delivered by the Company pursuant the terms of this
Agreement.

reasonably capable of being fully financed and (C) is reasonably expected to
be consummated in accordance with its terms.

therefor to a Person who has made an unsolicited  _bona fide_ written

Proposal does not arise out of or result from any breach of this Section 6.2)
if and only if, prior to providing such information, the Company has received

agreement between the Company and such Person that is no more favorable in any
material respect to the counterparty than the Confidentiality Agreement,
dated October 1, 2013, between the Company and Parent (the " _Company
Confidentiality Agreement_ ") (it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement need not prohibit the making or amendment of a private
Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board) (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ "); _provided_ , that the Company shall promptly (and in no event

as expressly permitted by Sections 6.2(e) and 6.2(f), at all times during the
period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and

prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may make a Change of
Recommendation, in connection with a Superior Proposal or in response to a
material event, occurrence, development or state of facts or circumstances
occurring after the date hereof that was neither known to the Company Board
nor reasonably foreseeable prior to the date hereof, in either case, if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and may also terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(a) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company Board shall not take such action unless:

(i) the Company shall have complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this Section 6.2;

(ii) the Company shall have provided prior written notice (a "
_Determination Notice_ ") to Parent at least 72 hours in advance (the "
_Notice Period_ ") to the effect that the Company Board intends to take such
action and specifying in reasonable detail the circumstances giving rise to
such proposed action, including, in the case such action is proposed to be
taken in connection with a Superior Proposal, the information specified by
Section 6.2(g) with respect to such Superior Proposal;

 

(iii) the Company shall have, and shall have caused its financial and legal
advisors to have, during the Notice Period, negotiated with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that
the failure to take such action would no longer be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the event of any material revisions to the terms of such Superior
Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new Determination
Notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section
6.2(e)(iii) with respect to such new Determination Notice and the revised

be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law (in
each case taking into account any written commitment received from Parent
prior to the expiration of the Notice Period providing for revisions to this
Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section 6.2(e)(iii)); and

 



-49- (v) in the event of a termination of this Agreement to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, the
Company shall have validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.3(a) and shall have paid the Termination Fee in accordance with
Section 8.5(b).

 

(f) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board from complying
with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to
an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders); _provided_ , that
if such disclosure withdraws or modifies the Company Recommendation in a
manner adverse to Parent, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change of
Recommendation (it being understood that a "stop, look and listen"
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act shall not in and of itself be deemed to be a withdrawal or
modification of the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent).

 

(g) _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent if any proposals or offers with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any non-public information
is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be
initiated or continued with, the Company or its Representative indicating, in
connection with such notice, the identity of the Person or group of Persons
making such offer or proposal and the material terms and conditions of any
proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written
requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter
shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and
terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto) and
the status of any such discussions or negotiations. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company shall provide to Parent, as soon as
practicable and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt or
delivery thereof, copies of all draft agreements (and any other written
material to the extent such material contains any financial terms, conditions
or other material terms relating to any Acquisition Proposal) sent by or
provided to the Company in connection with any Acquisition Proposal.

(h) None of the Company, the Company Board or any committee thereof shall from
and after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with any
Person that would limit the Companys ability to satisfy its obligations under
this Section 6.2, including its obligations to provide the information
described in Section 6.2(g) to Parent. 

(i) No Change of Recommendation shall change the approval of the Company Board
for purposes of causing any Takeover Statute to be inapplicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(j) The Company agrees that in the event any Subsidiary of the Company or any
Representative of the Company acting on behalf of the Company takes any action
which, if taken by the Company, would constitute a breach of this Section 6.2,
then the Company shall be deemed to be in breach of this Section 6.2.

 



-50- 6.3. _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

 

(a) _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use
(and shall cause their respective controlled Affiliates to use) their
respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions,
and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate
and make effective the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable, including preparing and
filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary
notices, reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable
all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary
or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity in order to consummate the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including under the HSR Act and
any other applicable Antitrust Law. In furtherance of and not in limitation of
the foregoing, Parent and the Company each shall file the initial pre-merger
notifications with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement required under the HSR Act and any other filings,
notifications or other applications that may be required pursuant to the
provisions of any other applicable Antitrust Laws no later than five (5)
business days after the date of this Agreement. The Company and Parent will
each request early termination of the waiting period or equivalent expedited
relief under the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Law with respect
to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Neither the Company nor Parent will withdraw and refile its
initial filing or take similar voluntary action to extend the review period
under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law unless the other party has
consented in writing in advance thereto (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall have the right to review
in advance and, to the extent practicable, each will consult with the other on
and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of
the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any
of their respective Affiliates, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; except that either party may designate
information "for outside counsel only" and either party may redact
information related to the value of the transaction. In exercising the
foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. Nothing in this Section 6.3 shall require Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates to take or agree to take any
action with respect to its business or operations unless the effectiveness of
such agreement or action is conditioned upon Closing. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Antitrust Law_ " means the Sherman Act, the Clayton
Act, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act and all other Laws and
judicial doctrines of any jurisdiction that are designed or intended to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening competition through merger
or acquisition (" _Antitrust Laws_ ").

 



-51- (b) _Information_. Subject to applicable Laws and Section 6.4, the Company and
Parent each shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all
information concerning itself, its Affiliates, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or application
made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that either party may designate
information "for outside counsel only" and either party may redact information
related to the value of the transaction. Subject to applicable Laws relating
to the exchange of information and except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance,
and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other regarding, and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the
information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Affiliates and Representatives, that appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and
Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

(c) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws, Section 6.4 and the instructions of
any Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other
communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or their
respective Representatives, from any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
either party may designate information or notices or other communications as
"for outside counsel only". Neither the Company nor Parent shall permit any of
its officers or other Representatives to participate in any meeting or
scheduled teleconference with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with
the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate
thereat.

 

(d) _Antitrust Matters_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, without limiting the generality of the other undertakings pursuant
to this Section 6.3(d), each of the Company (in the case of clauses (i) and
(iii) of this Section 6.3(d) set forth below) and Parent (in all cases set
forth below) agree to take or cause to be taken the following actions:

(i) to provide as promptly as practicable, to each and every federal, state,
local or foreign court or Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over
enforcement of any applicable Antitrust Law of non-privileged information and
documents requested by any such Governmental Entity or that are necessary,
proper or advisable to permit consummation of the Offer, the Merger, or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



-52- (ii) to use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry or enactment of
any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order, decree,
decision, determination, judgment, investigation or Law that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using its reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation on
the merits of any claim asserted in any court, agency or other proceeding by
any Person, including any Governmental Entity, seeking to delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of such transactions; and

(iii) in the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction,
decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or Law is entered, issued or
enacted, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered, issued or enacted in
or as a consequence of any proceeding, review or inquiry of any kind that
would make consummation of the Offer and the Merger in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would delay, restrain, prevent,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to use its reasonable best
efforts to take any and all steps (including, the appeal thereof, or, with
respect to Parent and Merger Sub, the posting of a bond or the taking of the
steps contemplated by Section 6.3(d)(ii) above) necessary to resist, vacate,
modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate, avoid or remove such actual,
anticipated or threatened injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination, decree or enactment so as to permit such consummation on a
schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement.

Parent acknowledges that its reasonable best efforts under this Section
6.3(d) include an obligation that Parent proffer and agree to sell, lease,
license or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate pending such disposition,
and to effect the sale, lease, license, disposal and holding separate of,
such assets, rights, product lines, licenses, categories of assets or
businesses or other operations, or interests therein (collectively, "assets or
businesses"), of the Company or Parent or eithers respective Subsidiaries,
and/or enter into agreements with, or submit to orders of, the relevant
Governmental Entity giving effect thereto (including with respect to selling,
licensing, holding separate or otherwise disposing of or encumbering any
assets or businesses or conducting its, the Companys or their respective
Subsidiaries businesses in any specific manner) to avoid, prevent, eliminate
or remove any impediment to the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Entity
under any Antitrust Law and so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible, and in any event, not later than the Termination Date,
including taking any action that would be reasonably necessary to avoid,
prevent, eliminate or remove the actual or threatened (A) commencement of any
proceeding in any forum or (B) issuance or enactment of any order, decree,
decision, determination, judgment or Law that would delay, restrain, prevent,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Entity
(it being understood that, as it relates to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
no such action will be binding on the Company or its Subsidiaries unless it is
contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing) (any action referred to in this
sentence a " _Required Action_ "); _provided_ _that_ in no event shall Parent
be required to take, or be required to offer to take or agree to take or
proffer, on behalf of itself, the Company and/or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, any Required Action with respect to any assets or businesses

 



-53-  if the revenues from such assets or businesses for the twelve (12) months
ended November 30, 2013, when combined with the assets or businesses that are
the subject of any other Required Action or other Required Actions, exceeded
the amount set forth on Section 6.3(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter.
Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives shall make
any offer, counter-offer, or otherwise engage in negotiations with any
Governmental Entity with respect to any proposed settlement, consent decree,
consent order, commitment or remedy, without the express written approval of
Parent (such approval not to be unreasonably conditioned, delayed
or withheld).

(e) _Consummation of the Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions
contained herein, the parties agree to take all necessary and appropriate
action to cause the Merger to become effective as promptly as practicable in
accordance with the DGCL. In furtherance, and not in limitation, of the
foregoing, following the Acceptance Time, if Parent, Merger Sub and
their Affiliates collectively own at least one Share more than the number of
shares required for Merger Sub to be merged into the Company in accordance
with Section 251(h) of the DGCL, the parties shall take all necessary and
appropriate actions to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as
practicable after such acquisition (including by causing the transfer of any
such Shares to Merger Sub) and in any event within one (1) business day of
such acquisition, in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event the consummation of the Merger is precluded by a
Statutory Impediment and if Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates shall
collectively acquire at least one share more than the Short-Form Threshold,
whether as a result of the exercise of the Top-Up or otherwise, the parties

effective as soon as possible after the Acceptance Time (including by causing
the transfer of any such Shares to Merger Sub), in accordance with Section 253

for the purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement (the "
_Stockholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable, including preparing and
filing with the SEC a proxy statement in connection with seeking the adoption
of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders at the Stockholders Meeting
(such proxy statement, together with all documents filed therewith, and as it
may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Proxy Statement_ ")
and causing the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as
promptly as practicable. At the Stockholders Meeting, or any postponement or
adjournment thereof, Parent shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the
Shares then owned by it, Merger Sub or any of their other Affiliates in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement. From and after the Acceptance Time until
the Effective Time, Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates shall at all times
maintain, and shall not divest, beneficial or record ownership of Shares. The
Company shall not change the record date for the Stockholders Meeting or
postpone or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent
of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Upon the request of Parent, the Company shall advise Parent as
promptly as practicable as to the aggregate tally of the proxies received by
the Company or its Representatives with respect to the Company Stockholder
Approval.

 



-54- (g) _Proxy Statement_. The Company shall afford Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement prior to its filing
with the SEC, including any amendments or supplements thereto, and shall give
due consideration to all the reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by Parent. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the
receipt of all comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and
of any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for
additional information and shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all
correspondence between the Company and/or any of its Representatives and the
SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent an
opportunity to review and comment on any such amendment, supplement or
response to the SEC and shall give due consideration to all the reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent. Parent and the
Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to promptly provide
responses to the SEC with respect to all comments received on the Proxy
Statement from the SEC.

6.4. _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable
prior written notice, the Company shall afford Parents officers and other
authorized Representatives (including, subject to the provisions on the
Companys cooperation set forth in Section 6.16(b), the Financing Sources)
reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior
to the Effective Time, to its employees, properties, books and records and,
during such period, the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent all
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as may
reasonably be requested, in each case, in a manner not unreasonably disruptive
to the operations of the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company (a) to permit
any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable
judgment of the Company would violate any obligations binding upon the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any third party, (b) to
disclose any privileged information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or (c) to disclose any information or permit any access or inspection that, in
the reasonable judgment of the Company, would cause any competitive harm to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries if the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement were not consummated; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the
event that the Company determines to withhold access or information pursuant
to clauses (a), (b) and (c), the Company shall use reasonable efforts to
obtain any waivers of third parties that are necessary to permit such
information to be disclosed to Parent and its Representatives and shall
reasonably cooperate with Parent to implement procedures that would remove
the basis for the determination so as to permit Parent or its Representatives
such access or disclosure, including pursuant to the use of "clean room"
arrangements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) Parent and
Merger Sub shall not be permitted prior to the Closing Date to contact any of
the Companys or its Subsidiaries vendors, customers, suppliers, contract
counterparties, joint venture partners or, other than as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement, Governmental Entities regarding the
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries without receiving the prior
written consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld)
and (ii) prior to the Closing Date, Parent and Merger Sub shall not have the
right to conduct any environmental testing, sampling or analysis at, on, under
or from any real property of the Company or its Subsidiaries. All requests for

Executive Officer of the Company or other Person designated by the Company.
All such information shall be governed by the terms of the Company
Confidentiality Agreement, the Joint Defense and Confidentiality Agreement,
dated as of December 5, 2013 between Parent and the Company (the " _Joint
Defense Agreement_ ") and the letter agreement executed on December 7, 2013
between Kirkland and Ellis LLP and Winston and Strawn LLP (the " _Clean Team
Agreement_ ").

Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be

making public announcements with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any
filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity (including

of the other party or parties (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by Law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national securities
exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the request of any
Governmental Entity (in which case the party required to issue or make such
press release or announcement shall give reasonable notice to the other party
or parties, including the opportunity to review and comment on such press
release or announcement to the extent practicable).

 

6.7. _Notice of Certain Events_. From and after the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall promptly
notify the other orally and in writing of (a) any change, event, circumstance

Offer or the Merger set forth in Article VII or _Exhibit A_ not to be
satisfied, (b) any Action commenced or, to any partys Knowledge, threatened
in writing against such party or any of its Affiliates by or before any

reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any
party to effect the Offer or the Merger set forth in Article VII or _Exhibit
A_ not to be satisfied; _provided_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section 6.7 shall not cure any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to any party.

with respect to appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or in

6.9. _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time (the "
_Benefit Period_ "), Parent shall provide or cause to be provided, to the
individuals who are employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of
the Effective Time, other than any employee who is covered by a collective
bargaining or similar agreement between the Company and any labor union (the
" _Continuing Employees_ "), (i) base salary no less that the base salary
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to each Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) annual cash bonus opportunity
and (iii) cash long-term incentive opportunity (in the case of this clause
(iii), only with respect to the four active 2013 - 2014 participants disclosed
to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement), that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to each
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iv) employee
benefits (other than equity compensation, severance benefits, and
benefits pursuant to a defined benefit pension plan) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries under the Benefit Plans set forth on Section 5.1(h) of the
Company Disclosure Letter to such employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (v) severance benefits equal to either the severance
benefits provided by (A) the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Acceptance Time under the severance

clearly designated as a severance program in such Section) to such employees
or (B) Parent to its similarly situated employees (which are set forth on
Section 6.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter). The preceding sentence shall
not preclude Parent or its Subsidiaries at any time following the Effective

reason (or no reason).

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility, vesting, and the level of
benefits (for severance, vacation or paid time off benefits) under the
employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent and its Subsidiaries
providing such benefits to any Continuing Employee during the Benefit Period,
each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service
with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before
the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was
entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service for the same
purpose under any similar Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of service or if such credit for service would not have been given
to similarly situated employees of Parent with respect to their period of
service with Parent. In addition, Parent shall cause (i) each Continuing
Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time,
in any and all

 



-57-  employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent and its Subsidiaries
providing benefits to any Continuing Employee during the Benefit Period
(including the Benefit Plans) (the " _Parent Plans_ ") to the extent coverage
under such Parent Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Benefit Plan
in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for
purposes of each Parent Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, any evidence of insurability
requirements, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such Parent Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable
or waived under the comparable Old Plan. Parent shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred by any Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
Continuing Employees participation in the corresponding Parent Plan begins
to be taken into account under such Parent Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year.

(c) The Company shall be permitted to (i) finally and conclusively determine
in good faith, in accordance with the terms of the Companys bonus plans (the
" _Bonus Plans_ ") as set forth on Section 5.1(h) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, and in the ordinary course of business, the amounts earned under the
Bonus Plans in respect of the 2013 fiscal year, deeming all applicable
performance targets to be fully achieved and (ii) pay each Bonus Plan
participant such amounts in respect of the 2013 fiscal year (including the
portion of the participants long-term cash bonus, if any, that has vested as
of December 31, 2013) in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, but no later than the Closing Date (and pay the remaining unpaid
portion of any long-term cash bonus on the Closing Date, taking into account
vesting in connection with transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of the applicable program). If the Closing Date has
not occurred by February 28, 2014, the Company shall be permitted to (A)
establish bonus targets, maximums and performance award levels and performance
measures for the 2014 fiscal year under the Bonus Plans in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice (which will be subject to Parents
modification for any portion of 2014 after the Effective Time, subject to the
requirements of Section 6.9(a)); _provided_ , _however_ , that such bonus
targets, maximums and performance award levels and performance measures for
the 2014 fiscal year shall be no greater than such amounts for the 2013 fiscal
year, and (B) pay such amounts in respect of the 2014 fiscal year on the
Closing Date, prorated based on the number of calendar days elapsed in the
2014 fiscal year through the Closing Date, based on the actual level of
performance achieved through the Closing Date, as finally and conclusively
determined in good faith by the Compensation Committee and ratified by the
independent directors of the Company Board, as applicable, prior to the
Closing Date.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall amend the Coleman Cable,
Inc. 401(k) Plan in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent, effective as of
the Effective Time, and take such other actions as are necessary to fully vest
the Continuing Employees in any unvested account balances held by such
Continuing Employee under the Coleman Cable, Inc. 401(k) Plan effective as of
the Effective Time.

 



-58- (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.9 to the contrary, other
than Section 6.9(d) nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, is
intended to constitute nor shall be treated as an amendment or other
modification of any employee benefit plan of the Company, Parent or their
respective Affiliates, nor shall limit the right of Parent and its Affiliates
to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any employee benefit plan of Parent or
its Affiliates (including, following the Effective Time, the Company and its
Subsidiaries).

 

(f) With respect to all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the
Company and/or any Subsidiary shall be responsible for providing any notices
required to be given and otherwise complying with the WARN Act or similar
foreign Laws as a result of action taken by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time.

 

(g) If requested by Parent at least five (5) business days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Benefit Plans
intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code that include a cash or
deferred arrangement intended to satisfy the provisions of Section 401(k) of
the Code (other than the Companys Union 401(k) Plan), effective not
later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time. In the event
that Parent requests that such 401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been terminated
pursuant to resolution of the Company Board (the form and substance of which
shall be subject to review and approval by Parent) effective not later than
the day immediately preceding the Effective Time.

 

(h) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this Section 6.9 are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and
that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create any
third party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other Person, including any
employees or former employees of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
Affiliate of the Company, any Continuing Employee, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with Parent or any of its
Affiliates.

 

6.10. _Expenses_. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expense.

6.11. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law (and Parent shall also advance expenses
as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; provided
that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that
such person is not entitled to indemnification), each present and former
director, officer and employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to such Indemnified
Parties service as a director, officer or employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or services performed by such Persons at the request of the
Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including, for
the avoidance of doubt, in connection with (i) the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (ii) actions to enforce this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party.

 



-59- (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies for
the extension of (i) the directors and officers liability coverage of the
Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies, and (ii) the
Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a
claims reporting or discovery period of six (6) years from and after
the Effective Time (the " _Tail Period_ ") from one or more insurance
carriers with the same or better credit rating as the Companys insurance
carrier as of the date hereof with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the insureds as the
Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the Company and the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for
the Tail Period the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least
as favorable to the insureds as provided in the Companys existing policies as
of the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to
purchase comparable DandO Insurance for the Tail Period with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided
in the Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the aggregate cost of the DandO
Insurance exceed during the Tail Period exceed 300% of the current annual
premiums paid by the Company for such purpose; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if the cost of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and from and after the Effective Time shall be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties, who shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section
6.11.

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.11 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate
of incorporation, by-laws or comparable governing documents of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws. All
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of 

 



-60-  expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as
provided in the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or comparable governing
documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any indemnification
agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall
survive the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such
Indemnified Party.

 

6.12. _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement the Company and the Company Board shall (to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law) grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act
to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such
transactions.

 

6.13. _Parent Consent_. Immediately following the execution of this Agreement,
Parent shall execute and deliver, in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL
and in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, a written consent
adopting the Merger Agreement.

 

6.14. _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company
(acting through the Compensation Committee of the Company Board) will take
all such actions as may be required to cause any agreements, arrangements or
understandings that have been or will be entered into by Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates with current or future
directors, officers or employees of the Company and its Affiliates pursuant
to which payments are made or to be made or benefits are granted or to be
granted according to such arrangements (including any amendment or
modification thereof) to be approved as an "employment compensation,
severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule
14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act and to satisfy the requirements of the
non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act.

6.15. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company will
take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated

Company (including derivative securities) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

 

6.16. _Financing_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) described in the
Debt Financing Commitments (or on terms no less favorable to Parent and Merger
Sub; so long as any such change in terms is not otherwise prohibited by this
Section 6.16(a), including the succeeding sentence), including using
reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Debt Financing
Commitments until the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, (ii) satisfy on a timely
basis all

 



-61-  conditions and covenants applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Debt
Financing Commitments that are within its control and otherwise comply with
its obligations thereunder, (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
(including the flex provisions) contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments
(or on terms no less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub; so long as any such
change in terms is not otherwise prohibited by this Section 6.16(a), including
the succeeding sentence), (iv) upon satisfaction of the conditions contained
in the Debt Financing Commitments, consummate the Debt Financing at or prior
to the Acceptance Time and (v) enforce its rights under the Debt Financing
Commitments. Parent and Merger Sub shall not (A) permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
the Debt Financing Commitments if such amendment, modification or waiver (x)
reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to be less than an amount
that, together with Parents cash on hand, would be less than the amount
required to be funded by Parent under this Agreement, (y) imposes new or
additional conditions precedent to the Debt Financing or otherwise expands the
conditions precedent to the Debt Financing (provided, that Parent and Merger
Sub may replace or amend the Debt Financing Commitments to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not
executed the Debt Financing Commitments as of the date of this Agreement) or
(z) would reasonably be expected to (I) make the funding of the Debt
Financing less likely to occur, (II) prevent the Closing Date or Acceptance
Time or (III) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce
its rights against the other parties to the Debt Financing Commitments or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto or (B) consent to an early
termination of the Debt Financing Commitments. Parent and Merger Sub shall
keep the Company reasonably informed (following a request by the Company) of
the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing or any Alternative
Financing, and promptly notify the Company in writing (1) if to the Knowledge
of Parent and Merger Sub there exists any breach or default (or any
other event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default)
under the Debt Financing Commitments, (2) of the receipt by Parent or Merger
Sub of any notice or communication from any Financing Source alleged or
actual any breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the
Debt Financing Commitments or (3) if for any reason, Parent or Merger Sub no
longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain all of the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments on the terms
described therein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including the flex provisions contained in the Redacted Fee Letter)
contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments, Parent and Merger Sub shall
give the Company prompt notice (which shall in no event be more than two (2)
business days from occurrence), and Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing
from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on terms not materially less
favorable from the standpoint of Parent and Merger Sub than those in the Debt
Financing Commitments (taking into account the flex provisions) as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event (an, " _Alternative
Financing_ ", and references in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall
be deemed to refer to such Alternative Financing). Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of
Parent be deemed or construed to require Parent to, and Parent shall not be
required to, (i) pay any fees in excess of those contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitments as in effect on the date hereof or (ii)

 



-62-  agree to any term that is outside of, or less favorable than, any applicable
economic provision of the Debt Financing Commitments as in effect on the date
hereof or any related fee letter (including any flex provision therein) as in
effect on the date hereof. Parent shall promptly provide a true, correct and
complete copy of all documentation with respect to an Alternative Financing
(with only the fee amounts and "flex" terms redacted; provided that no such
redacted terms affect conditionality or would result in a reduction in the
cash proceeds available to Parent and/or Merger Sub from the Debt Financing)
to the Company. For purposes of this Section 6.16, Debt Financing shall
include financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments as permitted
by this Section 6.16 to be replaced by an Alternative Financing and references
to Debt Financing Commitments shall include such documents permitted by this
Section 6.16 to be replaced by the documentation for an Alternative Financing,
in each case from and after such replacement.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, in all cases subject to and limited by the final
paragraph of this Section 6.16(b) and to the limitations on access and
reports set forth in Section 6.4, the Company shall use, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to use their, reasonable best efforts to, and use its and their
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to,

connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, including, without
limitation (in each case to the extent reasonably requested):

and other information required by the Financing Sources in connection with the
Debt Financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct
Terrorism Act of 2001, as amended;

 

(iii) executing and delivering any pledge and security documents, currency or
interest hedging arrangements, other definitive financing documents, or other
certificates, or documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent or
otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral (including

and instruments of termination or discharge) and using reasonable best
efforts to assist in obtaining local counsel and internal counsel legal
opinions;

or its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company,
nor any of their respective directors, shall (i) be required to commit to

authorizes the Company, subject to complying in all material respects with
the terms of Section 6.2, to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to a Superior Proposal; (ii) concurrently with the termination of
this Agreement the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal; and (iii) the Company prior to or
concurrently with such termination pays to Parent in immediately available
funds any fees required to be paid pursuant to Section 8.5(b);

(b) at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub
in this Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall have become
untrue after the date of this Agreement, and such breach or untruth prevents
Parent or Merger Sub from consummating the Offer, and such breach or untruth
is not curable or, if curable, is not cured prior to the earlier

 



-67-  of (i) thirty (30) calendar days after written notice thereof is given by
the Company to Parent or (ii) two (2) business days prior to the Termination
Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company is not then in material
breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the Tender Offer Conditions not
to be capable of being satisfied; or

 

(c) if Merger Sub fails to commence the Offer on or prior to the fifth (5th)
business day following the date on which Merger Sub shall have been required
to commence the Offer pursuant to Section 1.1(a) or if Merger Sub fails to
consummate the Offer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 

8.4. _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned by Parent:

(a) if the Company Board shall have made and not withdrawn a Change of
Recommendation; or

 

(b) if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by the Company in this Agreement, or any such representation
and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this Agreement, and
such breach or untruth gives rise to a failure of the Tender Offer Conditions
set forth in clauses (3) or (5) of _Exhibit A_ hereto to be satisfied and
such breach or untruth is not curable or, if curable, is not cured prior to
the earlier of (i) thirty (30) calendar days after written notice thereof is
given by Parent to the Company or (ii) two (2) business days prior to the
Termination Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent is not then in material
breach of this Agreement so as to prevent Parent or Merger Sub from
consummating the Offer.

 

8.5. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

 

(a) Except as provided in Section 8.5(b), in the event of termination of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to
this Article VIII, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no
liability to any Person on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its
Representatives or Affiliates); _provided_ , _however_ , and notwithstanding
anything in the foregoing to the contrary but subject to Section 8.5(d), that
(i) no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability for
damages to the other party hereto resulting from any breach of this Agreement
or fraud and (ii) the provisions set forth in this Section 8.5 and Section 9.1
shall survive the termination of this Agreement. In no event shall any party
be liable for punitive damages.

 

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) (x) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.2(a), Section
8.2(c) (and, in the case of Section 8.2(c), at the time of the expiration of
the Offer referenced in Section 8.2(c), the sole unsatisfied Tender Offer
Condition (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Acceptance Time and the condition with respect to the
delivery of certificates referenced in clause (6) of _Exhibit A_ ) is the
Minimum Condition) or Section 8.4(b), (y) any Person shall have made a _bona
fide_ Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement but prior to such
termination, and

 



-68-  such Acquisition Proposal shall not have been publicly withdrawn prior to
such termination and (z) within twelve (12) months of such termination the
Company shall have entered into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal is
consummated at any time ( _provided_ that for purposes of this clause (z) the
references to "20%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be
deemed to be references to "75%");

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(a); or

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(a);

then the Company shall (A) in the case of clause (i) above, within five (5)
business days after the date on which the Company consummates the Acquisition
Proposal referred to in clause (i)(z) above, (B) in the case of clause (ii)
above, no later than five (5) business days after the date of such termination
and (C) in the case of clause (iii) above, prior to or concurrently with such
termination, pay Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately
available funds (it being understood that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion). For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Termination Fee_ " means an amount
equal to $15 million.

 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.4(b) under circumstances in which the Termination Fee is not
payable pursuant to Section 8.5(b), then the Company shall, following receipt
of an invoice therefor, promptly (and in any event within two (2) business
days) pay all of Parents reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees
and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) actually incurred by Parent
and its Subsidiaries on or prior to the termination of this Agreement in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Parent Expenses_ "), which amount shall in no event exceed $4 million in the
aggregate, by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts
designated by Parent; _provided_ , that the existence of circumstances which
could require the Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by the
Company pursuant to Section 8.5(b) shall not relieve the Company of its
obligations to pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.5(c);
_provided_ , _further_ , that the payment by the Company of the Parent
Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.5(c) shall not relieve the Company of any
subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.5(b).
In the event the Company pays the Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section
8.5(c), the amount of any Parent Expenses actually paid shall be credited
against any Termination Fee payable by the Company pursuant to Section 8.5(b).

 

(d) The parties acknowledge that (i) the agreements contained in this Section
8.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where any amount is payable pursuant to this Section 8.5 are
uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and, therefore, the amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 8.5 are not a penalty but rather constitute
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and
Merger Sub for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iii) without the agreements contained in this Section 8.5, Parent
and Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if
the Company fails to

 



-69-  promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.5 and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the Company for any amount set forth in this Section 8.5 or
any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub all costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by Parent and Merger Sub in
connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount or portion
thereof at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made through the date of payment. Parents receipt of the
Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to this Section 8.5 (plus the
amounts described in the preceding sentence, if any) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates against
the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current, or
future general or limited partners, stockholders, directors, officers,
managers, members, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives for any loss
suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in this
Agreement or the failure of the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated. In the event such amounts
are paid by the Company, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective former, current, or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, directors, officers, managers, members, Affiliates, agents or
other Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In no event will Parent or Merger
Sub be entitled to both the payment of the Termination Fee and/or the Parent
Expenses, on the one hand, and specific performance of this Agreement, on the
other hand. The parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that in light
of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with respect to the
foregoing, upon any such termination of this Agreement, the payment of the
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.5(b), which constitutes a reasonable
estimate of the monetary damages that will be suffered by Parent and Merger
Sub by reason of breach or termination of this Agreement, shall be in full and
complete satisfaction of any and all monetary damages of Parent and Merger
Sub arising out of or related to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any breach by the
Company), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the
Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach,
termination or failure.

 

8.6. _Notice of Termination_. The party desiring to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Article VIII shall give written notice of such termination
to the other party or parties specifying the provision or provisions of this
Article VIII relied upon by the invoking party.

 

ARTICLE IX

_Miscellaneous and General_

9.1. _Survival_. This Article IX and the agreements of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub contained in Article IV and Sections 6.9 (Employee Benefits), 6.10
(Expenses) and 6.11 (Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance)
shall survive the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This Article IX and the
agreements of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in Section 6.10
(Expenses) and Section 8.5 (Effect of Termination and Abandonment) and the
Confidentiality Agreements, the Joint Defense Agreement and the Clean Team
Agreement (in each case, subject

 



-70-  to the terms of such agreement) shall survive the termination of this
Agreement. All other representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in
this Agreement shall not survive the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the termination of
this Agreement.

9.2.  _Amendment; Extension; Waiver_. Subject to applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time prior to the
Effective Time by an instrument in writing signed by each party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after the Acceptance Time, no amendment shall be made that
decreases the Per Share Merger Consideration or that by Law requires approval
by stockholders of the Company without approval of such stockholders. At any
time prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (but shall not be under any
obligation to) (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other, (b) to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
of the other contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or
(c) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waive compliance with any
of the agreements of the other or any of the conditions for its benefit
contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that there shall be made no waiver
that by Law requires approval by stockholders of the Company without the
approval of such stockholders. Any agreement on the part of a party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by such party. The failure of any party to assert any of its
rights hereunder or applicable Law shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no single or
partial exercise by any party of any of its rights hereunder precludes any
other or further exercise of such rights or any other rights hereunder or
applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
this sentence of this Section 9.2, the first sentence and the last sentence of
Section 9.4(a), Section 9.4(b), Section 9.6, clause (ii) of Section 9.7 and
Section 9.13 may not be amended, modified, waived or terminated in a manner
that is adverse in any respect to the Financing Sources without the prior
written consent of the Financing Sources, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

9.3. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original
instrument, and all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the
same agreement.

 

9.4. _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF.
The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction
of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or to the extent such Court
does not have jurisdiction, the United States District Court of the District
of Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_ ") solely in respect of the interpretation
and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the
documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense
in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement 

 



-71-  hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such
action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in the
Chosen Courts, that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or that the
venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such
document may not be enforced in or by such Chosen Courts, and the parties
hereto irrevocably agree that all claims relating to such action, suit or
proceeding shall be heard and determined in the Chosen Courts. The parties
hereby consent to and grant any such Chosen Court jurisdiction over the person
of such parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the subject matter
of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in
connection with any such action, suit or proceeding in the manner provided in
Section 9.5 shall be valid, effective and sufficient service thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties agrees that it will not
bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim of any kind or nature (whether at law, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) against any Financing Source relating to this Agreement, the Debt
Financing Commitments or the Debt Financing other than in the Supreme Court of
the State of New York, County of New York, or if under applicable Law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in Federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and the appellate
courts thereof).

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION,
SUIT OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY
CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE DEBT FINANCING. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY,
AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.4.

(c) The parties agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement)
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement, and to
enforce specifically, the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the
Chosen Courts (including the obligation of the parties hereto to consummate
the Offer and the Merger in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which such party is entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties further
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other party has
an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

hereto), the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company Confidentiality
Agreement, the Letter Agreement, dated November 15, 2013, between Parent and
the Company, the Joint Defense Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, dated
December 18, 2013, between Parent and the Company (the " _Parent

Agreement, the " _Confidentiality Agreements_ ") and the Clean Team Agreement
constitute the entire agreement and supersede all other prior agreements,
understandings, representations and warranties both written and oral, among
the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

9.7. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Parent and the Company hereby agree that
their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein
are solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and
subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to,
and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder, including, without limitation, the right to rely upon
the representations and warranties set forth herein except that (i) from and
after the Effective Time, the Indemnified Parties shall have such rights as
are provided in Section 6.11 (Indemnification; Directors and Officers
Insurance) and (ii) the Financing Sources shall have such rights as are
provided in the last sentence of Section 9.2, the first sentence and the
last sentence of Section 9.4(a), Section 9.4(b), Section 9.6, this clause
(ii) and Section 9.13. The representations and warranties in this Agreement
are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the
sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations
and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with
Section 9.2 without notice or liability to any other Person. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 

9.8. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include
an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 

9.9. _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in Annex A is defined in the
Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term. 

9.10. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision

 



-74-  and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such
invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability
affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application of
such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

 

9.11. _Interpretation; Construction_. The table of contents and headings
herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the
provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or
Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation". The definition of any
term defined herein shall be deemed to apply to singular and plural variants
of such term. All pronouns and all variations thereof shall be deemed to refer
to the masculine, feminine or neuter, singular or plural, as the identity of
the Person may require. All accounting terms used but not specifically
defined herein shall be construed in accordance with GAAP. Where a reference
in this Agreement is made to any agreement (including this Agreement),
contract, statute or regulation, such references are to, except as context
may otherwise require, the agreement, contract, statute or regulation as
amended, modified, supplemented, restated or replaced from time to time (in
the case of an agreement or contract, to the extent permitted by the terms
thereof); and to any section of any statute or regulation including any
successor to the section and, in the case of any statute, any rules or
regulations promulgated thereunder. All references to "dollars" or "$"
in this Agreement are to United States dollars. The parties have participated
jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an
ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption
or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of
the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. The Company has or may have
set forth information in the Company Disclosure Letter in a section of the
Company Disclosure Letter that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to
which it relates. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Letter to this Agreement shall not, in and of itself, be
construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this
Agreement.

9.12. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of
law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Parent may designate, by
written notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect
Subsidiary to be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which
event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such
other Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein
with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as
of the date of such designation; _provided_ that any such designation shall
not impede or delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise impair the rights of
the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement and (ii) subject to
Section 1.4(e), Parent may collaterally assign any of its rights, but not
its obligations, under this Agreement to any of its Financing Sources. Any
purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

 



-75- 9.13. _No Recourse_. No Financing Source shall have any liability (a) for
any obligations or liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or (b) to the
Company or its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Debt Financing, whether at Law or equity, in contract or otherwise, and
neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates will have any rights or claims
against any of the providers of Debt Financing hereunder or thereunder.
Without limiting the rights of the Company against Parent and Merger Sub, in
no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and the Company agrees
not to and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, seek to directly enforce this
Agreement or the Debt Financing Commitments against, make any direct claims
for breach of this Agreement or the Debt Financing Commitments against, or
directly seek to recover monetary damages under this Agreement or the Debt
Financing Commitments from, any Financing Source.

 



-76- IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
duly authorized officers of the parties hereto as of the date first written
above.

TENDER OFFER CONDITIONS

 

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, but subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be required
to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub to, accept for
payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC,
including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger Subs
obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after termination or
withdrawal of the Offer), pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer
(and not theretofore accepted for payment or paid for) unless (i) there shall
be validly tendered and not withdrawn at or prior to the Expiration Date that
number of Shares that represents at least a majority of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock on a fully diluted basis as of the scheduled Expiration Date
(assuming the issuance of all shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise of all outstanding Company Options and other rights to purchase
shares of Common Stock) (such condition, the " _Minimum Condition_ ") and (ii)
the waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation
of the Offer and the Merger under the HSR Act shall have expired or been
terminated (such condition, the " _Regulatory Condition_ ").

 

In addition and notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, but subject
to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub shall not
be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub to,
accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger Subs
obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after termination or
withdrawal of the Offer), pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer
(and not theretofore accepted for payment or paid for) if at any time on or
after the date of the commencement of the Offer and prior to the scheduled
Expiration Date, any of the following events shall occur and be continuing at
the scheduled Expiration Date:

 



     | (1) | this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
its terms; 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and restrains, enjoins or
otherwise prohibits consummation of the Offer or the Merger (collectively, an
" _Order_ "); 
---|---|--- 



     | (3) |

(i) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Section 5.1(c) (Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness), Section 5.1(f)
(Absence of Certain Changes) and Section 5.1(m) (Takeover Statutes) of this
Agreement shall not have been true and correct in all respects as of the date
of this Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as of
such date and time (except to the extent that any such representation and
warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such
representation and warranty shall not have been true and correct as of such
earlier date), (ii) any of the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in Section 5.1(b) (Capital Structure) of this Agreement shall not
have been true and correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement
and as of the Expiration Date as though made on 

---|---|--- 
 



Ex. A-1 such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in
which case such representation and warranty shall not have been true and
correct as of such earlier date) except for any such inaccuracies or failures
to be so true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, that are _de
minimis_ ; (iii) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in Section 5.1(u) (Brokers and Finders) shall not have been true and
correct in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of
the Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date and time (except to
the extent that any such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of
an earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty shall not have
been true and correct as of such earlier date) or (iv) any of the other
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement
shall not have been true and correct (without giving effect to any materiality
or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifications set forth therein) as of the
date of this Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as
of such date and time (except to the extent that any such representation and
warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such
representation and warranty shall not have been true and correct as of such
earlier date) except where the failure of any such representations and
warranties to be so true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, would
not have a Company Material Adverse Effect; 
---|--- 
 



     | (4) | since the date of this Agreement, a Company Material Adverse
Effect shall have occurred and be continuing, except as disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Letter (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any
section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed
disclosure with respect to this condition only if the relevance of such item
to a Company Material Adverse Effect is readily apparent) and the Company
Reports filed or furnished with the SEC by the Company on or after January 1,
2012 (excluding any Excluded Disclosure); 
---|---|--- 



     | (5) | the Company shall not have performed in all material
respects all obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 



     | (6) | the Company shall not have delivered to Parent dated as of
the Expiration Date a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by a senior
executive officer of the Company to the effect that the conditions set forth
in clauses (3), (4) and (5) have been satisfied as of immediately prior to
the scheduled expiration of the Offer; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (7) | the Marketing Period shall not have been completed. 
---|---|--- 

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean
the first period of twenty (20) consecutive business days following the
commencement of the Offer throughout which Parent shall have received the
Required Information and such Required Information is Compliant; _provided_ ,
that if such twenty (20) consecutive business day period has not ended by
December 20, 2013, then it shall not commence until on or after January 13,
2014. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Marketing Period will end on any
earlier date that is the date on which the Debt Financing is otherwise
consummated if such date is prior to the end of such

 



Ex. A-2  twenty (20) business day period. If at any time the Company reasonably
believes that it has delivered the Required Information, then the Company may
deliver to Parent and Merger Sub written notice to that effect, in which case
the Marketing Period will deemed to have begun on the date such notice has
been delivered (which shall not in any event be until on or after January 13,
2014), unless Parent in good faith believes that the Company has not
delivered the Required Information, and, within five (5) business days after
the delivery of such notice, delivers written notice to the Company stating
with reasonable specificity which items of the Required Information has
not been provided.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Compliant_ " shall mean, with
respect to the Required Information, that: (a) such Required Information does
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact, in each case with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
necessary in order to make the statements contained in such Required
Information, as of their respective dates and taken as a whole, in the light
of the circumstances in which they were made, not materially misleading and
(b) the Companys auditors have not withdrawn any audit opinion with respect
to any financial statements contained in the Required Information.

The foregoing conditions shall be for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger
Sub and may be asserted or waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part
at any time and from time to time, in each case, except for the Minimum
Condition, subject to the terms of this Agreement and applicable Law. The
foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, the
rights and obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate or modify
the Offer subject to, and in accordance with, the terms and conditions
of this Agreement. Any Shares subject to notices of guaranteed delivery shall
be deemed not to be validly tendered for purposes of satisfying the Minimum
Condition unless and until the Shares underlying such notices of guaranteed
delivery are delivered to or on behalf of Merger Sub. Any reference in this
_Exhibit A_ or elsewhere in this Agreement to a condition or requirement
being satisfied shall be deemed to be satisfied if such condition or
requirement is so waived. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this
_Exhibit A_ shall have the meaning ascribed to them elsewhere in this
Agreement to which this _Exhibit A_ is attached.
