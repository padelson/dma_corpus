default, and the applicable Seller party to such Lease has paid all rent due

material compliance with Applicable Law. The Sellers have disclosed to the

compliance would not have a Material Adverse Effect, the Sellers are and have
been in compliance with all Environmental Laws and have not received written
notice of any investigation or liability under, or violation of, any
Environmental Laws. To the Sellers' knowledge and except as would not be
reasonably anticipated to have a Material Adverse Effect, no event has
occurred and no circumstances exist that (with or without the passage of time
or the giving of notice) would result in a violation of, conflict with, or
failure on the part of any Seller to own and operate the Transferred Assets in
compliance with Environmental Law.

4.13 Transferred Contracts. Each Transferred Contract is valid and binding on
the applicable Seller party thereto in accordance with its terms and is in
full force and effect. None of such Seller or, to Sellers' knowledge, any
other party thereto is in breach of or default under (or is alleged to be in
breach of or default under) in any material respect, or has provided or
received any written notice of any intention to terminate, any Transferred
Contract. No event or circumstance has occurred that, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute a material event of default under any
Transferred Contract or result in a termination thereof or would cause or
permit the acceleration or other changes of any right or obligation or the
loss of any benefit thereunder. Complete and correct copies of each
Transferred Contract (including all modifications, amendments and supplements
thereto and waivers thereunder) have been made available to the Buyer.

4.14 Conflicts Committee Matters. The projections and budgets provided to the
conflicts committee of the board of directors of the General Partner
(including those provided to the financial advisor to the conflicts committee)
as part of its review in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby were prepared and delivered in good faith and have a
reasonable basis and are consistent with the current expectations of the
Sellers' management regarding the Transferred Assets.

ARTICLE VI 
COVENANTS

6.1 Additional Agreements. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and the Omnibus Agreement, each of the
Parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to do, or cause to be
taken all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper,
or advisable under Applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.2 Further Assurances. After the Closing, each Party shall take such further
actions, including obtaining Consents to assignment from third parties, and
execute such further documents as may be necessary or reasonably requested by
the other Party in order to effectuate the intent of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents and to provide such other Party with the intended benefits
of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents. Following the Closing, the
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, agree to remit to
the other Party or its Affiliates, as applicable, with reasonable promptness,
any payments, rebates, bills or other correspondence received on or in respect
of, or otherwise relevant to the other Party or its Affiliates including, with
respect to the Buyer, the Transferred Assets or, with respect to the Sellers,
the Excluded Assets.

6.3 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Following the Closing Date, the Parties shall
cooperate fully with each other and shall make available to the other, as
reasonably requested and at the expense of the requesting Party, and to any
Governmental Authority responsible for the administration of any tax, all
information, records or documents relating to tax liabilities or potential tax
liabilities of any Seller or related to the Transferred Assets for all periods
at or prior to the Effective Time and any information which may be relevant to

6.4 Cooperation for Litigation and Other Actions. Each Party shall cooperate
reasonably with the other Party, at the requesting Party's expense (but
including only out-of-pocket expenses to unaffiliated third parties,
photocopying and delivery costs and not the costs incurred by any Party for
the wages or other benefits paid to its officers, directors or employees), in
furnishing reasonably available information, testimony and other assistance in
connection with any proceedings, tax audits or other Disputes involving any of
the Parties (other than in connection with Disputes between the Parties). 

6.5 Retention of and Access to Books and Records.

(a) As promptly as practicable and in any event before 30 days after the
Closing Date, each Seller will deliver or cause to be delivered to the Buyer,
the Books and Records that are in the possession or control of such Seller or
its Affiliates.

(b) The Buyer agrees to afford each Seller and its Affiliates and their
respective accountants, counsel and other designated individuals, during
normal business hours, upon reasonable request, at a mutually agreeable time,
full access to and the right to make copies of (i) the Books and Records (to
the extent relating to the ownership and operation of the Transferred Assets
prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) the books, records and software related
to the marketing activities and services performed by the Buyer pursuant to
the Marketing Agreement, in each case, at no cost to such Seller or its
Affiliates (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses); provided that
such access will not be construed to require the disclosure of such Books and
Records that would cause the waiver of any attorney-client, work product or
like privilege; provided, further, that in the event of any litigation,
nothing herein shall limit any Party's rights of discovery under Applicable
Law. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentences, the Buyer
agrees to provide each Seller and its Affiliates reasonable access to and the
right to make copies of the Books and Records (to the extent relating to the
ownership and operation of the Transferred Assets prior to the Effective Time)
after the Closing for the purposes of assisting such Seller and its Affiliates
(i) in complying with such Seller's obligations under this Agreement, (ii) in
preparing and delivering any accounting statements provided for under this
Agreement and adjusting, prorating and settling the charges and credits
provided for in this Agreement, (iii) in owning or operating the Excluded
Assets, (iv) in preparing tax returns, (v) in responding to or disputing any
tax audit, (vi) in asserting, defending or otherwise dealing with any Action
or Dispute, known or unknown, under this Agreement or with respect to Excluded

Transferred Assets.

(c) The Sellers agree to afford the Buyer and its Affiliates and their
respective accountants, counsel and other designated individuals, during
normal business hours, upon reasonable request, at a mutually agreeable time,
full access to and the right to make copies of the Excluded Books and Records
(to the extent relating to the ownership and operation of the Transferred
Assets) at no cost to the Buyer or its Affiliates (other than for reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses); provided that such access will not be construed to
require the disclosure of such Excluded Books and Records that would cause the
waiver of any attorney-client, work product or like privilege; provided,
further, that in the event of any litigation, nothing herein shall limit any
Party's rights of discovery under Applicable Law.

6.6 Environmental Consent Decree. Upon the Sellers' request and solely to the
extent that any Transferred Asset is subject to the Environmental Consent
Decree, the Buyer will execute a modification to the Environmental Consent
Decree that makes the Buyer responsible for complying with the terms and
conditions of the Environmental Consent Decree as may be required by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency with respect to such Transferred
Assets. The Parties 

acknowledge that the prior sentence does not affect the indemnity in Section
3.1(a) of the Omnibus Agreement or in Article IX of this Agreement.

6.7 Delayed Assets.

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Transferred Asset,
the assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of which to the Buyer without
a Consent would constitute a breach or other contravention of Applicable Law
or the terms of such Transferred Asset and any easements related to the
pipelines located outside of the refinery property, to the extent not
otherwise transferred at Closing (a "Delayed Asset"), shall not be assigned,
transferred, conveyed or delivered to the Buyer until such time as such
Consent is obtained, at which time such Delayed Asset shall be automatically
assigned, transferred, conveyed or delivered without further action on the
part of the Buyer or the applicable Seller.

(b) Until such time as such Consent is obtained, (i) each Party (and its
applicable subsidiaries and Affiliates) shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the relevant Consent; provided, that no Party shall be
required to pay any monies or give any other consideration in order to obtain
any such Consents, (ii) the Sellers shall endeavor to provide the Buyer with
the benefits under each Delayed Asset as if such Delayed Asset had been
assigned to the Buyer (including by means of any subcontracting, sublicensing
or subleasing arrangement), to the extent such is permitted under the
applicable Delayed Assets, (iii) the Sellers shall promptly pay over to the
Buyer or its subsidiaries payments received by the Sellers after the Closing
in respect of all Delayed Assets, and (iv) the Buyer shall be responsible for
the Liabilities of the Sellers with respect to such Delayed Asset to the
extent arising after the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any other provision
in this Agreement to the contrary, following the assignment, transfer,
conveyance and delivery of any Delayed Asset, the applicable Delayed Asset
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as a Transferred Asset.

(c) The Buyer hereby agrees that the failure to obtain any such Consent
referred to in this Section 6.7 or the failure of any such Delayed Asset to
constitute a Transferred Asset or any circumstances resulting therefrom shall
not constitute a breach by the Sellers of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement under this Agreement; provided, however, that any breach
by any Seller of its covenants in this Section 6.7 may constitute a breach
under this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 6.7 shall be deemed to
constitute an agreement to exclude from the Transferred Assets any such
Delayed Asset.

6.8 Reimbursement of Operating, Maintenance and Other Capital Expenditures.

(a) Through (x) the earlier of (i) the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date
or (ii) the applicable API 653 Inspection Date, with respect to any tanks
included in the Transferred Assets and (y) the applicable API 653 Inspection
Date, with respect to any API 653 Tank, the Sellers will reimburse the Buyer,
on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account specified by the Buyer promptly upon (but in any event within 30
days of) receipt of an invoice therefor, for any out-of-pocket expenses,
whether or not capitalized, that are incurred by the Buyer for inspections,
maintenance and repairs (other than those required in the ordinary course of
business) to such tank that are made to bring such assets into compliance with 

the American Petroleum Institute (API) Standard 653 for Aboveground Storage
Tanks ("API 653") With respect to tanks 001TK-203, 001TK-205, 001TK-206,
001TK-207, and 037TK-182, in the event that Delek US determines, in its sole
discretion, that repairs are unwarranted, Delek US shall determine the
portion, if any, of the capacity of such tank(s) that the Buyer shall replace
by constructing new tanks; the costs of any such construction shall be
reimbursed by the Sellers as if they were incurred for the inspection,
maintenance and repair of an API 653 tank pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence.

(b) Through the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, with respect to
Transferred Assets, the Sellers will reimburse the Buyer, on a dollar-for-
dollar basis all amounts by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account specified by the Buyer promptly upon (but in any event within 30 days
of) receipt of an invoice therefor, for each of the following:

(i) any out-of-pocket expenses, whether or not capitalized, that are incurred
by the Buyer for inspections, maintenance and repairs (other than those
required in the ordinary course of business) to equipment other than tanks
included as part of the Transferred Assets that are made to bring such assets
which are in need of repairs (other than ordinary repairs in the ordinary
course of business) into compliance with Applicable Law and reasonably good
working order to the extent such equipment was in service as of the Closing
Date but not in compliance with Applicable Law or in reasonably good working
order as of the Closing Date; and

(ii) expenses (including any fines and penalties) incurred by the Buyer for
the clean-up or repair of any condition caused by the failure of any
Transferred Asset prior to the completion of the activities described in
Sections 6.8(a) or 6.8(b)(i) with respect to such Transferred Asset.

6.9 Permits; Rights-of-Way and Connection Contracts.

(a) During the term of the longer of the Storage and Throughput Agreement and
the Asphalt Services Agreement, (i) the Sellers shall maintain all Permits
necessary for the operation of the Transferred Assets and shall not do
anything that causes a termination or suspension of such Permits, and (ii) if
the Buyer reasonably determines that it is necessary to transfer any such
Permits to the Buyer or its designee, the applicable Seller shall, at its own
expense, take such actions as are necessary to transfer such Permits.

(b) During the term of the longer of the Storage and Throughput Agreement and
the Asphalt Agreement, the Sellers shall continue to be responsible for their
respective obligations under the Contracts listed on Schedule (b) (the "Right-
of-Way and Connection Contracts"); provided, however, that the Buyer shall be
responsible for the performance of any obligations thereunder to maintain the
Transferred Assets, including maintaining any connections between pipelines
included in the Transferred Assets and third-party facilities. Upon written
request of the Buyer, the Sellers shall assign to the Seller any Right-of-Way
and Connection Contract to the extent assignable by the Sellers. 

6.10 Bulk Sales Laws. The Parties waive compliance with the provisions of any
bulk sales, bulk transfer or similar Applicable Laws of any jurisdiction that
may otherwise be applicable with respect to the sale of any or all of the
Transferred Assets to the Buyer; it being understood that any Liabilities
arising out of the failure of the Sellers to comply with the requirements and
provisions of any bulk sales, bulk transfer or similar Applicable Laws of any
jurisdiction which would not otherwise constitute Assumed Liabilities shall be
treated as Excluded Liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding
any bulk sales, bulk transfer, or similar Applicable Laws, Seller shall be
solely responsible for any taxes arising out of the ownership or operation of
the Transferred Assets prior to the Effective Time as provided in Section
3.4(a).

6.11 Duncan Terminal Matters. In the event that either (a) the Duncan Lease
or, if such lease is no longer applicable with respect to the Duncan Terminal,
the successor lease, is unable to be assigned to the Buyer on or before the
Closing Date or (b) the Buyer reasonably determines that the terms of the
Duncan Lease are unacceptable to the Buyer, then the Sellers or the Buyer
shall have the right, exercisable by written notice to the other Parties prior
to the Closing Date, to exclude the Duncan Terminal from the Transferred
Assets. If any Party exercises the right provided in the immediately preceding
sentence, (i) the Purchase Price shall be reduced by $8,000,000, (ii) the term
"Excluded Assets" shall be deemed to include the Duncan Terminal, (iii) no
Consent with respect to the assignment of the Duncan Lease shall be required
to be delivered at the Closing and (iv) the Storage and Throughput Agreement
shall not include the Duncan Terminal or any fees and obligations related
thereto.

this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of any of the conditions
specified in Article VII and such breach, inaccuracy or failure has not been
cured by such Seller within 10 days of the Seller's receipt of written notice

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 shall not
have been, or if it becomes apparent that any of such conditions will not be,

conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by the Buyer prior to the
Closing;

(c) by a Seller, by written notice to the Buyer if:

(i) no Seller is then in material breach of any provision of this Agreement

to fulfill any obligation of such Seller shall have been the cause of the
failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to the Outside Date.

ARTICLE IX 
INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 Indemnification of the Buyer and the Sellers. From and after the Closing

Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Buyer Indemnified Costs and
(b) the Buyer agrees to pay to, reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless the
Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Seller Indemnified
Costs; provided, that for purposes of this Section 9.1, any breach of each

with any covenant or agreement and the amount of any Buyer Indemnified Costs
or Seller Indemnified Costs, as applicable, arising from a breach thereof
shall be determined without giving effect to any qualification as to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect. For the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing indemnification is intended to be in addition to and not in
limitation of any indemnification to which the Parties may be entitled under
the Ancillary Documents.

9.2 Defense of Third-Party Claims. An Indemnified Party shall give prompt
written notice to the Sellers or the Buyer, as applicable (the "Indemnifying
Party"), of the commencement or assertion of any Action by a third party
(collectively, a "Third-party Action") in respect of which such Indemnified
Party seeks indemnification hereunder. Any failure so to notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any Liability
that such Indemnifying Party may have to such Indemnified Party under this
Article IX unless and only to the extent that the failure to give such notice
materially and adversely prejudices the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to assume control of the defense of, settle, or 

otherwise dispose of such Third-party Action on such terms as it deems
appropriate; provided, however, that:

(a) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at its own expense, to
participate in the defense of such Third-party Action (provided, however, that
the Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable attorneys' fees of the
Indemnified Party if (i) the employment of separate counsel shall have been
authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense
of such Third-party Action, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not have
employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to have
charge of such Third-party Action, (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have
reasonably concluded, upon the advice of counsel, that there may be defenses
available to such Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to
those available to the Indemnifying Party, or (iv) the Indemnified Party's
counsel shall have advised the Indemnified Party in writing, with a copy
delivered to the Indemnifying Party, that there is a material conflict of
interest that could violate applicable standards of professional conduct to
have common counsel);

(b) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written approval of the
Indemnified Party before entering into or making any settlement, compromise,
admission, or acknowledgment of the validity of such Third-party Action or any
Liability in respect thereof if, pursuant to or as a result of such
settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment, injunctive or other
equitable relief would be imposed against the Indemnified Party or if, in the
opinion of the Indemnified Party, such settlement, compromise, admission, or
acknowledgment could have a Material Adverse Effect on its business;

(c) the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnified Party of
a release from all Liability in respect of such Third-party Action; and

(d) the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control (but shall be
entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense of), and the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control over, the defense or
settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment of any Third-party Action
(i) as to which the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense within a
reasonable length of time or (ii) to the extent the Third-party Action seeks
an Order or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party which, if
successful, would materially adversely affect the business, operations,
assets, or financial condition of the Indemnified Party; provided, however,
that the Indemnified Party shall make no settlement, compromise, admission, or
acknowledgment that would give rise to Liability on the part of any
Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of such Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(e) The Parties shall extend reasonable cooperation in connection with the
defense of any Third-party Action pursuant to this Article IX and, in
connection therewith, shall furnish such records, information, and testimony
and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials, and
appeals as may be reasonably requested.

9.3 Direct Claims. In any case in which an Indemnified Party seeks
indemnification hereunder which is not subject to Section 9.2 because no
Third-party Action is involved (a "Direct Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall
notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of any Indemnified Costs which such
Indemnified Party claims are subject to indemnification under the terms
hereof. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.4(a), the failure of
the Indemnified Party to exercise promptness in such notification shall not
amount to a waiver of such claim unless and only to the extent that the
resulting delay materially and adversely prejudices the position of the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim. Such notice by the Indemnified
Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include
copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Indemnified Costs that has
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall have 30 days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to
such Direct Claim. The Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party
and its professional advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance
alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any
amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party
shall assist the Indemnifying Party's investigation by giving such information
and assistance (including access to the Indemnified Party's premises and
personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or
records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional advisors may
reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such
30-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such
claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such
remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject
to the provisions of this Agreement.

9.4 Limitations. The following provisions of this Section 9.4 shall limit the
indemnification obligations hereunder:

(a) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any Indemnified Costs
pursuant to this Article IX unless a written claim for indemnification in
accordance with Section 9.2 or Section 9.3 is given by the Indemnified Party
to the Indemnifying Party with respect thereto on or before 5:00 p.m.,
Nashville, Tennessee time, on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing
Date; provided, however, that written claims for indemnification (i) for
Indemnified Costs arising out of (x) a breach of any Fundamental
Representations or (y) an Excluded Liability or any Pro-Rated Item may be made
at any time and (ii) for Indemnified Costs arising out of a breach of any
covenant may be made at any time prior to the expiration of such covenant
according to its terms.

(b) An Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to pay for any Indemnified
Costs under this Article IX until the amount of all such Indemnified Costs
exceeds, in the aggregate, $2,362,500, in which event Indemnifying Party shall
pay or be liable for all such Indemnified Costs from the first dollar. The
aggregate liability of an Indemnifying Party under this Article IX shall not
exceed $31,500,000. The limitations in the previous two sentences shall not
apply to Indemnified Costs to the extent such costs arise out of (i) a breach
of any Fundamental Representations, (ii) an Assumed Liability, (iii) an
Excluded Liability or any Pro-Rated Item or (iv) breach of any covenant or
other agreement of the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement.

(c) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, after the Closing Date,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Buyer's and the other Buyer Indemnified Parties' and each Seller's and the
other Seller Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
the Indemnified Costs shall be in accordance with, and limited by, the
provisions set forth in this Article IX. The Parties further acknowledge and
agree that the foregoing is not the remedy for and does not limit the Parties'
remedies for matters covered by the indemnification provisions contained in
the Ancillary Documents. Any indemnification obligation of any Seller to the
Buyer Indemnified Parties on the one hand, or the Buyer to the Seller
Indemnified Parties on the other hand, pursuant to this Article IX shall be
reduced by an amount equal to any indemnification recovery by such Indemnified
Parties pursuant to the other Ancillary Documents between the Parties to the
extent that such other indemnification recovery arises out of the same event
or circumstance giving rise to the indemnification obligation of the Sellers
or the Buyer, respectively, hereunder.

9.5 Payments. Once an Indemnified Cost is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party
or finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this Article IX, the
Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within 10 Business Days of
such agreement or final adjudication by wire transfer of immediately available
funds. The Parties agree that should an Indemnifying Party not make full
payment of any such obligations within such 10 Business Day period, any amount
payable shall accrue interest from and including the date of agreement of the
Indemnifying Party or final adjudication to and including the date such
payment has been made at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate plus 2%.
Such interest shall be calculated daily on the basis of a 365 day year and the
actual number of days elapsed. 

9.6 Tax Related Adjustments. Each Seller and the Buyer agree that any payment
of Indemnified Costs and any payments pursuant to Section 2.5(b) or Section
6.8 made hereunder will be treated by the Parties to the extent allowed by
Applicable Law, on their tax returns as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

9.7 Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties, and covenants of
the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification
with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party (including by any
of its representatives) or by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party
knew or should have known that any such representation or warranty is, was or
might be inaccurate.

ARTICLE X 
LIMITED GUARANTY

10.1 Limited Guaranty by Delek US. Delek US hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees to the Buyer the due and punctual payment of all
payment obligations of the Sellers insofar as such payment obligations relate
to the indemnification under Article IX. In the case of the failure of the
Sellers to make any such payment as and when due, Delek US hereby agrees to
make such payment or cause such payment to be made, promptly upon written
demand by the Buyer to Delek US, but any delay in providing such notice shall
not under any circumstances reduce the liability of Delek US or operate as a
waiver of the Buyer's right to demand payment.

ARTICLE XI 
MISCELLANEOUS

11.1 Expenses. Except as provided in Section 3.4 of this Agreement, or as
provided in the Ancillary Documents, all costs and expenses incurred by the
Parties in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and the Ancillary Agreements shall be borne solely and entirely by the
Party which has incurred such expense. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer
shall be responsible for all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and
expenses) incurred by the conflicts committee of the General Partner in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein.
Except as this Agreement otherwise provides, the Sellers, on the one hand, and
the Buyer, on the other, shall each be responsible for 50% of the payment of
the aggregate costs associated with obtaining the Consents necessary to effect
the transfer of the Transferred Assets to the Buyer as contemplated herein.

11.2 Notices. All notices, requests, demands, and other communications
hereunder will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given upon
confirmation of actual delivery thereof: (a) by transmission by facsimile or
hand delivery; (b) mailed via the official governmental mail system, sent
first class, postage pre-paid, via certified or registered mail, with a return
receipt requested; (c) mailed by an internationally recognized overnight

or to such other address or to such other Person as either Party will have
last designated by notice to the other Party.

11.3 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be
interpreted in such manner as to be valid and effective under Applicable Law,
but if any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such
provision to any Person or circumstance will be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such 

invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision
hereof in accordance with this Section 11.3, and the Parties will negotiate in
good faith with a view to substitute for such provision a suitable and
equitable solution in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision.

11.4 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be subject to and governed by the
laws of the State of Texas, excluding any conflicts-of-law rule or principle
that might refer the construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the
laws of another state.

11.5 Arbitration Provision. Any and all Disputes shall be resolved through the
use of binding arbitration using three arbitrators, in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as
supplemented to the extent necessary to determine any procedural appeal
questions by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code).
If there is any inconsistency between this Section 11.5 and the Commercial
Arbitration Rules or the Federal Arbitration Act, the terms of this Section
11.5 will control the rights and obligations of the Parties. Arbitration must
be initiated within the time limits set forth in this Agreement, or if no such
limits apply, then within a reasonable time or the time period allowed by the
applicable statute of limitations. Arbitration may be initiated by а Party
("Claimant") serving written notice on the other Party ("Respondent") that the
Claimant elects to refer the Dispute to binding arbitration. Claimant's notice
initiating binding arbitration must identify the arbitrator Claimant has
appointed. The Respondent shall respond to Claimant within 30 days after
receipt of Claimant's notice, identifying the arbitrator Respondent has
appointed. If the Respondent fails for any reason to name an arbitrator within
the 30-day period, Claimant shall petition the American Arbitration
Association for appointment of an arbitrator for Respondent's account. The two
arbitrators so chosen shall select а third arbitrator within 30 days after the
second arbitrator has been appointed. The Claimant will pay the compensation
and expenses of the arbitrator named by or for it, and the Respondent will pay
the compensation and expenses of the arbitrator named by or for it. The costs
of petitioning for the appointment of an arbitrator, if any, shall be paid by
Respondent. The Claimant and Respondent will each pay one-half of the
compensation and expenses of the third arbitrator. All arbitrators must (a) be
neutral parties who have never been officers, directors or employees of any
Seller, the Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates and (b) have not less
than seven years' experience of in the energy industry. The hearing will be
conducted in Houston, Texas and commence within 30 days after the selection of
the third arbitrator. Each Seller, the Buyer and the arbitrators shall proceed
diligently and in good faith in order that the award may be made as promptly
as possible. Except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the decision
of the arbitrators will be binding on and non-appealable by the Parties. The
arbitrators shall have no right to grant or award Special Damages in favor of
the Sellers, on the one hand (except to the extent such Special Damages (i)
are awarded to a third-party or (ii) are the result of the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Buyer), or the Buyer, on the other hand (except to
the extent such Special Damages (x) are awarded to a third-party, (y) are the
result of the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Seller, or
(z) the failure of any Seller to perform its obligations under Section 6.6).

11.6 Confidentiality. 

(a) Obligations. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
retain the other Party's Confidential Information in confidence and not
disclose the same to any third party nor use the same, except as authorized by
the disclosing Party in writing or as expressly permitted in this Section
11.6. Each Party further agrees to take the same care with the other Party's
Confidential Information as it does with its own, but in no event less than a
reasonable degree of care.

(b) Required Disclosure. Notwithstanding Section 11.6(a) above, if the
receiving Party becomes legally compelled to disclose the Confidential
Information by a Governmental Authority or Applicable Law, including the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or is required to
disclose pursuant to the rules and regulations of any national securities
exchange upon which the receiving Party or its parent entity is listed, any of
the disclosing Party's Confidential Information, the receiving Party shall
promptly advise the disclosing Party of such requirement to disclose
Confidential Information as soon as the receiving Party becomes aware that
such a requirement to disclose might become effective, in order that, where
possible, the disclosing Party may seek a protective order or such other
remedy as the disclosing Party may consider appropriate in the circumstances.
The receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the disclosing Party's
Confidential Information that it is required to disclose and shall cooperate
with the disclosing Party in allowing the disclosing Party to obtain such
protective order or other relief.

(c) Return of Information. Upon written request by the disclosing Party, all
of the disclosing Party's Confidential Information in whatever form shall be
returned to the disclosing Party upon termination of this Agreement or
destroyed with destruction certified by the receiving Party, without the
receiving Party retaining copies thereof except that one copy of all such
Confidential Information may be retained by a Party's legal department solely
to the extent that such Party is required to keep a copy of such Confidential
Information pursuant to Applicable Law, and the receiving Party shall be
entitled to retain any Confidential Information in the electronic form or
stored on automatic computer back-up archiving systems during the period such
backup or archived materials are retained under such Party's customary
procedures and policies; provided, however, that any Confidential Information
retained by the receiving Party shall be maintained subject to confidentiality
pursuant to the terms of this Section 11.6, and such archived or back-up
Confidential Information shall not be accessed except as required by
Applicable Law.

(d) Receiving Party Personnel. The receiving Party will limit access to the
Confidential Information of the disclosing Party to those of its employees,
attorneys and contractors that have a need to know such information in order
for the receiving Party to exercise or perform its rights and obligations
under this Agreement (the "Receiving Party Personnel"). The Receiving Party
Personnel who have access to any Confidential Information of the disclosing
Party will be made aware of the confidentiality provision of this Agreement
and will be required to abide by the terms thereof; provided, however, that
the receiving party will remain liable for any unauthorized disclosure of
Confidential Information by Receiving Party Personnel. Any third party
contractors that are given access to Confidential Information of a disclosing
Party pursuant to the terms hereof shall be required to sign a written
agreement pursuant to which such Receiving Party Personnel agree to be bound
by the provisions of this Agreement, which written agreement will expressly
state that it is enforceable against such Receiving Party Personnel by the
disclosing Party. 

(e) Survival. The obligation of confidentiality under this Section 11.6 shall
survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of two years.

11.7 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each Party hereto and their successors and permitted
assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any other Person (other than the Indemnified Parties with respect
to Article IX) any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

11.8 Assignment of Agreement. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any Party without the
prior written consent of the other Party hereto.

11.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts each of which, when so executed and delivered (including by
facsimile or portable document format (pdf)), will be deemed original but all
of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

11.10 Integration. This Agreement, the schedules hereto, the Ancillary
Documents and the Omnibus Agreement supersede any previous understandings or
agreements among the Parties, whether oral or written, with respect to their
subject matters. All schedules referred to herein are intended to be and
hereby are specifically made part of this Agreement. This Agreement, the
schedules hereto, the Ancillary Documents and the Omnibus Agreement contain
the entire understanding of the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof. No understanding, representation, promise or agreement,
whether oral or written, is intended to be or shall be included in or form
part of this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the Omnibus Agreement
unless it is contained in a written amendment hereto or thereto and executed
by the Parties hereto or thereto after the date of this Agreement, the
Ancillary Documents or the Omnibus Agreement.

11.11 Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be terminated, amended or modified
only by a written instrument executed by the Parties and approved by the
conflicts committee of the board of directors of the General Partner. Any of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement may be waived in writing at any
time by the Party entitled to the benefits thereof. No waiver of any of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, or any breach thereof, will be
effective unless in writing signed by a duly authorized individual on behalf
of the Party against which the waiver is sought to be enforced. No waiver of
any term or condition or of any breach of this Agreement will be deemed or
will constitute a waiver of any other term or condition or of any later breach
(whether or not similar), nor will such waiver constitute a continuing waiver
unless otherwise expressly provided.

11.12 Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants. The
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing until 5:00 p.m., Nashville, Tennessee time, on the first anniversary
of the Closing Date, and the covenants set forth in this Agreement shall
survive until fully performed in accordance with their terms; provided,
however, that (a) any representation and warranty that is the subject of a
claim for indemnification hereunder which claim was timely made pursuant to
Section 9.4(a) shall survive with respect to such claim until such claim is
finally paid or adjudicated and (b) the Fundamental Representations shall
survive indefinitely.
