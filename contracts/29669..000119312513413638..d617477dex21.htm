" _S-4 Registration Statement_ ") in connection with the issuance of Parent
Shares in the Merger, of which such proxy statement will form a part (such
proxy statement and prospectus constituting a part thereof, the "
_Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ "). Parent and the Company each shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the S-4 Registration Statement declared

(b) The Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries,
that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its
Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4

ARTICLE III.

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

3.1  _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or any holder of any share of capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub:

 

(a) _Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Excluded Shares_. All Excluded Shares held by Parent, if any, or in the
treasury of the Company or owned by the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All Excluded Shares
held by any Subsidiary of Parent or any Company Subsidiary shall
remain outstanding and unaffected by the Merger. " _Excluded Shares_ " shall
mean all Shares held by Parent, Merger Sub, any other Subsidiary of Parent,
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, plus any Dissenting Shares.

 



13 (c) _Conversion of Shares_.

 

(i) _Common Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than any Excluded Shares) shall be converted into
the right to receive (i) an amount in cash equal to $34.44, without interest
(the " _Per Share Cash Amount_ ") and (ii) 1.651 validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable shares of common stock, par value $1.25 per share (each, a
" _Parent Share_ "), of Parent (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ", and together with
the Per Share Cash Amount, the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "), payable
to the holder thereof in accordance with this _Article III_.

(ii) _Cancellation_. At the Effective Time, all Shares (other than Excluded
Shares held by any Subsidiary of Parent or any Company Subsidiary) shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate representing Shares that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any such outstanding Share (other
than any Excluded Share) (a " _Certificate_ ") and each non-certificated Share
represented by book-entry (other than any Excluded Share) (a " _Book Entry
Share_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration therefor upon
the surrender of such Certificate or Book Entry Share in accordance with
_Section 3.2_.

 

(d) _Certain Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if, at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of Shares shall
occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into or exchangeable for Shares)
with a record date during such period, then the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration payable under  _Section 3.1(c)_ in respect of such Shares
shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

(e) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
Parent Shares shall be issued upon the conversion of Shares pursuant to
_Section 3.1(c)_, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of Parent Shares. All
fractional shares which a single record holder of Shares would be otherwise
entitled to receive shall be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to
three decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of
Shares who would otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares shall be
entitled to an amount in cash, without interest, rounded down to the nearest
cent, equal to the product of (i) the amount of the fractional share interest
in a Parent Share to which such holder is entitled under _Section 3.1(c)_
(or would be entitled but for this _Section 3.1(e)_) and (ii) an amount equal
to the average of the closing sale prices of Parent Shares on Nasdaq for
each of the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending with the third (3rd)
complete trading day prior to the Closing Date (the " _Parent Trading Price_
"). As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash,
if any, to be paid to holders of Shares in lieu of any fractional Parent
Share interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts, without
interest, to the holders of Shares entitled to receive such cash.

 



14 3.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent selected by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), and pursuant
to an exchange agent agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the
benefit of the holders of Shares, subject to  _Section 3.2(b)(ii)_, an
aggregate number of Parent Shares and an aggregate amount of cash sufficient
to deliver the aggregate amount of Parent Shares and cash to which holders of
Shares shall become entitled pursuant to  _Section 3.1(c)(i)_ for the
purpose of exchanging the Per Share Merger Consideration for Certificates and
Book Entry Shares in accordance with this _Article III_. After the Effective
Time, on the appropriate payment date, if applicable, Parent shall promptly
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent the amount of any
dividends or other distributions payable on such Parent Shares pursuant to
_Section 3.2(b)_ (such Parent Shares and cash provided to the Exchange Agent
for the Per Share Merger Consideration, together with any dividends or other
distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). Parent shall promptly deposit with the Exchange Agent,
for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed, cash
sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with
_Section 3.1(e)_. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any purpose other than as set forth in this _Article III_ , and shall be
invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation solely in (i) direct obligations of the United States of America,
(ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii)
commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, or (iv) a combination of any
of the foregoing. Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall bear and pay the
fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent in connection with the exchange of
Shares and the Exchange Fund. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or
income produced by, such investments will be payable to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. To the extent there are any losses
with respect to any such investments, Parent shall promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to pay
the Per Share Cash Amount and any cash in lieu of fractional shares in
accordance with _Section 3.1(e)_.

(i) _Certificates_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or otherwise
deliver to each holder of record of a Certificate representing Shares which
were converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_, (A) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificate
(or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates as provided in _Section
3.2(f)_) to the Exchange Agent, which letter shall be in customary form and
have such provisions as are reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company)
and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of each such Certificate (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates as provided in _Section
3.2(f)_) in exchange for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement. If any
Dissenting Shares cease to be Dissenting Shares pursuant to _Section 3.3_,
Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent promptly after the date on which
Parent becomes aware that such Dissenting Shares have ceased to be Dissenting
Shares to mail to the holder of record of such Shares the letter
of transmittal and instructions referred to in the preceding sentence, with
respect to such Shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or

 



15  affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates as provided in _Section
3.2(f)_) to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, in accordance with the terms of such letter of
transmittal, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such
other documents as may be reasonably requested by the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange
thereof as promptly as practicable, (w) the Per Share Cash Amount, (x) the
number of whole Parent Shares (which shall be in non-certificated book
entry form, unless certificated Parent Shares are requested) representing, in
the aggregate, the whole number of Parent Shares that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)(i)_ (after taking into account
all Shares then held by such holder), (y) any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)(i)_ and (z) cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Shares payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(e)_, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of any
portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition of payment of such Per Share Merger Consideration that
(1) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer, as determined by the Exchange Agent and
as set forth in the letter of transmittal and related instructions and (2)
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid to the Exchange Agent in
advance any Tax required by reason of the payment of such Per Share Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.
Subject to _Section 3.3_, until surrendered as contemplated by this 
_Section 3.2(a)(i)_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate as
contemplated by  _Section 3.1(c)(i)_, dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)(i)_ and cash in lieu of any fractional
shares payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(e)_. No interest shall be paid or
accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

(ii) _Book Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article III_. In lieu thereof, each
holder of record of one or more Book Entry Shares whose Shares were converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration and any dividends
or other distributions payable pursuant to  _Section 3.2(b)(ii)_ shall upon
receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agents message" in customary form (or
such other evidence, if any, as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), be
entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and
deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of each such Share, any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to  _Section 3.2(b)(ii)_ and cash in lieu of
any fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(e)_, and the Book
Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled.

 

(b) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. All Parent Shares to be issued pursuant to the Merger
shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever
a dividend or

 



16  other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of Parent Shares, the
record date for which is after the Effective Time, that declaration shall
include dividends in respect of all Parent Shares issued pursuant to this
Agreement. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
Certificate, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional Parent Shares shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section 3.1(e)_, until the surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with this _Article III_. Subject to applicable
Law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
holder of the Parent Shares issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A)
at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a
fractional Parent Share to which such holder is entitled pursuant to 
_Section 3.1(e)_ and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole Parent Shares and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to Parent Shares with a
record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a
payment date subsequent to such surrender.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Holders of Book Entry Shares who are entitled to
receive Parent Shares under this _Article III_ shall be paid, without
interest, (A) at the time of payment and delivery of such Parent Shares by the
Exchange Agent under _Section 3.2(a)(ii)_, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole Parent Shares, and the amount of any cash payable
in lieu of a fractional Parent Share to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to _Section 3.1(e)_ and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to Parent Shares with a
record date after the Effective Time but prior to the time of such payment and
delivery by the Exchange Agent under _Section 3.2(a)(ii)_ and with a payment
date subsequent to the time of such payment and delivery by the Exchange Agent
under _Section 3.2(a)(ii)_.

(c)  _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. After the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. After the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book
Entry Shares evidencing ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares,
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article III_.

 

(d) _Termination of Fund: No Liability_. At any time following nine (9) months
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any certificates representing
Parent Shares and any funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto) which had been made available to the Exchange Agent for the payment
of Per Share Merger Consideration and which have not been disbursed to
holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders
shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation, which
shall thereafter act as the Exchange Agent (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Law), as general creditors thereof with respect to
the payment of any Per Share Merger Consideration (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto as contemplated by  _Section 3.2(b)_)
that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book Entry Shares, as
determined pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the

 



17  foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares for Per
Share Merger Consideration (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto as contemplated by _Section 3.2(b)_) properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(e) _Withholding Taxes_. The right of any Person to receive payment or
consideration payable upon surrender of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares
pursuant to the Merger will be subject to any applicable requirements with
respect to the withholding of any Tax. To the extent amounts are properly
withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, (i)
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Certificate or Book Entry Shares in
respect of which the deduction and withholding was made and (ii) Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case
may be, to promptly pay over such withheld amounts to the appropriate
Governmental Entity.

 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if requested by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the
delivery by such Person of a bond (in such amount as Parent or the Surviving
Corporation may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation on
account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the total amount of Per Share Merger Consideration (or dividends
or distributions with respect thereto as contemplated by _Section 3.2(b)_)
deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with this _Article
III_.

3.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, Shares which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and which are held by holders who shall have complied with
the provisions of Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the TBOC (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 10, Subchapter
H of the TBOC, unless and until the applicable holder fails to comply with the
provisions of Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the TBOC or effectively withdraws or
otherwise loses such holders rights to receive payment of the fair value of
such holders Shares under Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the TBOC. If, after the
Effective Time, any such holder fails to comply with the provisions of Chapter
10, Subchapter H of the TBOC or effectively withdraws or loses such right,
such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable Per
Share Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent notice of any
written demands for appraisal of Shares received by the Company under Chapter
10, Subchapter H of the TBOC, and shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal or offer to settle or
settle any such demands.

 



18 3.4 _Company Stock Options_.

 

(a) The Company represents and warrants that each option to acquire Shares
granted under any Company Equity Plans or any other agreement (each, a "
_Company Stock Option_ ") that is not fully exercisable as of the date of this
Agreement will automatically become fully vested and exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of the applicable Company
Equity Plans and Company Stock Options granted thereunder. At the Effective
Time, each Company Stock Option, without any action on the part of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holder of any such Company Stock Option,
shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to (i) the Per Share Stock Option Consideration
multiplied by (ii) the aggregate number of Shares into which the applicable
Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ that if the exercise price per Share of any such Company Stock
Option is equal to or greater than the Per Share Stock Option Consideration,
such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled without any cash payment being
made in respect thereof. Any payment made pursuant to this _Section 3.4(a)_
to the holder of any Company Stock Option shall be reduced by any income or
employment Tax withholding required under (A) the Code, (B) any applicable
state, local or foreign Tax Laws or (C) any other applicable Laws. To the
extent that any amounts are so withheld, those amounts shall be treated as
having been paid to the holder of that Company Stock Option for all purposes
under this Agreement. The Company, or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, shall make the payments in respect of the Company Stock Options as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the cancellation of such Company
Stock Options as contemplated by this _Section 3.4(a)_ (but in no event later
than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time). The Company shall
take all requisite action so that, at the Effective Time, each Company Stock
Option shall be cancelled and the applicable Company Equity Plans shall be
terminated.

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the
compensation committee of the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of _Section 3.4(a)_. The Company shall take all actions necessary
to ensure that from and after the Effective Time, neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Shares or other capital
stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company
Stock Options.

are forward-looking statements or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in
nature) or in the disclosure schedules delivered by the Company to Parent
and Merger Sub prior to entering into this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedules_ ") ( _it_ _being_ _agreed_ that (i) other than in the
case of the first sentence of _Section 4.6_, disclosure of any item in any
section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed
disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection to which the
relevance of such item is reasonably apparent and (ii) no disclosure contained
in the Company SEC Documents shall be deemed to qualify, modify or apply to
_Sections 4.2_ , _4.3_ and the first sentence of _Section 4.6_), the Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

4.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is (i) in the case of the
Company, a corporation, duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Texas or (ii) in the case of each
Company Subsidiary, a corporation, limited liability company or other type of
entity duly incorporated or formed (as the case may be), validly existing and
in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
formation (as the case may be), and each has the requisite corporate, limited
liability company or other power (as the case may be) and authority to own
or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted, except, in the case of the Company, where the failure
to be in good standing and, in the case of any Company Subsidiary, where the
failure to be so incorporated or formed (as the case may be), existing or in
good standing or to have such power and authority would not, individually or
in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The copies of the Company Articles and the Company By-Laws most recently
filed with the Company SEC Documents are complete and correct copies of such
documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. The Company has made
available to Parent complete and correct copies of the certificates of
incorporation and by-laws or comparable organizational and governing documents
of the Company Subsidiaries, each as amended to the date of this Agreement,
and each as so delivered is in full force and effect.

4.2  _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 100,000,000
Shares and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per
share, issuable in series. As of October 22, 2013, (x) 9,687,642 Shares and no
shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding, and (y) no Shares were
held in the Companys treasury. All of the issued and outstanding Shares have
been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and
were not issued in violation of any preemptive rights or rights of first
refusal created by Law, the Company Articles or any Contract to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which it or its assets are
bound. The Shares constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital stock
of the Company. Other than 1,769,501 Shares reserved for issuance under the
Company Equity Plans, the Company has no Shares reserved for issuance.
_Company Disclosure Schedule 4.2(a)(i)_ contains a correct and complete list,
as of the date of this Agreement, of Company Stock Options, specifically

stock or other securities of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, and no securities or
obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding
(collectively, " _Rights_ "). Each outstanding Company Stock Option (i) was
granted in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws and
all of the terms and conditions of the Company Equity Plan pursuant to which
it was issued, (ii) has an exercise price per Share equal to or greater than
the fair market value of a Share on the date of such grant, (iii) has a grant
date identical to the date on which the Company Board or compensation
committee of the Company Board actually awarded such Company Stock Option,
and (iv) qualifies for the tax and accounting treatment afforded to such
Company Stock Option in the Companys tax returns and the Company SEC
Documents, respectively. Upon issuance of any Share in accordance with the
terms of the Company Equity Plans, such Shares will be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear of any Liens.

(b)  _Company Disclosure Schedule 4.2(b)_ sets forth, (x) each Company
Subsidiary and the ownership interest of the Company and any other Company
Subsidiary in each Company Subsidiary, as well as the ownership interest of
any other Person in each Company Subsidiary and (y) as of the date of this

interest or other direct or indirect ownership interest in any other Person
other than securities in a publicly traded company held for investment by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary and consisting of less than one percent (1%)
of the outstanding capital stock of such company. The Company does not own,
directly or indirectly, any voting interest in any Person that requires an
additional filing by Parent under the HSR Act. The Company owns, directly or
indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of, or
other equity interests in, each of the Company Subsidiaries, free and clear
of any Liens, except for (i) Liens imposed under federal or state securities
Laws and (ii) Liens arising under the Company Credit Agreements (or any
replacements thereof) as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Each of
the outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of each Company
Subsidiary has been duly authorized and is validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and free of any preemptive rights or rights of first
refusal created by Law, the articles of incorporation, by-laws or similar
organizational and governing documents of any Company Subsidiary, or any
Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which
it or its assets are bound. There are no restrictions on the Company with
respect to voting the stock or other securities of any Company Subsidiary,
except for pledges of such stock or securities as collateral pursuant to the
Company Credit Agreements as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. The
Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into
or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the holders of
Shares on any matter.

(c) _Company Disclosure Schedule 4.2(c)_ sets forth each voting trust or
other agreement or understanding (other than the Voting Agreement) to which
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party, or to the Companys
Knowledge, any other voting agreement or understanding (other than the Voting
Agreement), with respect to the voting of the

 



21  capital stock and other Rights of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, other than any such voting trusts, agreements or understandings
to which neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party
disclosed in beneficial ownership reports on Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G
filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

4.3 _Authority_.

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and to consummate the
Transactions to be consummated by it, subject, in the case of this Agreement,
to the Company obtaining, prior to the Effective Time, the vote in favor of

power of the issued and outstanding Shares in accordance with Section 21.457
of the TBOC (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "). Other than the Company
Stockholder Approval, no vote of the holders of capital stock of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries is necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions. Each of this Agreement and the Voting
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
due and valid authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and Merger Sub and of the Voting Agreement by Parent and Joe R. Davis,

the Company in accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability (i)
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar
Laws affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors rights generally
and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity (the " _Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception_ ").

 

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Company Board unanimously adopted
resolutions (i) determining that the Merger is fair to, and in the best
interests of, the Company and the holders of Shares, (ii) approving, and
declaring to be advisable, this Agreement, the Merger and the other
Transactions to be consummated by the Company, (iii) recommending that the
holders of Shares vote in favor of the approval of this Agreement at the
Stockholders Meeting and (iv) irrevocably approving for all purposes, to the
maximum extent permitted by Law, (A) each of Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates and (B) this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the

Sub or any of their respective affiliates in connection with this Agreement,
the Voting Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions with respect to
any of the foregoing.

Governmental Approvals_ "), no consent or approval of, or filing, declaration
or registration with, any Governmental Entity, is required to be obtained or
made by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for the consummation by
the Company of the Transactions to be consummated by it, other than such
consents, approvals, filings, declarations or registrations that, if not
obtained or made, would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) None of the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the Voting Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions to be consummated by it, and compliance by the Company with any
of the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Voting Agreement, will
constitute or result in (i) a breach or violation of any provision of
the Company Articles or Company By-Laws or any of the similar organizational
or governing documents of any Company Subsidiary, (ii) assuming that the
Company Stockholder Approval and the Company Required Governmental Approvals
are received or made, as the case may be, prior to the Effective Time, a
breach or violation of any Law applicable to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets or (iii) a breach
or violation of or the loss of any benefit under, a default (or an event
which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default)
under, the termination of or a right of termination or cancellation under, the
creation, acceleration or change of any rights or obligations of any party or
the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under any Contract to which the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them
or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected,
except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for such breaches,
violations, losses of benefits, defaults, events, terminations, rights
of termination or cancellation, right or obligation creations, accelerations
or changes or Lien creations as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the Transactions.

(c) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are not creditors or claimants
with respect to any debtors or debtor-in-possession subject to proceedings
under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code with respect to claims

gross assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole
(excluding cash and cash equivalents).

not, and any Company SEC Documents filed with or furnished to the SEC

_Benefit Plans_ " shall not include any such agreement with respect to any
former employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries if, as of the date of this
Agreement, the Company or any Company Subsidiary, as applicable, has no
further obligations or potential liability under such agreement.

(b) With respect to each Benefit Plan, other than "multiemployer plans" within

administered in compliance in all material respects with its terms and the
applicable requirements of ERISA and the Code. Each U.S. Benefit Plan that is
intended to be qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code,
has received a favorable IRS determination letter as to its qualification or
is a prototype plan that is the subject of a favorable opinion letter from the
IRS or has applied to, or 

 



30  has time remaining in which to file an application with, the IRS for such
favorable determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment period
under Section 401(b) of the Code, and the Company is not aware of any
circumstances likely to result in the loss of the qualified or exempt status
of such U.S. Benefit Plan or its trust under Section 401(a) of the Code. To
the Companys Knowledge there are no circumstances likely to result in the
loss of the qualified or exempt status of such U.S. Benefit Plan or its trust.

or Section 414 of the Code makes or is obligated to make or within the past

period of such transaction expired as of the date of this Agreement, could
subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a material Tax or material
penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of
ERISA. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred or
reasonably expects to incur a material Tax or material penalty imposed by

which the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries participate or have
participated in the last six (6) years and the estimated aggregate withdrawal
liability of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for each such
Multiemployer Plan as most recently communicated to the Company in writing

representative).

(d) There are no material actions, litigations, audits, suits or claims
(other than routine claims for benefits in the Ordinary Course) pending or, to
the Companys Knowledge, threatened in writing against the Company or a
Company Subsidiary with respect to any Benefit Plan, other than
the Multiemployer Plans. To the Companys Knowledge, there are no material
actions, litigations, audits, suits or claims (other than routine claims for
benefits in the Ordinary Course) pending or threatened in writing against the
Company or a Company Subsidiary with respect to a Multiemployer Plan. Except
as may be required by applicable Law, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has any obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any
U.S. Benefit Plan or collective bargaining agreement. There are no material
loans by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to any current or
former employees, directors or consultants of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, other than loans under any U.S. Benefit Plan intended

in the Ordinary Course.

the Company Subsidiaries relating to, or increasing employee participation or
coverage under, any U.S Benefit Plan or Non-U.S. Benefit Plan which would
increase by more than five (5) percent the expense of maintaining such plan
above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the most recent
fiscal year. None of the execution of this Agreement, adoption of this

 



31  Agreement by the holders of Shares or the consummation of the Transactions
will, either alone or in combination with another event or events, (i) entitle
any current or former employees, independent contractors or directors of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in
severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date of this
Agreement, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any

Company Equity Plans, (iii) limit or restrict the right of the Company or,
after the consummation of the Transactions, Parent to merge, amend or
terminate any of the Benefit Plans (other than the Multiemployer Plans), (iv)
result in material payments under any of the Benefit Plans which would not be
deductible under 280G of the Code or (v) result in the payment of any amount
that could, individually or in combination with any other such payment,
constitute an "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of
the Code. The Company has made available to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement true, correct and complete copies of any Section 280G calculations
prepared (whether or not final) with respect to any disqualified individual in
connection with the Transactions.

such term is defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been
administered, in all material respects, in compliance with its terms and the
applicable operational and documentary requirements of Section 409A of the
Code and the regulations thereunder. Neither the Company nor any of

otherwise reimburse any individual for any excise Taxes, interest or penalties
incurred pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

Subsidiaries outside of the United States primarily for the benefit

outside of the United States (" _Non-U.S. Benefit Plans_ ") comply in all
material respects with applicable local law. All Non-U.S. Benefit Plans are

compel the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to bargain with any
labor union or labor organization nor is there pending or, to the Companys
Knowledge, threatened, nor has there been for the past three (3) years, any
labor strike, dispute, walk-out, work stoppage, labor picketing, slow-down,

the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. To the Companys Knowledge,
there are no organizational efforts with respect to the formation of a
collective bargaining unit presently being made involving employees of the
Company or any of

 



32  its Subsidiaries. The Company has previously made available to Parent
correct and complete copies of all labor and collective bargaining agreements,
or other Contracts with a labor union or labor organization to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is party or by which any of them are
otherwise bound (collectively, the " _Company Labor Agreements_ "). The
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions will not entitle any
third party (including any employee, labor union or labor organization) to any
payments from the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under any of the
Company Labor Agreements. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have paid
or made provision for payment of all salaries, wages, and vacation pay
accrued through the date of this Agreement in all material respects. There is
no charge pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened in writing before
the National Labor Relations Board or any other labor relations tribunal or

Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has any direct or indirect
material liability, whether actual or contingent, with respect to any

an employee, with respect to any misclassification of any employee as exempt
versus non-exempt, or with respect to any employee leased from another
employer. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has incurred
any liability or obligation under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining

registration and/or application number, the record owner, the appropriate
filing jurisdiction, and the registration or filing date.

 

(b) The Company and/or one or more of the Company Subsidiaries exclusively

ARTICLE V.

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

Except as set forth in the Parent SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to
the date of this Agreement (excluding, in each case, any disclosures set
forth in any risk factor section or in any other section to the extent they
are forward-looking statements or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in
nature) or in the disclosure schedules delivered by Parent and Merger Sub to
the Company prior to entering into this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure
Schedules_ ") ( _it_ _being_ _agreed_ that (i) other than in the case of
_Section 5.6_, disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the
Parent Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any
other section or subsection to which the relevance of such item is reasonably
apparent and (ii) no disclosure contained in the Parent SEC Documents shall
be deemed to qualify, modify or apply to _Sections 5.2_ , _5.3_ and _5.6_ ),
Parent and Merger Sub each hereby represents and warrants to the Company as
follows:

 

5.1 _Corporate Organization_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the requisite corporate power
and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted, except, where the failure to be so
incorporated, existing or in good standing or to have such power and authority
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the
other Transactions. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business 

 



40  conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, individually or
in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent
or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or the other Transactions. The copies
of (i) Parents Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and By-
Laws, as amended, in each case most recently filed with the Parent SEC
Documents and (ii) Merger Subs articles of incorporation and by-laws made
available to the Company, are complete and correct copies of such documents as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

 

5.2 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of
500,000,000 Parent Shares. As of October 22, 2013, (x) 242,958,388 Parent
Shares were issued and outstanding, and (y) 61,214,654 Parent Shares were held
in Parents treasury. Other than 7,936,742 Parent Shares reserved for issuance
under the Parent Equity Plans, Parent has no Parent Shares reserved for
issuance. All of the issued and outstanding Parent Shares have been, and all
of the Parent Shares to be issued pursuant to the Merger will be when issued,
duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and
not issued in violation of any preemptive rights or rights of first refusal
created by Law, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Parent or any
Contract to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it
or its assets are bound. The Parent Shares constitute all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Parent. Except as set forth above, there are no
outstanding preemptive or other outstanding rights, obligations,
subscriptions, options, units, warrants, conversion rights, stock
appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, convertible
securities, calls, commitments or similar derivative securities or agreements,
arrangements or rights of any kind that obligate Parent to purchase or issue
any shares of capital stock or other securities of Parent or any securities
or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving
any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of Parent, and
no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or
outstanding. Upon issuance of any Parent Shares in accordance with the terms
of the Parent Equity Plans, such Parent Shares will be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear of any Liens.

5.3 _Authority_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and in the case of
Parent, the Voting Agreement, and to consummate the Transactions to be
consummated by it, subject, in the case of this Agreement, to approval of this
Agreement by Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, which approval
will be obtained immediately following the execution of this Agreement. No
vote of the holders of capital stock of Parent is necessary in connection with
the consummation of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and the Voting Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Parent and, assuming due and valid authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
Voting Agreement by the other parties thereto, constitutes a valid and
binding obligation, in the case of this Agreement, of each of Parent and
Merger Sub and, in the case of the Voting Agreement, of Parent, enforceable
against each of them in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy
and Equity Exception.

consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions to be

the aggregate, be reasonably expected to prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger or the other Transactions. Parent does not own, directly or indirectly,
any voting interest in any other Person that requires an additional filing by
Parent under the HSR Act.

 

(b) None of the execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub
of this Agreement and, in the case of Parent, the Voting Agreement, and the
consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions to be
consummated by it, and compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with any of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement and in the case of Parent, the
Voting Agreement, will constitute or result in (i) subject to approval by
Parent of this Agreement as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, which approval
will be obtained immediately following the execution of this Agreement, a
breach or violation of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or
by-laws or similar organizational or governing documents of Parent or Merger
Sub, (ii) assuming that the Parent Required Governmental Approvals are
received or made, as the case may be, prior to the Effective Time, a breach

violations, losses of benefits, defaults, events, terminations, rights of
termination or cancellation, right or obligation creations, accelerations or
changes or Lien creations as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be

ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or the other
Transactions.

statements and documents filed or furnished since the Applicable Date and
subsequent to the date of this Agreement, including any amendments thereto,
the " _Parent SEC Documents_ "). Each of the Parent SEC Documents, at the time
of its filing or being furnished, complied, or in the case of any Parent SEC
Document filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this
Agreement, will comply, in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to
the Parent SEC Documents. As of their respective dates, (or, if amended prior
to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such amendment), the Parent
SEC Documents did not, and any Parent SEC Documents filed with or furnished
to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

(b) The consolidated financial statements of Parent included in or
incorporated by reference into the Parent SEC Documents (including the related
notes and schedules) (the " _Parent SEC Financial Statements_ ") have been
prepared, or in the case of Parent SEC Financial Statements (including the
related notes and schedules) filed with or furnished to the SEC after the date
of this Agreement, will be prepared, in accordance with GAAP (except as may be
otherwise indicated therein or in the notes thereto and except, in the case
of unaudited consolidated quarterly statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of
the Exchange Act), applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved,
and (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto or as

respects, the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries for the time periods set forth therein and the consolidated

obligations of any kind or nature required by GAAP to be reflected in a
consolidated balance sheet of Parent or disclosed in the notes thereto, except

under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act. Parents disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that

 



43  information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the management of
Parent as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parents internal control over financial reporting is
effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of

external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of Parent, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of Parent are being

prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of Parents assets that could have a material effect on its financial
statements. Parent has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of

Parents auditors and the Audit Committee of Parents Board of Directors (x)
all significant deficiencies, if any, in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
data and has identified to such auditors and Audit Committee of Parents Board
of Directors any material weaknesses in internal controls over financial
reporting and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries who have a
significant role in Parents internal control over financial reporting.

prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger
Sub to consummate the Merger or the other Transactions.

referred to in clause (C) above, the Company Board determines in good faith

(b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Alternative Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer with respect to a
merger, consolidation, liquidation, recapitalization, reorganization,
business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries and (ii) any acquisition by any Person resulting in,
or proposal or offer to acquire by tender offer, share exchange or in any
manner, directly or indirectly, in one or a series of related transactions,
which if consummated would result in, any Person or group of Persons becoming
the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the total voting power or of any class
of equity securities of the Company or those of any of the Company
Subsidiaries, or 20% or more of the consolidated total assets (including
equity securities of the Company Subsidiaries) of the Company, in each case,
other than the Transactions.

 



52 " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Alternative Proposal for
more than 50% of the assets (on a consolidated basis) of the Company or more
than 50% of the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company
that the Company Board has determined in its good faith judgment (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is
reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into
account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the
Person making the proposal, and if consummated, would result in a transaction
more favorable to the holders of Shares from a financial point of view than
the Transactions (after taking into account any revisions to the terms of the
Transactions that may be proposed by Parent as provided in  _Section
6.3(c)_).

(c) _No Adverse Recommendation Change or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_.
The Company Board and each committee of the Company Board shall not:

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation, or approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable
(or publicly propose to approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable) an
Alternative Proposal; or

 

(ii) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, this
_Section 6.3(c)_ cause or permit the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other
agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement referred to in 
_Section 6.3(a)_ entered into in compliance with _Section 6.3(a)_) (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any Alternative Proposal.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time, but not after, the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the
Company Board may (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify the Company
Recommendation (whether in connection with a Superior Proposal or otherwise),
(B) approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Superior
Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that was not solicited,
initiated, encouraged or knowingly facilitated in material breach of _Section
6.3(a)_ (the actions in clause (A) and (B), an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (C) authorize the Company, subject to complying
with the terms of this _Section 6.3_, to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (a " _Superior
Proposal Agreement_ "), in each case, if and only if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and, in the case of clause (A), an
Intervening Event occurs or the Company Board determines in good faith after
consultation with its financial advisor that the Alternative Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal;  _provided_ that neither the Company nor the
Company Board may take the actions set forth in clause (A) with respect to an
Intervening Event (i) until after at least three (3) Business Days (the "
_Notice Period_ ") following Parents receipt of notice from the Company that
the Company Board intends to take such action and the basis therefor,
including all necessary information under _Section 6.3(f)_ and (ii) unless
the Company negotiates with Parent in good faith during the Notice Period (to
the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to any modifications,
changes or revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
permit the Company Board not to take such action; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that neither the Company nor the Company Board may take the actions set forth
in either

 



53  clause (B) or clause (C), or clause (A) with respect to a Superior Proposal,
unless (i) the Company notifies Parent in writing that it intends to take such
action, attaching the most current version of a Superior Proposal Agreement,
if any, and the terms of the Superior Proposal to such notice, (ii) the
Company negotiates with Parent in good faith during the Notice Period (to the
extent Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to any modifications,
changes or revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
permit the Company Board not to take such actions, and (iii) at the completion
of the Notice Period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel)
after taking into account any modifications, changes or revisions to the terms
of this Agreement or the Transactions proposed by Parent (taking into account
(I) the terms of such offer and (II) the legal, financial, regulatory, timing,
financing, conditionality (i.e., closing conditions) and other aspects of such
offer), that such Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior
Proposal even if such modifications, changes or revisions were to be given
effect; and _provided_ , _further_ , that neither the Company nor the Company
Board may take the action set forth in clause (C) unless the Company, prior
to such termination, pays Parent in immediately available funds any fees
required to be paid pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_. Any material amendment to
any such Superior Proposal will be deemed to be a new Superior Proposal for
purposes of this _Section 6.3_ and the Company shall notify Parent in
writing of such modified Superior Proposal and shall again comply with this
_Section 6.3(c)_.

 

As used in this Agreement, " _Intervening Event_ " means a material event,
development, occurrence or change in circumstances or facts that was not
actually known, appreciated or understood by the Company Board as of the date
of this Agreement, which event, development, occurrence or change becomes
known to the Company Board prior to the Stockholders Meeting;  _provided_ ,
that (i) in no event shall the receipt, existence of or terms of an
Alternative Proposal or any inquiry relating thereto or the consequences
thereof constitute an Intervening Event and (ii) no event,
development, occurrence or change (material or otherwise) with respect to
Parent shall constitute or be taken into account as an Intervening Event
except to the extent such event, development, occurrence or change has had and
continues to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.3_
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Alternative
Proposal, including taking and disclosing to the holders of Shares a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders) or making any "stop look and listen"
communication to the holders of Shares pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to holders of Shares); _provided_
, _however_ , that if such disclosure has the effect of withholding,
withdrawing, qualifying or adversely modifying the Company Recommendation,
such disclosure shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change
and Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in
_Section 8.1(d)(i)_.

(e) _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Alternative Proposal. The Company agrees that it will take the necessary
steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in the first
sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this _Section 6.3_. The
Company also agrees that 

 



54  it will (i) promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring it
or any of the Company Subsidiaries to return or destroy all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any
of the Company Subsidiaries and (ii) enforce and not waive the terms of any
such confidentiality agreement other than the "standstill" provisions of any
such confidentiality agreement.

(f) _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within 24 hours) notify Parent if any inquiries, proposals or offers
(including requests for information) with respect to an Alternative Proposal
are received by, or any discussions or negotiations regarding an
Alternative Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any
of its Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of
such Person and the material terms and conditions thereof (including, if
applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current
basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any
amendments thereto) and the status of any discussions or negotiations with
respect thereto.

6.4 _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the execution of
this Agreement shall be a joint press release reasonably acceptable to Parent
and the Company. Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in effect, none of
the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates shall issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to
the Merger, this Agreement, the Voting Agreement or any of the other
Transactions without the prior written approval of the Company and Parent, as
the case may be, except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement
with a securities exchange or by the request of any Governmental Entity (with
respect to which the disclosing party shall not be required to consult with
the non-disclosing party but shall provide prior notice to the non-disclosing
party of any such public announcements or filings); _provided_ that the
Company shall not be required to obtain the prior written approval of Parent
in connection with any press release or public announcement that the
Company Board has made an Adverse Recommendation Change or resolved to do so
in each case, in compliance with _Section 6.3_.

6.5  _Access to Information_.

(a) Subject to applicable Law, during the period prior to the Effective Time,
upon reasonable written notice from Parent, the Company shall (and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and other Representatives of Parent reasonable access to
executives of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to answer Parents
questions concerning the business, operations and affairs of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries and access, during normal business hours, to the
Companys and each of the Company Subsidiaries employees, properties, books,
contracts, commitments and records, in each case, as reasonably requested by
Parent; _provided_ that Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such
activities in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably or materially with
the business, operations or personnel of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required
to provide access to or to disclose information if such access or disclosure
would in the reasonable judgment of the Company (i) result in the disclosure
of any Trade Secret of any third party or violate a third-party 

 



55  confidentiality obligation if the Company shall have used reasonable
commercial efforts to obtain the consent of any such third party to such
access or disclosure or (ii) in the Companys reasonable judgment, jeopardize
the work product privilege or the attorney-client privilege of the institution
in possession or control of such information or violate any Law.

 

(b) Without limitation of the foregoing, all requests for access shall be made
to such Representatives of the Company as it shall designate, who shall be
solely responsible for coordinating all such requests and access thereunder.

(c) The information provided pursuant to  _Section 6.5(a)_ will be used
solely for the purpose of effecting the Transactions and will be governed by
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

6.6 _Further Assurances; Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use) reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
this Agreement and applicable Laws, to consummate the Transactions as
promptly as reasonably practicable and (ii) to prepare and file as soon as
reasonably practicable all necessary documentation, to effect all necessary
applications, notices, petitions, filings and other documents, and to use
reasonable best efforts to obtain, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
date of this Agreement, all necessary permits, consents, registrations,
permits, approvals and authorizations of all third parties
and/or Governmental Entities necessary or, in Parents or the Companys
reasonable opinion, advisable in connection with consummating the
Transactions, including the Company Required Governmental Approvals and Parent
Required Governmental Approvals; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this Agreement, including this _Section 6.6(a)_ or the "reasonable best
efforts" or other similar standard generally, shall require, or be construed
to (x) require Parent to proffer to, or agree to, or to permit the Company to
proffer to, or agree to, sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or
otherwise encumber or hold separate or agree to sell, divest, lease, license,
transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber before or after the Effective
Time, any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or
interest therein of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
(or to consent to any sale, divestiture, lease, license, transfer,
disposition or other Lien by the Company of any of its assets, licenses,
operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein or to any
agreement by the Company to take any of the foregoing actions) or (y) require
Parent to agree to any material changes (including through a licensing
arrangement) or restriction on, or other impairment of Parents ability to own
or operate, any such assets, licenses, operations, rights, product
lines, businesses or interests therein or Parents ability to vote, transfer,
receive dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with respect to
the stock of the Surviving Corporation, except that Parent acknowledges that
its reasonable best efforts under this _Section 6.6(a)_ include an
obligation that Parent grant a license in respect of, dispose of or hold
separate, or enter into an agreement or commitment to grant a license in
respect of, dispose of or hold separate, assets, licenses, operations,
rights, businesses or interests therein or business product lines of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries in connection with the performance of its
obligations under this _Section 6.6(a)_, if, and only if, all of the
following criteria are satisfied: (A) such

 



56  license, disposal or hold separate (the " _Consent Agreement_ ") is required
or imposed by a Governmental Entity to permit the consummation of the Merger
and the other Transactions under applicable Antitrust Laws and (B) the
assets, licenses, operations, rights, businesses or interests therein or
business product lines of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that
would be divested or held separate or otherwise affected by all Consent
Agreements collectively produced gross revenues in an amount that is less than
five percent (5%) of the gross revenues of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013 (the " _Consent Cap_
"). Parent shall, subject to the Consent Cap and _Section 7.2(d)_, propose,
negotiate, offer to commit to and effect (and if such offer is accepted,
commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise,
the licensing, hold separate or disposition of such assets, licenses,
operations, rights, businesses or interests therein or business product lines
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries so as to enable the Closing to
occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event, not later than the
Outside Date, or if such date is extended pursuant to the terms of _Section
8.1(b)_, the extended Outside Date). Subject to applicable Laws relating to
the exchange of information, Parent shall have the right to direct all
matters with any Governmental Entity consistent with its obligations
hereunder; _provided_ that Parent and the Company shall have the right to
review in advance and, to the extent practicable, each will consult with the
other on and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with,
all of the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions
(including the S-4 Registration Statement). In exercising the foregoing
rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. The Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to consult with each other in advance of any meeting, discussion,
substantive telephone call or conference with the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade Commission (the "
_FTC_ ") or any other Governmental Entity regarding any of the Transactions
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, provide to the other
party the opportunity to attend and/or participate in any such substantive
meeting, discussion, telephone call or conference. The Company and Parent
will cooperate with each other and provide such assistance as the other party
may reasonably request to facilitate the Closing hereunder. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman Act of 1890, the
Clayton Act of 1914, the HSR Act and any other applicable antitrust,
competition, premerger notification or trade regulation Laws.

 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall (i) file all necessary documentation
pursuant to the HSR Act and other applicable Laws, including Antitrust Laws,
with respect to the Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in
any event within fifteen (15) Business Days after the execution of this
Agreement), and, except as set forth in _Section 9.11_, each of the Company
and Parent will bear the cost and expenses of its own filings made pursuant to
this _Section 6.6_, (ii) request early termination of the waiting period with
respect to the Merger under the HSR Act, (iii) in the event that the DOJ, the
FTC or any other Governmental Entity requests additional information pursuant
to any Antitrust Law, negotiate the scope of and respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to such request for additional information and (iv)
subject to _Section 6.6(a)_, resist in good faith, at its own cost and
expense, any assertion by any Governmental Entity that the Transactions
constitute a violation of any Antitrust Law, including by contesting
administratively and in court any adverse determination made by a
Governmental Entity under any applicable Antitrust Law, if such assertion or
determination is reasonably likely to materially delay, impair or prevent the
consummation of the Transactions.

 



57 (c) _Information_. Subject to applicable Law, the Company and Parent each
shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the S-4 Registration Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other Transactions.

(d) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws and as required by any Governmental
Entity and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other
with copies of notices or other communications received by Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any
third party, any Governmental Entity, the NYSE or Nasdaq with respect to the
Merger and the other Transactions. The Company and Parent shall give prompt
notice to the other party of any change, fact or condition that is reasonably
expected to (x) result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material
Adverse Effect, as applicable, or (y) cause any condition to the Merger set
forth in _Article VII_ to be unsatisfied.

6.7 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to, honor and perform in accordance with their terms the Benefit Plans set
forth in _Company Disclosure Schedule 6.7(a)_.

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to, provide each employee of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries with compensation (including base salary or wages and
incentive compensation opportunities) and employee benefits as required by
applicable Law or Contract existing on the date hereof.

(c) Parent agrees that, for the twelve (12) month period immediately following
the Effective Time, the employees of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will be provided with employee benefits under employee benefit
plans that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those currently
provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, (i) credit all
service with the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries (including
service recognized by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for
service with other Persons) as if such service were with Parent, for all
purposes of eligibility, benefits and vesting (other than benefit accrual
under a "defined benefit plan" or for the purposes of qualifying
for subsidized early retirement benefits) under any employee benefit plan,
fringe benefit and paid time off (such as vacation or sick leave) plan, policy
or program applicable to employees of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries after the Closing; _provided_ that no credit shall be given
under retiree medical/life plans, frozen benefit plans, severance benefits or
defined benefit plans, and (ii) waive any waiting period, pre-existing
condition or limitation or exclusion and any

 



58  actively-at-work requirement with respect to employees of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries and their spouses and dependents under any group
health plan or any other welfare benefit plan in all cases only to the same
extent that such service or waiting periods were satisfied under a comparable
plan of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or
arrangement, the Company shall cause to be amended the Benefit Plans to the
extent necessary to provide that no employees of Parent and its other
Subsidiaries shall commence participation therein following the Effective
Time.

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, with respect to all employees of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, the Company and/or any of the Company
Subsidiaries shall be responsible for providing any notices required to be
given and otherwise complying with the WARN Act or similar statutes or
regulations of any jurisdiction relating to any plant closing or mass layoff
(or similar triggering event) caused by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, and Parent shall have no responsibility or liability under the
WARN Act (or any other similar statute or regulation) with respect to such
employees. If Parent determines that an event would trigger WARN Act
obligations (or obligations arising under similar statutes or regulations)
within sixty (60) calendar days following the Effective Time, the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries shall, at Parents request, provide notices
to all employees as are required to be provided under the WARN Act (or any
similar statute or regulation), in a form approved by and as directed by
Parent.

 

(f) During the period from the date hereof to the Closing, the Company shall
provide Parent with reasonable access to employee information and with the
right to interview the employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
in a manner designed to minimize disruption to the operations of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries. The Company agrees to supply any assistance
and information (including initial employment dates, credited service dates,
termination dates, reemployment dates, hours of service, compensation and Tax
withholding history in a form that shall be usable by Parent) as may be
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the foregoing, and such
information shall be true and correct in all material respects.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to provide
access to or to disclose employee information if such access or disclosure
would violate or prejudice the rights of its employees, infringe on
confidentiality obligations, jeopardize the work-product doctrine or
the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of
such information, compromise the value of any Trade Secret, or contravene any
Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement.

 

(g) Prior to the Closing Date, the company which sponsors the Consolidated
Graphics, Incorporated Employee 401(k) Savings Plan that covers employees of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who are not subject to a collective
bargaining agreement (the " _Non-Union 401(k) Plan_ ") shall adopt resolutions
amending the Non-Union 401(k) Plan to provide that no rights to contributions
will accrue after, and that the Non-Union 401(k) Plan will be terminated as
of, the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall
allow Parent to review such resolutions prior to their adoption and
shall reasonably

 



59  cooperate with Parent to make any changes to such resolutions reasonably
requested by Parent. The Company shall take all other actions required or
reasonably advisable to terminate the Non-Union 401(k) Plan prior to the
Closing Date, and shall consult with Parent prior to any such other actions
concerning the termination of the Non-Union 401(k) Plan. The Company shall
instruct the recordkeeper and the applicable Persons responsible for payroll
deductions for contributions to the Non-Union 401(k) Plan to take affirmative
action to prevent contributions to the Non-Union 401(k) Plan with respect to
participants compensation earned after the Non-Union 401(k) Plans
termination even if the payroll cycle does not coincide with the Non-Union
401(k) Plan termination date.

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
the terms and conditions of employment, including compensation and benefits,
applicable to any employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries who is
covered by a Company Labor Agreement shall be governed by the terms of the
applicable Company Labor Agreement and applicable labor Law.

(i) For each Company Equity Plan, Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change
of control" or "change in control" within the meaning of each such Company
Equity Plan or related Company Stock Option will occur upon the Effective
Time.

 

(j) The parties agree to the matters set forth on _Company Disclosure Schedule
6.7(j)_.

 

(k) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be
treated as an amendment of any particular Benefit Plan, (ii) give any third
party any right to enforce the provisions of this _Section 6.7_ or (iii)
obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to (x)
maintain any particular benefit plan or (y) retain the employment of any
particular employee.

6.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to), indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent authorized or permitted under the TBOC or other applicable Law
and its articles of incorporation, by-laws or similar organizational or
governing documents, each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to
the date of this Agreement or who becomes such prior to the Effective Time, an
officer or director of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
(individually, an " _Indemnified Party_ ", and collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any and all losses, claims, damages, costs,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements), obligations
(including experts fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript
fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications,
postage and courier charges), fines, liabilities and judgments (collectively,
" _Indemnified Liabilities_ "), paid or incurred in connection with
investigating, defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise
participating in (and including preparation for any of the foregoing) any
pending, threatened, asserted or completed claim, action, suit, proceeding,
inquiry or investigation (including any action or brought by an Indemnified
Party to enforce any rights under this _Section 6.8_), any action on appeal,
or any arbitration or other alternative dispute 

 



60  resolution mechanism), whether civil or criminal, and whether instituted by
the Company, the Surviving Corporation, any Governmental Entity or any other
Person (each, a " _Proceeding_ "), based on, arising out of or in connection
with (i) the fact that such Person is or was an officer or director of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (or served at the request of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director or officer of another Person
(including any employee benefit plan)) or (ii) matters occurring or existing
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after, the Effective Time, INCLUDING INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES ARISING FROM THE
SOLE NEGLIGENCE OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY. Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, promptly advance all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses of each Indemnified Party in connection with any Proceeding as such
expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements) are incurred upon
receipt from such Indemnified Party of a request therefor (accompanied by
invoices or other relevant documentation); _provided_ that such Indemnified
Party undertakes to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under the TBOC or other
applicable Law with respect to such Proceeding. In the event any Proceeding
is brought against any Indemnified Party (and in which indemnification could
be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense of such matter and
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified
Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects
not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that
there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent or the
Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties
may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; _provided_
that (i) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to
this _Section 6.8(a)_ to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified
Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such
Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest;
_provided_ that the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of
interest shall be used; (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the
defense of any such matter; and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their prior written
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned);
and _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court
of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party
in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims
period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO
Insurance_") with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the
Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement
or the Transactions); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
Company expend for such policies

 



61  an aggregate premium amount in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the
aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company prior to the date
hereof to maintain the DandO Insurance. If the Company and the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of
at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in
place as of the date of this Agreement with benefits and levels of coverage at
least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the
date of this Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase
comparable DandO Insurance for such six (6)-year period with benefits and
levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for
such policies an annual premium amount in excess of three hundred percent
(300%) of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such
insurance; and, _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain
a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount.

 

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and
perform in accordance with their terms all indemnification agreements in
effect as of the date of this Agreement between the Company, on the one hand,
and any director or officer of the Company, on the other hand.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party (and his or
her heirs and personal representatives), (ii) shall survive the consummation
of the Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Party without the consent of such
Indemnified Party and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may
have, whether pursuant to Law, Contract, any Benefit Plan, the Company
Articles or Company By-Laws (or comparable organizational documents of the
Company Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation), or otherwise.

(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or permitted assigns (each, an " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of such Indemnifying Party assume all
obligations of such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 6.8_.

6.9  _Defense of Litigation_. The Company shall provide Parent with prompt
notice of and copies of all Legal Proceedings and correspondence relating to
any Legal Proceeding brought, or to the Companys Knowledge, threatened,
against the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors or officers arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the Transactions. The Company shall consult with Parent and give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense of any such Legal Proceeding;
_provided_ , _however_ , that

 



62  neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall settle or offer to
settle any such Legal Proceeding without the prior written consent of Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

6.10 _State Takeover Statutes_. If any State "fair price," "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition" or similar anti-takeover statute or Law is or may
become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions, the
Company and the Company Board shall, subject to applicable Law, (a) grant such
approvals and take all actions as are necessary to ensure that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such takeover statute or Law on such
transactions.

6.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Shares (including derivative securities with respect to
Shares) or acquisitions of Parent Shares resulting from the Transactions by
each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

6.12 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the
delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from the NYSE and
the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time.

6.13 _Listing of Parent Shares_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Parent Shares to be issued as part of the Per Share Merger
Consideration to be listed on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance.

 

6.14 _Financing_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Closing is not conditioned
upon Parent obtaining any financing.

Date as though made on and as of such date and time (except for
representations and warranties that expressly speak only as of a specific
date or time, which need only be true and correct as of such other date or

8.1 _Termination_. Anything herein or elsewhere to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may

(b) By either the Company or Parent: (i) if any Governmental Entity shall have
issued a Final Judgment prohibiting, restraining or making illegal the

has not been satisfied or waived on or prior to such date, but all other
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ have been satisfied or waived (except

Closing), then the Outside Date may be extended by Parent or the Company by
written notice delivered to the other party to a date not beyond October 23,
2014 (which date shall then be the Outside Date); or (iii) if the
Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been

 



65  obtained at the Stockholders Meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof taken in accordance with this Agreement; _provided_ that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be
available to any party that has breached in any material respect its
obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have proximately
contributed to the occurrence of the failure of a condition to the
consummation of the Merger.

(c) By the Company, (i) if the Company enters into a Superior Proposal
Agreement;  _provided_ that the applicable provisions of _Section 6.3_ have
been complied with in all material respects by the Company and simultaneously
with such termination, the Company pays Parent the Termination Fee pursuant
to  _Section 8.3(b)_ or (ii) there has been a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Parent or Merger Sub in this
Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall have become untrue
after the date of this Agreement such that _Section 7.3(a)_ or _7.3(b)_
would not be satisfied and such breach or condition is not curable or, if
curable, is not cured within the earlier of (x) thirty (30) calendar days
after written notice thereof is given by the Company to the Parent and (y)
the Outside Date.

(d) By Parent, (i) if the Company Board shall have made any Adverse
Recommendation Change; (ii) the Company shall have failed to take a vote of
holders of Shares to approve this Agreement and the Merger prior to the

this Agreement, such that _Section 7.2(a)_ or _7.2(b)_ would not be satisfied
and such breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, is not cured
within the earlier of (x) thirty (30) calendar days after written notice
thereof is given by Parent to the Company and (y) the Outside Date.

 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. The party desiring to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1_ shall deliver written notice (pursuant to _Section
9.4_) of such termination to the other party or parties specifying the

applicable), _Article IX_ and the applicable definitional provisions of
_Article I_ (and any other definitions of terms contained in any such Sections
or Articles under this Agreement), which shall survive any termination of
this Agreement) shall immediately become null and void, and there shall be no
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company under
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the parties shall be
relieved from liability or damages for any willful material breach of this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive any termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms set
forth therein. 

8.3 _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) The Company shall pay to Parent the amount of $15,000,000 in cash (the "
_Termination Fee_ ") in the event that this Agreement is terminated:

66 (ii) (x) (A) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_
or  _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, or (B) by Parent pursuant to _Section

Alternative Proposal shall have been made to the Company Board, the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any holders of Shares or any Person
shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to
make an Alternative Proposal with respect to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement but prior to such termination
(and such Alternative Proposal or publicly announced intention shall not have

termination pursuant to  _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_, at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Outside Date, (B) with respect to any termination pursuant
to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date
of the Stockholders Meeting, including any postponement or adjournment
thereof and (C) with respect to any termination pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_, _Section 8.1(d)(iii)_ or _Section 8.1(d)(iv)_, at least
ten (10) Business Days prior to such termination; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such Alternative Proposal or publicly announced intention shall be
deemed to be publicly and unconditionally withdrawn for purposes of this 
_Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ if, within twelve (12) months of any such termination,
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries enters into a binding written
agreement with respect to, or shall have consummated, or shall have approved
or recommended to the holders of Shares, any Alternative Proposal with any
Person (or its Affiliates) that made an Alternative Proposal or publicly
announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Alternative
Proposal prior to such termination) and (z) within twelve (12) months of any
such termination, (1) the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries shall
have entered into a binding written agreement with respect to, or shall have
consummated, or shall have approved or recommended to the holders of Shares,
an Alternative Proposal or (2) there shall have been consummated an
Alternative Proposal (substituting in each instance "50%" for "20%" in the
definition of Alternative Proposal); or

(iii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_.

 

(b) The Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee, by wire transfer of same
day funds, (i) in the case of  _Section 8.3(a)(i)_, no later than two (2)
Business Days after the date of such termination, (ii) in the case of _Section
8.3(a)(ii)_, on or prior to the first date on which the Company takes any such
action referred to in clause (z) of _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ with respect to an
Alternative Proposal and (iii) in the case of _Section 8.3(a)(iii)_, prior to
or concurrently with, and as a condition to, such termination. In
addition, (x) in the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_, by the Company or Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_, the
Company shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) after
such termination, or (y) in the event that this Agreement was terminated by
the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ and the Termination
Fee becomes payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_, the Company shall
simultaneously with the payment of the Termination Fee, pay Parent all of the
documented out-of-pocket expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent,
incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby up to a maximum amount of $3,000,000, by wire
transfer of same day funds (such amount, the " _Expense Payment_ "). Except to
the extent required by applicable Law, the Company shall not withhold any
withholding taxes from any payment made pursuant to this _Section 8.3_.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and
Merger Sub agree that payment of the Termination Fee and any subsequent
obligation of the Company to pay the

 



67  Expense Payment pursuant to this _Section 8.3(b)_, if such payments are
payable and actually paid, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for monetary
damages of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement. Under no circumstances
shall the Termination Fee or the Expense Payment be payable more than once.
The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_
are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements,
Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the
Company fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_,
and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit
that results in a judgment against the Company for such payment or any portion
of such payment, the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub its costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together
with interest on the amount of the payment at the prime rate of Citibank N.A.
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of
payment.

hereto by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors
at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that after
the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, no amendment, modification or
supplement shall be made that changes the consideration payable in the Merger
or adversely affects the rights of the holders of Shares under this Agreement
or that otherwise requires further approval of holders of Shares under

way be affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon such determination that any
term, provision, covenant or restriction is invalid, illegal, void,
unenforceable or against regulatory policy, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in
order that the Transactions are consummated as originally contemplated to the
greatest extent possible.

9.8 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE

written consent of the other parties hereto. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Any purported assignment in violation of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be null and void _ab_ _initio_.

construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the information set forth in the
Company Disclosure Schedules and the Parent Disclosure Schedules, and the
dollar thresholds set forth in this Agreement, shall not be used as a basis
for interpreting the terms "material", "Company Material Adverse Effect" or
"Parent Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement.

of the Covered Shares and (ii) to agree to all of the matters set forth in

clear of any Liens whatsoever with respect to the ownership, Transfer or
voting of the Existing Shares, except for any such Liens and restrictions
arising hereunder and except for Transfer restrictions of general
applicability under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and state "blue

change of any rights or obligations of any party or the creation of any Lien
upon any of the Covered Shares under, any Contract that is binding on the
Shareholder or any of his properties or assets, or (ii) violate any
Laws applicable to the Shareholder or by which any of the Shareholders
assets or properties is bound, except for any of the foregoing as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, impair the ability of the Shareholder to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

consents and approvals as may be required under securities Laws and antitrust
or competition Laws (including the HSR Act), the execution and delivery of

make any filing or registration with or declaration or notification to, any
Governmental Entity, except where the failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings, registrations,
declarations or notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate,

contemplated hereby.

actual knowledge, there is no Legal Proceeding or Judgment in effect, pending
or threatened against the Shareholder before or by any Governmental Entity

by this Agreement and has, independently and without reliance upon any of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company and based on such information as the
Shareholder has deemed appropriate, made his own analysis and decision to
enter into this Agreement. The Shareholder acknowledges that none of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company has made or is making any representation or

character except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE IV

or any other interest specifically therein (including by tendering into any
tender or exchange offer by any Person other than Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries), (ii) enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding
with any Person (other than Parent or Merger Sub), or take any other action

over such Covered Shares and the recipient of such Covered Shares executes
and delivers a joinder to this Agreement whereby such recipient becomes bound
by the terms of this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ , that from and
after the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Shareholder
may Transfer Covered Shares in such amounts as are necessary for the
withholding of Taxes with respect to the settlement of any Company Stock
Options or other awards under the Company Equity Plans. Any purported
Transfer of the Covered Shares in violation of this _Section 4.1_ shall be
null and void _ab_ _initio_. Promptly following the date hereof, (i) the

distribution, or any change in the Shares by reason of any split-up, reverse
stock split, recapitalization, combination, reclassification, exchange of
Shares or the like, the terms "Existing Shares" and "Covered Shares" shall be
deemed to refer to and include such Shares as well as all such stock splits,
dividends and distributions and any securities into which or for which any or
all of such Shares may be changed or exchanged or which are received in such
transaction.

 

4.3. _No Solicitation_. The Shareholder hereby agrees that during the term of
this Agreement, he shall not, and he shall instruct and use his reasonable
best efforts to cause his controlled Affiliates and Representatives not to:
(i) initiate, solicit, seek, encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries
or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Alternative Proposal, (ii) make or
participate in, directly or indirectly, a "solicitation" of "proxies" (as such
terms are used in the rules of the SEC) or powers of attorney or similar
rights to vote, or seek to advise or influence any Person with respect to the
voting of, any Shares in connection with any vote or other action on any of
the Section 2.1(b) Matters, other than to recommend that the holders of Shares
vote in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement, (iii) furnish any
information regarding the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to any

Alternative Proposal or any proposal, inquiry or offer that could reasonably
be expected to lead to an Alternative Proposal, (iv) engage in, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
provide any non-public information or data to any Person relating to, any

or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative
Proposal, (vii) enter into any letter of intent or agreement in principle or
any Contract providing for, relating to or in connection with any Alternative
Proposal or any proposal, inquiry or offer that could reasonably be expected
to lead to an Alternative Proposal or (viii) otherwise facilitate knowingly
any effort or attempt to make an Alternative Proposal, in each case except to
the extent that at such time the Company is permitted to take such action
pursuant to the Merger Agreement (but subject to the same restrictions
applicable to the Company with respect to the

 



6  taking of such action under the Merger Agreement). Immediately following the
execution hereof, the Shareholder shall, and shall instruct and use his
reasonable best efforts to cause his controlled Affiliates and
Representatives to, immediately cease all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any
Alternative Proposal, or any proposal, inquiry or offer that could reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. For avoidance of doubt, the
Shareholder shall have no obligation with respect to and shall have no
responsibility hereunder with respect to any action taken or omission by the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives.

4.4. _Notice of Acquisitions_. The Shareholder hereby agrees to notify Parent

accounting of every nature and kind whatsoever, known or unknown, suspected
or unsuspected (each, a " _Claim_ " and collectively, the " _Claims_ ") that
has arisen or arises directly out of the Shareholders interest as a holder of
Shares or a shareholder of any of the Company Subsidiaries through the
Effective Time, including Claims relating to, in connection with or arising
from the Merger Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions, the due
authorization and execution and fairness (to the Shareholder and otherwise)
of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions and the amount,
allocation and distribution of the Per Share Merger Consideration, as
applicable, in each case, other than the right to receive the Per Share Stock
Option Consideration and the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with
the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Shareholder does
not release or waive any rights or Claims of the Shareholder arising out of
or pursuant to: (i) this Agreement; (ii) Section 6.8 (Indemnification and
Insurance) of the Merger Agreement; (iii) any DandO policies or articles
of incorporation/formation, bylaws or other governing documents of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries providing indemnification or DandO insurance
rights to the Shareholder; (iv) the Indemnification Agreement dated October
14, 2013 between the Shareholder and the Company; (v) the Amended and
Restated Employment Agreement dated May 22, 2008, as amended, between the
Shareholder and the Company; (vi) the Consulting Agreement to be entered into
as contemplated in  _Section 4.11_ below; and (vii) the Annual Incentive
Award Agreement dated May 23, 2013 between the Company and the Shareholder.
For the avoidance of doubt, the waiver contained in this _Section 4.5_ shall
be absolute and perpetual, and shall not have any effect until the Effective
Time.

4.6. _Non-Compete_.

 

(a) The Shareholder hereby agrees that, for a period of three (3) years after
the Closing Date, he shall not, directly or indirectly, on behalf of himself
or any other Person: (i) engage as a stockholder, employee, director, officer,
consultant or otherwise in or of a business

 



7  that sells or otherwise provides printing and/or print-related services (the
" _Business_ "), in the U.S. or, with respect to any geographic area outside
of the U.S., only in those geographic areas in which the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries conduct operations as of the Closing Date
(the " _Specified Territory_ "); _provided_ that the foregoing restriction
shall not be deemed to apply to the Shareholders passive ownership of
securities representing not more than 1% of the outstanding voting power of
any entity the equity securities of which are listed on a national securities
exchange, except in the case of Parent, in which case the Shareholders
ownership shall not be restricted; (ii) render financial assistance to or
receive any economic benefit from any Person that engages or could be
reasonably expected to engage in the Business in the Specified
Territory, other than Parent and its Affiliates, including the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries; (iii) (x) induce or solicit any customer,
supplier or agent of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as of the
Closing Date, to terminate or curtail any existing business or commercial
relationship with the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or with
Parent or any of its other Affiliates or (y) otherwise interfere with the
relationship of Parent or any of its Affiliates, including the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, with any such customer, supplier or agent;
and (iv) solicit, induce, recruit, offer employment to, hire or take any other
action intended to have the effect of causing any Person who was an employee
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as of the date of this
Agreement or as of the Closing Date to terminate his or her employment.

 

(b) The parties acknowledge and agree that the restrictions contained in this
_Section 4.6_ are reasonable (including as to scope, time and area), not
unduly restrictive of the Shareholders rights, supported by adequate
consideration and necessary protection of the immediate interests of Parent,
and any violation of these restrictions would cause immediate and
irreparable injury to Parent for which there would be no adequate monetary
damages. In the event of a breach or a threatened breach by the Shareholder of
these restrictions, the Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that Parent will
be entitled to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for an injunction
restraining the Shareholder from such breach or threatened breach, in addition
to any other remedy to which Parent may be entitled at law or in equity
without the requirement of posting bond. In addition, the parties acknowledge
and agree that the restrictions contained in this _Section 4.6_ are essential
elements of the Merger Agreement and that but for these restrictions, Parent
would not have agreed to enter into the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, and the Shareholder agrees not to challenge the validity
or importance of the restrictions contained in this _Section 4.6_. The
covenants contained in this _Section 4.6_ shall be deemed to apply to each
State of the United States of America, each county within each State of the
United States of America, each foreign country and each other geographic area
separately, not collectively, and shall be severable as to each such State of
the United States of America, county, each foreign country or other geographic
area. If any court determines that any provision of this _Section 4.6_ is
unenforceable, such court will have the power to reduce the duration or
scope of such provision, as the case may be, or terminate such provision
until, in such reduced form, such provision shall be enforceable. It is the
intention of the parties hereto that the foregoing restrictions shall not be
terminated, unless so terminated by a court, but shall be deemed amended to
the extent required to render them valid and enforceable, such amendment to
apply only with respect to the operation of this _Section 4.6_ in the
jurisdiction of the court that has made the adjudication.

 



8 4.7. _Waiver of Appraisal Rights_. The Shareholder hereby unconditionally
waives, and agrees not to exercise, assert or perfect, any rights of
appraisal or any dissenters rights that the Shareholder may have (whether
under applicable Law or otherwise) or could potentially have or acquire in
connection with the Merger.

 

4.8. _Further Assurances_. From time to time, at Parents reasonable request,
the Shareholder shall execute and deliver such additional documents and take
all such further reasonable action as may be necessary to effectuate the
intent of this Agreement.

4.9.  _Company Agreement_. The Company hereby acknowledges the restrictions
on Transfers of Covered Shares contained in _Section 4.1_. The Company agrees
(i) not to register the Transfer of any certificated or uncertificated
interest representing any Covered Shares without the prior written consent of
Parent and (ii) to take all such other actions reasonably necessary in
furtherance of the Shareholders commitments hereunder, including (to the
extent reasonably within the Companys power) prohibiting or refusing to give
effect to any action in violation hereof.

4.10. _Public Announcement_. The initial press release regarding the Merger
shall be a joint press release of Parent and the Company, and thereafter, so
long as the Merger Agreement is in effect, none of the Shareholder, the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates shall issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or make any filings
with any third party or Governmental Entity without the prior
written approval of the other parties, except as may be required by Law or by
any listing agreement with a securities exchange or by the request of any
Governmental Entity (with respect to which the disclosing party shall not be
required to consult with the non-disclosing party but shall provide prior
notice to the non-disclosing party of any such public announcements or
filings), _it_ _being_ _understood_ _and_ _agreed_ that the Shareholder hereby
authorizes Parent and the Company to disclose in any reports required to be
filed under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, including any report on
Form 8-K or any Schedule 13D, if applicable, and any other applicable Laws,
this Agreement and the information contained herein.

4.11. _Consulting Agreement_. In consideration of the Shareholders agreement
to abide by the terms of Section _4.5_ and _4.6_ above, Parent shall engage
the Shareholder as a consultant to Parent for a term of three (3) years from
the Effective Time, for a consulting fee of $200,000 per annum, for no more
than ten (10) hours per week, and on such other terms as the parties may
mutually agree. The parties agree to negotiate the terms thereof in good faith
and enter into such agreement as soon as reasonably practicable following the
date hereof.

12  failure to lawfully serve process, (ii) that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of such court or from any legal process commenced in
such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) that (x) such action, suit or proceeding in any such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of such action, suit
or proceeding is improper and (z) this Agreement, the transactions

enforced in or by such courts.

 

(c) Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that any CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY

5.9. _Remedies_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur

accordance with the terms hereof or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly
agreed that, subject to the provisions of this _Section 5.9_, the parties
hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches

unenforceable, invalid or contrary to law.

5.10. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to
be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants 

 



13  and restrictions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force
and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon such
determination that any term, provision, covenant or restriction is invalid,
illegal, void, unenforceable or against regulatory policy, the parties hereto

written consent of the other parties hereto. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Any purported assignment in violation of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be null and void ab initio.

 

5.12. _Shareholder Capacity_. The Shareholder is entering into this Agreement
solely in his, her or its capacity as the Beneficial Owner of Shares, and, if
applicable, not the Shareholders capacity as a director or officer of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Accordingly, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing herein shall
in any way (a) restrict or limit the Shareholder from taking (or omitting to
take) any action in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the
Company taken in order to fulfill his or her fiduciary obligations under
applicable Law or (b) restrict or limit (or require the Shareholder to
attempt to restrict or limit) the Shareholder from acting in such capacity or
voting in such capacity in the good faith exercise of his or her fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
hereto acknowledge that the directors and officers of the Company are
restricted in the manner set forth in the Merger Agreement.

FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED BY-LAWS

 

of

CONSOLIDATED GRAPHICS, INC.

Effective as of []

 

ARTICLE I

SHAREHOLDERS

 

Section 1\. _Annual Meeting_. The annual meeting of shareholders for the
purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of any other business
to properly come before such meeting shall be held on such date in each year
and at such time as shall be designated by the Board of Directors and stated
in the notice (or any supplement thereto) of the meeting.

 

Section 2\. _Presiding Officer_.

 

(a) The Board of Directors shall appoint, from time to time, a director or an
officer of the Corporation who shall preside at all meetings of the
shareholders and shall serve as Chairman of such meetings.

(b) The Board of Directors shall appoint, from time to time, at least two (2)
persons to act as inspectors of election at the meeting.

(c) Subject to the following, annual and special meetings of shareholders
generally shall follow accepted rules of practice and procedure for the
orderly conduct of shareholder meetings:

 

(i) The Chairman of the meeting shall have absolute authority and shall make
the final decision over matters of procedure and on any motion or question to
come before such meeting and there shall be no appeal from the ruling of the
Chairman.

(ii) If disorder should arise which prevents continuation of the legitimate
business of the meeting, the Chairman may quit the chair and announce the
adjournment of the meeting; and upon the Chairman so doing, the meeting shall
be immediately adjourned. 

(iii) The Chairman may ask or require anyone not a bona fide shareholder or
proxy entitled to vote thereat to leave the meeting.

(d) At the annual meeting of the shareholders, only such business shall be
conducted as shall have been properly brought before the annual meeting. To
be properly brought before the annual meeting of shareholders, business must
be (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by
or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) brought before the
meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors pursuant to
resolution duly adopted with respect thereto. Section 3\. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the shareholders, for any
purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute, may be called by
a majority of the Board of Directors, and shall be called by the President at
the request of the holders of not less than one-half (1/2) of all the
outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting.

Section 4\. _Place of Meeting_. The Board of Directors may designate any
place, either within or without the State of Texas, as the place of meeting
for any annual or special meeting. If no designation is made, the place of
meeting shall be the registered office of the Corporation in the State of
Texas.

 

Section 5\. _Notice of Meeting_. Written or printed notice stating the place,
day and hour of the meeting and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting
is called, shall be delivered not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60)
days before the date of the meeting, either personally or by mail, by or at
the direction of the President or the Secretary, or the officer or persons
calling the meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such
meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited
in the United States mail, addressed to the shareholder at his or her address
as it appears on the stock transfer books of the Corporation, with postage
thereon prepaid. Waiver by a shareholder in writing of notice of a
shareholders meeting, signed by such shareholder, whether before or after the
time of such meeting, shall be equivalent to the giving of such notice.
Attendance by a shareholder, whether in person or by proxy, at a shareholders
meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting of which the
shareholder did not receive proper notice.

 

Section 6\. _Closing of Transfer Books and Fixing of Record Date_. For the
purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any
meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or shareholders entitled
to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of
shareholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors of
the Corporation may provide that the stock transfer books shall be closed for
a stated period but not to exceed, in any case, sixty (60) days. If the stock
transfer books shall be closed for the purpose of determining shareholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, such books
shall be closed for at least ten (10) days immediately preceding such meeting.
In lieu of closing the stock transfer books, the Board of Directors may, by
resolution, fix in advance a date as the record date for any such
determination of shareholders, such date in any case to be not more than sixty
(60) days and, in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than ten (10)
days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such
determination of shareholders, is to be taken. If the stock transfer books are
not closed and no record date is fixed for the determination of shareholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, or
shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend, the date on which
notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the
Board of Directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be,
shall be the record date for such determination of shareholders. When a
determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders
has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall apply to
any adjournment thereof except where the determination has been made through
the closing of the stock transfer books and the stated period of closing has
expired.

 



-2- Section 7\. _Voting Lists_. The officer or agent having charge of the stock
transfer books for shares of the Corporation shall make, at least ten (10)
days before each meeting of shareholders, a complete list of the shareholders
entitled to vote at such meeting, or any adjournment thereof, arranged in
alphabetical order, with the address and the number of shares held by each,
which list, for a period of ten (10) days prior to such meeting, shall be kept
on file at the registered office of the Corporation and shall be subject to
inspection by any shareholder at any time during usual business hours. Such
list shall also be produced and opened at the time and place of the meeting
and shall be subject to the inspection by any shareholder during the whole
time of the meeting. The original stock transfer books shall be _prima facie_
evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to examine such list or
transfer books or to vote at any meeting of shareholders. Failure to comply
with the requirements of this Section shall not affect the validity of any
action taken at such meeting.

Section 8\. _Quorum and Vote Required for Action_. A majority of the
outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote, represented in person
or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of shareholders and the
vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote and thus
represented at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the
shareholders meeting, unless the vote of a greater number is required by law,
the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws. If less
than a majority of the outstanding shares are represented at a meeting, a
majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to
time without further notice. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall
be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have
been transacted as originally notified. The shareholders present at a duly
organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment,
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a
quorum.

 

Section 9\. _Proxies_. At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder may vote
by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by his or her duly
authorized attorney-in-fact. Such proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of
the Corporation before or at the time of the meeting. No proxy shall be valid
after eleven (11) months from the date of its execution, unless
otherwise provided in the proxy. Each proxy shall be revocable unless
expressly provided therein to be irrevocable, and unless otherwise made
irrevocable by law.

 

Section 10\. _Vote of Each Share_. Each outstanding share entitled to vote
shall be entitled to one (1) vote upon each matter submitted to vote at a
meeting of shareholders.

Section 11\. _Cumulative Voting_. There shall be no cumulative voting
whatsoever permitted on any matter.

Section 12\. _Action by Shareholders without Meeting_. Any action required to
be taken at a meeting of the shareholders, or any other action which may be
taken at a meeting of the shareholders, may be taken without a meeting if a
consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by all
of the shareholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter
thereof.

 



-3- ARTICLE II

 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

 

Section 1\. _General Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed by its Board of Directors.

 

Section 2\. _Number, Qualifications and Term_. The number of directors which
shall constitute the whole board shall be two (2) unless otherwise determined
from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors, but shall
never be less than one (1). No decrease in the number of directors shall
shorten the term of any incumbent director. Directors need not be
shareholders of the Corporation or residents of Texas. Each person elected a
director shall hold office until such directors successor is duly elected and
qualified or until such directors earlier resignation or removal.

 

Section 3\. _Secretary_. The Secretary of the Board of Directors shall be the
Secretary of the Corporation, and the Secretary shall act as Secretary of the
Directors meetings and record the minutes of all such meetings. If the
Secretary of the Corporation is not available, then the Chief Operating
Officer may appoint a person to serve as Secretary of the meeting, and
such person shall not be required to be a member of the Board of Directors
nor an officer of the Corporation.

Section 4\. _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors
shall be held at such place or places within or without the State of Texas, at
such hour and on such day as may be fixed by resolution of the Board of
Directors, without further notice of such meetings. The time or place of
holding regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be changed by any
director by giving written notice thereof as provided in Section 7 of this
Article II.

 

Section 5\. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may
be called by or at the request of the President or a majority of the
Directors. The person or persons authorized to call special meetings of the
Board of Directors may fix any place, either within or without the State of
Texas, as the place for holding any special meeting of the Board of
Directors called by them.

Section 6\. _Notice_. Notice of any special meetings shall be given at least
two (2) days previously thereto by a written notice delivered personally,
mailed or sent by telecopy to each director at his or her business address, or
by telegram. If the special meeting is not held solely or in part by using a
conference telephone or other communications system authorized by Section
6.002 of the Texas Business Organizations Code ("TBOC"), the notice shall
specify the location of the special meeting. If the special meeting is held
solely or in part by using a conference telephone or other communications
system authorized by Section 6.002 of the TBOC, the form of communications
system to be used for the special meeting and the means for accessing the
communications system must be stated in the notice. If mailed, such notice
shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail so
addressed, with postage thereon prepaid. If notice be given by telegram, such
notice shall be deemed to be delivered when the telegram is delivered to the
telegraph company. If notice be given by facsimile or electronic message, such
notice shall be deemed to be delivered upon successful transmission of such
notice. Any director

 



-4-  may waive notice of any meeting. The attendance of a director at a meeting
shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director
attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of
any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither
the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special
meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice or waiver
of notice of such meeting.

Section 7\. _Quorum_. A majority of the number of directors fixed by these By-
Laws shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting
of the Board of Directors, but if less than such majority is present at a
meeting, a majority of the directors present may adjourn the meeting from time
to time without further notice.

Section 8\. _Manner of Acting_. The act of the majority of the directors
present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the
Board of Directors.

Section 9\. _Vacancies_. Any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors
may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining
directors then in office though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining
director. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the
unexpired term of his or her predecessor in office.

A vacancy shall be deemed to exist by reason of the death, resignation,
failure or refusal to act by the person elected, upon the failure of
shareholders to elect directors at any annual meeting of shareholders, upon
the failure of shareholders to elect directors to fill the unexpired term of
directors removed in accordance with the provisions of these By-Laws, or upon
an increase in the number of directors by amendment of these By-Laws.

Section 10\. _Removal_. At any meeting of shareholders called expressly for
that purpose, any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed,
with or without cause, by a vote of the holders of a majority of the shares
then entitled to vote on the election of directors. If the entire Board of
Directors or any one (1) or more of the directors is removed, new directors
may be elected at the same meeting for the unexpired term of the director or
directors so removed. Failure to elect directors to fill the unexpired
term of the director or the directors so removed for cause shall be deemed to
create a vacancy or vacancies in the Board of Directors.

 

Section 11\. _Compensation_. By resolution of the Board of Directors, the
directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting
of the Board of Directors, and may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at each
meeting of the Board of Directors or a stated salary as director. No such
payment shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any
other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

Section 12\. _Presumption of Assent_. A director of the Corporation who is
present at a meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof in
which action on any Corporation matter is taken shall be presumed to have
assented to the action taken unless such directors dissent shall be entered
in the minutes of the meeting or unless such director shall file his or her
written dissent to such action with the person acting as the Secretary of the
meeting before the adjournment thereof, or shall forward such dissent by
registered mail to the Secretary of the Corporation immediately after the
adjournment of the meeting. Such right to have a dissent entered into the
minutes or to file a written dissent shall not apply to a director who voted
in favor of such action or abstained from voting.

 



-5- Section 13\. _Interest of Directors in Contracts_. Any contract or other
transaction between the Corporation and one (1) or more of its directors, or
between the Corporation and any firm of which one (1) or more if its directors
are members or employees, or in which they are interested, or between the
Corporation and any corporation or association of which one (1) or more of
its directors are shareholders, members, directors, officers, or employees, or
in which they are interested, shall be valid for all purposes, notwithstanding
the presence of such director or directors at the meeting of the Board of
Directors of the Corporation, which acts upon, or in reference to, such
contract or transaction, and notwithstanding his or her or their participation
in such action, if the fact of such interest shall be disclosed or known to
the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors shall, nevertheless,
authorize, approve and ratify such contract or transaction by a vote of a
majority of the directors present, such interested director or directors to
be counted in determining whether a quorum is present, but not to be counted
in calculating the majority of such quorum necessary to carry such vote. This
section shall not be construed to invalidate any contract or other transaction
which would otherwise be valid under the common and statutory law applicable
thereto.

Section 14\. _Committees_. The Board of Directors may, by resolution or
resolutions passed by a majority of the Board of Directors, constitute one (1)
or more committees of the Board, which shall in each case consist of such
number of directors as the Board of Directors may determine or as may
be required by applicable law. Each committee shall have and may exercise
such powers in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation
as the Board of Directors may determine by resolution and specify in the
respective resolutions appointing them or in any charters adopted therefor,
subject to such restrictions as may be contained in the Amended and Restated
Articles of Incorporation or that may be imposed by law. The designation of
any committee and the delegation of authority to it shall not operate to
relieve the Board of Directors, or any member thereof, of any responsibility
imposed upon it or any director by law.

 

Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be
determined from time to time by resolutions adopted by the Board
of Directors. A majority of all the members of any such committee may fix its
rules of procedure, determine its actions and fix the time and place, whether
within or without the State of Texas, of its meetings and specify what notice
thereof, if any, shall be given, unless the Board of Directors shall provide
otherwise by resolution or in any charters adopted therefor. The Board of
Directors shall have power to change the membership of any such committee at
any time, to fill vacancies therein and to disband any such committee, either
with or without cause, at any time, subject to applicable law. Each committee
shall keep regular minutes of its proceedings and report the same to the Board
of Directors when required. The minutes of the proceedings of each committee
shall be placed in the minute book of the Corporation.

By resolution of the Board of Directors, the members of each committee may be
paid their expenses, if any, for attendance at each committee meeting and may
be paid a fixed sum for attendance at each committee meeting. No such payment
shall preclude any committee member from serving the Corporation in any other
capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

 



-6- Section 15\. _Action by Directors without Meeting_. Any action required or
permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee
thereof may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth
the action so taken shall be signed by all the members of the Board of
Directors or committee thereof, as the case may be. The signed consent, or a
signed copy, shall be placed in the minute book. A telegram, telex, cablegram
or other electronic transmission by a director consenting to an action to be
taken and transmitted by a director is considered written, signed and dated
for the purposes hereof if the transmission sets forth or is delivered with
information from which the Corporation can determine that the transmission was
transmitted by a director and the date on which the director transmitted the
transmission. As permitted by Section 6.201 of the TBOC, members of the Board
of Directors, or members of any committee designated by such Board, may
participate and hold a meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee
by means of conference telephone, video conference, the Internet or similar
communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the
meeting can hear each other, and participation in such meeting pursuant to a
conference call or similar communications equipment shall constitute presence
in person at such meeting provided that, in connection with such meeting, the
Company has implemented reasonable measures to verify that every person voting
at the meeting by means of remote communications is sufficiently identified
and a record is kept of any votes cast.

ARTICLE IV

 

INDEMNITY; INSURANCE

 

Section 1\. _Indemnification_. Each person who at any time shall serve, or
shall have served, as a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation, or any person who, while a director, officer, employee or agent
of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee,
administrator, employee, agent or similar functionary of another foreign or
domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise (each such person referred to herein
as an "Indemnitee"), shall be entitled to indemnification as and to the
fullest extent permitted by Chapter 8 of the TBOC. The foregoing right of
indemnification shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which
those to be indemnified may be entitled as a matter of law or under any
agreement, other provision of these By-Laws, vote of shareholders or directors
or other arrangement. The Corporation may enter into indemnification
agreements with

 



-9-  its executive officers or directors that contractually provide to them the
benefits of the provisions of this Article IV and include related provisions
meant to facilitate the Indemnitees receipt of such benefits and such other
indemnification protections as may be deemed appropriate.

Section 2\. _Advancement or Reimbursement of Expenses_. The rights of
Indemnitee provided under the preceding section shall include, but not be
limited to, the right to be indemnified and to have expenses advanced in all
proceedings to the fullest extent permitted by Chapter 8 of the TBOC and
other applicable law. In the event that an Indemnitee is not wholly
successful, on the merits or otherwise, in a proceeding but is successful, on
the merits or otherwise, as to any claim in such proceeding, the
Corporation shall indemnify Indemnitee against all expenses actually and
reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitees behalf relating to each
claim. The termination of a claim in a proceeding by dismissal, with or
without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such
claim. In addition, to the extent an Indemnitee is, by reason of his or her
corporate status, a witness or otherwise participates in any proceeding at a
time when he or she is not named a defendant or respondent in the proceeding,
he or she shall be indemnified against all expenses actually and reasonably
incurred by such individual or on his or her behalf in connection therewith.
The Corporation shall pay all reasonable expenses incurred by or on behalf
of Indemnitee in connection with any proceeding or claim, whether brought by
the Corporation or otherwise, in advance of any determination respecting
entitlement to indemnification pursuant to this Article IV within ten (10)
days after the receipt by the Corporation of a written request from
Indemnitee reasonably evidencing such expenses and requesting such payment or
payments from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of
such proceeding or claim; provided that the Indemnitee affirms his or her
good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for
indemnification under this Article IV and undertakes and agrees in writing
that he or she will reimburse and repay the Corporation for any expenses so
advanced to the extent that it shall ultimately be determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction, in a final adjudication from which there is no further
right of appeal, that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against
such expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall a director or
executive officer be entitled to the advancement of expenses if a
determination has been made by a judicial authority or governmental entity or
agency or, absent such determination, any such authority, entity or agency
has taken a position or issued any guidance stating, that the advancement of
expenses to a director or executive officer constitutes a personal loan in
contravention of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or any similar
law or regulation.

Section 3\. _Determination of Request_. Upon written request to
the Corporation by an Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to these By-
Laws, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to
Indemnitees entitlement thereto shall be made in accordance with Sections
8.101 and 8.103 of the TBOC;  _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a Change in Control shall have occurred, such determination
shall be made by Independent Counsel selected by Indemnitee, unless Indemnitee
shall request that such determination be made in accordance with Section
8.103(a) (1) or (2). The Corporation shall pay any and all reasonable fees and
expenses of Independent Counsel incurred in connection with any such
determination. If a Change in Control shall have occurred, Indemnitee shall
be presumed (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article IV) to be
entitled to indemnification under this Article IV upon submission of a request
to the Corporation for indemnification, and thereafter the Corporation shall
have the burden of proof in overcoming that presumption in reaching a

 



-10-  determination contrary to that presumption. The presumption shall be used by
Independent Counsel, or such other person or persons determining entitlement
to indemnification, as a basis for a determination of entitlement to
indemnification unless the Corporation provides information sufficient to
overcome such presumption by clear and convincing evidence or the
investigation, review and analysis of Independent Counsel or such
other person or persons convinces him, her or them by clear and convincing
evidence that the presumption should not apply.

Section 4.  _Effect of Certain Proceedings_. The termination of any
proceeding or of any claim in a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or
conviction, or upon a plea of _nolo contendere_ or its equivalent, shall not
(except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article) by itself adversely
affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that
Indemnitees conduct was not in good faith and in a manner that Indemnitee
reasonably believed in the case of conduct in Indemnitees official capacity,
that was not in the best interests of the Corporation or, in all other cases,
that was not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation or, with respect
to any criminal proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe
that Indemnitees conduct was unlawful and Indemnitee shall be deemed to have
been found liable in respect of any claim only after Indemnitee shall have
been so adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction after exhaustion of all
appeals therefrom.

Section 5\. _Expenses of Enforcement of Article_. In the event that
Indemnitee, pursuant to this Article IV, seeks a judicial adjudication to
enforce Indemnitees rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, rights
created under or pursuant to this Article IV, Indemnitee shall be entitled to
recover from the Corporation, and shall be indemnified by the Corporation
against, any and all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee
in such judicial adjudication but only if Indemnitee prevails therein. If it
shall be determined in said judicial adjudication that Indemnitee is entitled
to receive part but not all of the indemnification or advancement of expenses
sought, the expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such judicial
adjudication shall be reasonably prorated in good faith by counsel
for Indemnitee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change in Control shall
have occurred, Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification under this
Section 5 regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately prevails in such
judicial adjudication.

 

Section 6\. _Insurance Arrangements_. The Corporation may procure or maintain
insurance or other similar arrangements, at its expense, to protect itself
and any Indemnitee against any expense, liability or loss asserted against or
incurred by such person, incurred by Indemnitee in such a capacity or arising
out of Indemnitees status as such a person, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense or
liability. In considering the cost and availability of such insurance, the
Corporation (through the exercise of the business judgment of its directors
and officers), from time to time, may purchase insurance which provides for
any and all of (i) deductibles, (ii) limits on payments required to be made by
the insurer or (iii) coverage which may not be as comprehensive as that
previously included in such insurance purchased by the Corporation, if any.
The purchase of insurance with deductibles, limits on payments and coverage
exclusions will be deemed to be in the best interest of the Corporation but
may not be in the best interest of certain of the persons covered thereby.
This Section 6 is authorized by Section 8.151 of the TBOC as in effect on the
date hereof, and further is intended to establish an arrangement of self-
insurance pursuant to that section.

 



-11- Section 7\. _Severability_. If any provision or provisions of this Article IV
shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason
whatsoever, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and, to the
fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article IV shall be construed
so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable.

 

Section 8\. _Definitions_. The following terms are used herein as follows:

 

"Change in Control" means a change in control of the Corporation, which will
be deemed to have occurred if at any time after the date of the adoption of
these By-Laws, any of the following events shall occur: (i) the Corporation is
merged, consolidated, converted or reorganized into or with another
corporation or other legal entity, and as a result of such
merger, consolidation, conversion or reorganization less than a majority of

and/or such voting power is not held by substantially all of such holders in
substantially the same proportions relative to each other, (ii) the
Corporation sells (directly or indirectly) all or substantially all of its
assets (including, without limitation, by means of the sale of the capital
stock or assets of one or more direct or indirect subsidiaries of

less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding
voting securities (entitled to vote generally in the election of directors or
persons performing similar functions on behalf of such other corporation or
legal entity) of such other corporation or legal entity is held in the
aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock of the Corporation immediately prior
to such sale and/or such voting power is not held by substantially all of
such holders in substantially the same proportions relative to each other,
(iii) any person (as the term "person" is used in Section 13(d)(3) or Section
14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act")) becomes (subsequent to the date of the adoption of these By-Laws) the
beneficial owner (as the term "beneficial owner" is defined under Rule 13d-3
or any successor rule or regulation promulgated under the Exchange Act) of
securities representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting
power of the then-outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors of the Corporation ("Voting Stock"), (iv) the
Corporation files a report or proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act disclosing in response to Form 8-K,
Schedule 14A or Schedule 14C (or any successor schedule, form or report or
item therein) that a change in control of the Corporation has occurred, (v) if
during any one (1) year period, individuals who at the beginning of any such
period constitute the directors of the Corporation cease for any reason to
constitute at least a majority thereof, unless the election, or the nomination
for election by the Corporations shareholders, of each director of the
Corporation first elected during such period was approved by a vote of at
least two-thirds (2/3rds) of (a) the directors of the Corporation then still
in office who were directors of the Corporation at the beginning of any such
period or (b) directors referenced in clause (a) immediately preceding plus
directors of the Corporation whose nomination and/or election was approved by
the directors referenced in clause (a) immediately preceding or (vi) the
shareholders of the Corporation approve a plan contemplating the liquidation
or dissolution of the Corporation.

 



-12- "Corporate Status" means the status of a person who is or was a director,
officer, partner, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Corporation or of any
other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise which such person is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation.

 

"Disinterested Director" means a director of the Corporation who is not a

hereunder or (c) the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities
of the Corporation representing thirty percent (30%) or more of the combined

include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct
then prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the
Corporation or Indemnitee in an action to determine Indemnitees rights to
indemnification under these By-Laws.

 

ARTICLE V

Section 1\. _Certificates_. The shares of the Corporation may be either

Corporation. Certificates shall be consecutively numbered and shall be entered
in the books of the Corporation as they are issued. Each certificate shall
state on its face the holders name, the number and class of shares, the par
value of shares or a statement that such shares are without par value, and
such other matters as may be required by law. If a certificate

registered by a registrar (either of which is other than the Corporation or an
employee of the Corporation), the signature of any officer may be facsimile.

 

Section 2\. _Issuance_. Shares (both treasury and authorized but unissued) may
be issued for such consideration (not less than par value) and to such
persons as the Board of Directors may determine from time to time. Shares may
not be issued until the full amount of the consideration, fixed as provided by
law, has been paid.

 

Section 3\. _Payment for Shares_.

shares of stock, upon receipt of proper transfer instructions from the
registered holder of the shares or by such persons attorney lawfully
constituted in writing, and upon payment of all necessary transfer taxes and
compliance with appropriate procedures for transferring shares in
uncertificated form; provided, however, that such surrender and endorsement,
compliance or payment of taxes shall not be required in any case in which the
officers of the Corporation shall determine to waive such requirement. With
respect to certificated shares of stock, every certificate exchanged, returned
or surrendered to the Corporation shall be marked "Cancelled," with the date
of cancellation, by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Corporation
or the transfer agent thereof. No transfer of stock shall be valid as against
the Corporation for any purpose until it shall have been entered into the

transferred.

Section 5\. _Subscriptions_. Unless otherwise provided in the subscription
agreement, subscriptions for shares, whether made before or after
organization of the Corporation, shall be paid in full at such time or in such
installments and at such times as shall be determined by the Board of

subscriptions shall be uniform as to all shares of the same series. In case of
default in the payment on any installment or call when payment is due, the
Corporation may proceed to collect the amount due in the same manner as any
debt due the Corporation.

Section 6\. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. The Corporation shall
issue a new certificate in place of any certificate for shares previously
issued if the registered owner of the certificate:

(a) Makes proof in affidavit form that it has been lost, destroyed, or
wrongfully taken; and

(b) Requests the issuance of a new certificate before the Corporation has
notice that the certificate has been acquired by a purchaser for value in
good faith and without notice of an adverse claim; and

(c) Gives a bond in such form, and with such surety or sureties, with fixed
or open penalty, as the Corporation may direct, to indemnify the Corporation
(and its transfer agent and registrar, if any) against any claim that may be
made on account of the alleged loss, destruction or theft of the certificate;
and

(d) Satisfies any other reasonable requirements imposed by the Corporation.

 



-14- When a certificate has been lost, apparently destroyed or wrongfully taken,
and the holder of record fails to notify the Corporation within a reasonable
time after he or she has notice of it, and the Corporation registers a
transfer of the shares represented by the certificate before receiving such
notification, the holder of record is precluded from making any claim against
the Corporation for the transfer or for a new certificate.

transfer of a new certificate for shares presented to it for transfer if:

her duly authorized attorney; and

association and reasonable assurance is given that such endorsements are
effective; and
