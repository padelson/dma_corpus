Indemnitee is entitled to receive part but not all of the indemnification or advancement of expenses sought, the expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such judicial adjudication shall be reasonably prorated in good faith by counsel for
Indemnitee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change in Control shall have occurred, Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification under this Section&nbsp;5 regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately prevails in such judicial adjudication. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;6. <U>Insurance Arrangements</U>. The Corporation may procure or maintain insurance or other similar arrangements, at its
expense, to protect itself and any Indemnitee against any expense, liability or loss asserted against or incurred by such person, incurred by Indemnitee in such a capacity or arising out of Indemnitee&#146;s status as such a person, whether or not
the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense or liability. In considering the cost and availability of such insurance, the Corporation (through the exercise of the business judgment of its directors and
officers), from time to time, may purchase insurance which provides for any and all of (i)&nbsp;deductibles, (ii)&nbsp;limits on payments required to be made by the insurer or (iii)&nbsp;coverage which may not be as comprehensive as that previously
included in such insurance purchased by the Corporation, if any. The purchase of insurance with deductibles, limits on payments and coverage exclusions will be deemed to be in the best interest of the Corporation but may not be in the best interest
of certain of the persons covered thereby. This Section&nbsp;6 is authorized by Section&nbsp;8.151 of the TBOC as in effect on the date hereof, and further is intended to establish an arrangement of self-insurance pursuant to that section. </P>
