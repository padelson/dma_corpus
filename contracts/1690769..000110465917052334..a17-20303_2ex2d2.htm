Contributors objection notice, then any Party may refer such dispute to the
Independent Accounting Firm, and the Parties shall direct the Independent
Accounting Firm to make a final and binding determination as to all matters in
dispute (and only such matters) on a timely basis (and in any event within

Independent Accounting Firm to assign a value to any particular item greater

Contributor accepts the Closing Date Statement, the Net Working Capital, the

as set forth on the Closing Date Statement shall become final and binding upon
the Parties for all purposes hereunder. If Contributor does object to the

shall become final and binding for all purposes hereunder except with respect
to, and only to the extent of, those matters expressly objected to by
Contributor in such objection; _provided_ , that where any matter to which
Contributor expressly objects would, if decided in Contributors favor,
warrant an adjustment to any other amount set forth on the Closing Date
Statement, then notwithstanding the foregoing, such other amount shall become
final and binding only after the matter to which Contributor expressly objects
has been resolved and all applicable adjustments necessarily stemming
therefrom have been made. The Net Working Capital as finally determined in
accordance with this _Section 2.6(c)_ shall be referred to as the " ** _Final
NWC_** ," the Closing Debt as finally determined in accordance with this
_Section 2.6(c)_ shall be referred to as the " ** _Final Closing Debt_** ,"

_Section 2.6(c)_ shall be referred to as the " ** _Final Transaction

_Section 2.6(c)_ shall be referred to as the " ** _Final CapEx Amount_** ,"
and the Banking Fees as finally determined in accordance with this _Section
2.6(c)_ shall be referred to as the " ** _Final Banking Fees_**."

 



 

(d) The " ** _Adjustment Amount_** ", which may be positive or negative, shall
mean the amount equal to (A) the Final NWC _minus_ the NWC Estimate, _minus_
(B) Final Closing Debt _minus_ the Debt Estimate, _minus_ (C) the Final
Transaction Expenses _minus_ the Transaction Expenses Estimate, _plus_ (D) the
Final CapEx Amount _minus_ the CapEx Estimate (subject to clause (e) below),
_minus_ (E) the Final Banking Fees _minus_ the Banking Fee Estimate.

 



 

(i) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then, within five Business
Days after such amount is so agreed or determined, Buyer shall pay to the
Partnership an amount equal to the Adjustment Amount and cause the
Partnership, in turn, to pay to Contributor an amount equal to the Adjustment
Amount.

 



 

(ii) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number (the absolute value of such
number, the " ** _Contributor Adjustment Amount_** "), then, within five
Business Days after

 



      
 

 



 

such amount is agreed or determined, Contributor and Buyer shall submit joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
release Escrow Funds to the Partnership equal to the lesser of the Contributor
Adjustment Amount and the Escrow Amount. If the Contributor Adjustment Amount
exceeds the Escrow Amount (the amount of such excess, the " ** _Excess
Adjustment Amount_** "), then Contributor shall also transfer Reserved Units
to the Partnership with a value equal to the Excess Adjustment Amount (valued
in accordance with this _Section 10.7(b)_). If the Escrow Amount exceeds the
Contributor Adjustment Amount (the " ** _Excess Escrow Amount_** "),
Contributor and Buyer shall submit joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release Escrow Funds to Contributor
equal to the Excess Escrow Amount.

 



 

(iii) Each of the foregoing payments shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by such recipient.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for purposes of
determining the Estimated Adjustment Amount and the Adjustment Amount, unless
otherwise approved in writing by Buyer, neither the CapEx Estimate nor the
Final Capex Amount, respectively, shall exceed the following:

 



 

(i) if the Closing occurs on or prior to September 30, 2017, $50,000,000 (in
the aggregate); and

(y) an amount equal to the product of (A) $600,000 and (B) the number of
calendar days during the period beginning on October 1, 2017 and ending on the
Closing Date.

 



 

2.7 **_Earn-Out Consideration_**.

 



 

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the seven-
year anniversary of the Closing Date,

the 20-Day VWAP equals or exceeds $14.00, Buyer shall cause the Partnership to
issue 7,142,857 Common Units to Contributor; and

 



 

(ii) promptly and in any event within 5 Business Days after the first date
that the 20-Day VWAP equals or exceeds $16.00, Buyer shall cause the
Partnership to issue 6,250,000 Common Units to Contributor (each issuance of
Common Units pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) above, an **_"Earn-Out
Payment"_** and all Earn-Out Payments, collectively, the **_"Earn-Out
Consideration"_** ).

 



 

(b) In the event that the Partnership shall issue any Common Units in
satisfaction of an Earn-Out Payment, Buyer shall issue to Contributor, a
number of shares of Buyer Class C Common Stock equal to the number of Common
Units so issued, and Contributor shall separately pay Buyer an amount of cash
equal to the number of shares of Buyer Class C Common Stock received
multiplied by the par value of such shares. The right to receive the Earn-Out
Consideration shall be transferrable on a share-by-share basis by Contributor
to the same extent that the Common Units and shares of Buyer Class C Common
Stock received by

 



      
 

 



 

Contributor pursuant to this Agreement are transferrable by Contributor;
_provided_ that Contributor and such transferees shall deliver notice to Buyer
indicating the Common Units and shares of Buyer Class C Common Stock such
transferee may be entitled to receive and an undertaking to indemnify Buyer
and its Affiliates in the event of any dispute by Contributor or any such
transferee or other Affiliate of Contributor or transferee with respect to any
such transfer or the Common Units and/or shares of Buyer Class C Common Stock
to be delivered in accordance therewith.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) Contributor shall not
be entitled to receive a particular Earn-Out Payment on more than one
occasion, and (ii) in the event that, on a particular date, the 20-Day VWAP
entitles Contributor to more than one Earn-Out Payment (each of which has not
previously been paid), Contributor shall be entitled to receive each such
Earn-Out Payment.

 



 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, **_"Liquidity Event Consideration"_**
means the amount per share to be received by a holder of shares of Buyer Class
A Common Stock in connection with a Liquidity Event, with any non-cash
consideration valued as determined by the value ascribed to such consideration
by the parties to such transaction. In the event that the Liquidity Event
Consideration is greater than the 20-Day VWAP hurdle with respect to any Earn-
Out Payment not previously paid, then the corresponding Earn-Out Payment shall
be made, and the applicable Common Units shall be deemed issued and
outstanding, effective immediately prior to the consummation of such Liquidity
Event and the holders thereof shall be entitled to receive the corresponding
Liquidity Event Consideration. Thereafter, Buyer shall cease to have any
further obligation under _Section 2.7(a)_ or this _Section 2.7(d)_. Any such
Earn-Out Payment shall not be paid or payable in the event such Liquidity
Event is not consummated and the Buyer will continue to have the obligations
set forth in this _Section 2.7_.

 



 

(e) If, prior to the termination of Buyers obligation to make any Earn-Out
Payment, any change in the outstanding shares of Buyer Class A Common Stock
shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend, the Earn-Out Payments and 20-Day VWAP targets
set forth above shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change and to
provide to Contributor the same economic effect as contemplated by this
_Section 2.7(a) _prior to such change.

 



 

2.8 **_Withholding_**. Buyer and the Partnership shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to Contributor such amounts as Buyer or the Partnership, as
applicable, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any Tax law,
with respect to the making of such payment; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Buyer and Partnership shall notify Contributor of any amounts expected to be
deducted and withheld at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date and the basis for such deduction and withholding. Buyer or the
Partnership, as applicable, shall reasonably cooperate with Contributor to
reduce or eliminate any deductions and withholdings. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made.

any Contract to which Buyer is a party or by which Buyer is bound, or (iii)

be expected to reduce, limit, terminate or otherwise modify (in any manner

respective Affiliates to the extent relating to the period prior to Closing)
any obligation of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to indemnify pursuant to
the Organizational Documents of the Company the Contributor Appointees,
Contributor or its Affiliates to the extent relating to periods prior to
Closing. Buyer shall cause the Company to, effective as of the Closing Date,
obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies that cover the
Companys existing directors and officers for a claims-reporting or discovery
period of at least six years from and after the Closing Date from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance carrier and with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less advantageous than the
coverage provided under the Companys existing policies with respect to any
actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission,
neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against any of the Contributor
Appointees by reason of his or her service as an officer or director of the
Company at or prior to the Closing Date (including in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not be required to spend more than 300% (the " ** _D andO Cap Amount_**")
of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the Execution Date per
year for such coverage under such tail policy; _provided, further,_ that if
the cost of such insurance exceeds the DandO Cap Amount, and the Company elects
not to spend more than the DandO Cap Amount for such purpose, then the Company
shall purchase as much coverage as is obtainable for the DandO Cap Amount which
shall satisfy the obligations of Buyer and the Company under this _Section
6.6_. From and after the Closing, in the event that Buyer or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.6_. Buyer shall not sell,
transfer, distribute or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to render the Buyer unable to satisfy their
obligations under this _Section 6.6_.

 



 

6.7 **_Tax Matters_**.

 



 

(a) Contributor shall prepare or cause to be prepared (i) all Tax Returns
required to be filed by the Company or any Subsidiary for all Tax periods
ending prior to the Closing Date that are due on or after the Closing Date,

"flow-through" basis and required to be filed after the Closing Date for Tax
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with past practice except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Laws. Not later than thirty (30) days prior
to the due date for filing any such Tax Return, Contributor shall deliver a
copy of such Tax Return, together with all supporting documentation, to Buyer
for its reasonable comment. Contributor shall cause such Tax Returns (as
revised to incorporate Buyers reasonable comments) to be timely filed and
will provide a copy to Buyer. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
file or cause to be filed all other Tax Returns of the Company or any
Subsidiary not specifically addressed in the first sentence of this _Section
6.7_, including all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company or any
Subsidiary for any Tax period that begins before the Closing Date and ends on
or after the Closing Date (the " ** _Straddle Period_** "). Such Tax Returns
for a Straddle Period shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past
practice except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Laws. Not later
than thirty

 



      
 

 



 

(30) days prior to the due date for filing any such Tax Return for a Straddle
Period, Buyer shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return, together with all
supporting documentation, to Contributor for its reasonable comment. Buyer
shall cause such Tax Returns for a Straddle Period (as revised to incorporate
Contributors reasonable comments) to be timely filed and will provide a copy
to Contributor.

 



 

(b) To the extent (i) received prior to the expiration of the Tax
Participation Period, and (ii) not (A) included in the final determination of
Net Working Capital, or (B) arising as the result of a carryback of a loss or
other Tax benefit from a Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date, the amount of any credits for or refunds of such Tax of the
Company or any Subsidiary or with respect to the Assets of the Company or any
Subsidiary relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of
Contributor. The amount of any credits for or refunds of Taxes of the Company
or any Subsidiary or with respect to the Assets of the Company or any
Subsidiary relating to any Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning on or
after the Closing Date, and the amount of any credits for or refunds of Tax
described in the preceding sentence and not for the account of Contributor,
shall be for the account of Buyer. Buyer shall forward, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to forward, to Contributor the amount of such credit for or
refund of Taxes Contributor is entitled to pursuant to this _Section 6.7(b)_,
within thirty (30) days after such refund is received or such credit is
utilized on the applicable Tax Return, in each case, net of any costs or
expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Buyer or its Subsidiaries in
procuring such refund or utilizing such credit. Contributor shall forward, and
shall cause its Affiliates to forward, to Buyer the amount of such credit for
or refund of Taxes Buyer is entitled to, pursuant to this _Section 6.7(b)_,
within thirty (30) days after such refund is received or such credit is
utilized on the applicable Tax Return, in each case, net of any costs or
expenses (including Taxes) incurred by Contributor or its Affiliates in
procuring such refund or utilizing such credit. To the extent such refund or
credit is subsequently disallowed or required to be returned to the applicable
Taxing Authority, each Party agrees promptly to repay the amount of such
refund or credit received pursuant to this _Section 6.7(b)_, together with
any interest, penalties or other additional amounts imposed by such Taxing
Authority, to the Party making payment under this _Section 6.7(b)_.

 



 

(c) No amended Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
filed by or on behalf of the Company or with respect to the Assets of the
Company without the consent of Contributor, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , that after the Tax
Participation Period, this _Section 6.7(c)_ shall not apply with respect to
any Taxes imposed on the Company and its Subsidiaries (as opposed to any "flow
through" Taxes that are imposed on Contributor or its direct or indirect
owners).

 



 

(d) Buyer and Contributor shall cooperate fully, and shall cause the Company
to cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer or
Contributor, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit or
Proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and, upon the request of Buyer or Contributor, the provision of Records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit or Proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Buyer and Contributor further agree, upon request, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Taxing
Authority or any other Person as may be

 



      
 

 



 

necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on
Contributor, Buyer, or the Company.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:

 



 

(i) Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Contributor,
and its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall promptly notify each other upon
receipt by such party of written notice of any inquiries, claims, assessments,
audits, Tax Proceeding or similar events with respect to Taxes relating to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for which
either party or any of its Affiliates may have liability under this Agreement
or otherwise (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar event, a "
** _Tax Matter_** "). Any failure to so notify the other party of a Tax Matter
shall not relieve such other party from liability with respect to such Tax
Matters except to the extent such party was actually and materially prejudiced
as a result thereof.

 



 

(ii) Contributor shall have the sole right to control any Tax Matter of the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries relating to any Tax period ending on or
before the Closing Date, and to take any actions in connection with such Tax

such Tax Matter and (II) Contributor shall obtain the written consent of Buyer
prior to the settlement of such Tax Matter that could reasonably be expected
to have an adverse effect on Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided further_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary, after the
Tax Participation Period Contributor shall not have the right pursuant to this
section 6.7(e)(ii) or (iii) to control or consent to the settlement of any
such Tax Matter that relates to Taxes imposed on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (as opposed to any "flow through" Taxes that are imposed on
Contributor or its direct or indirect owners).

 



 

(iii) Except as provided in _Section 6.7(e)(ii)_, Buyer shall have the right
to control all other Tax Matters relating to any Taxes of the Company or any
Subsidiary. Buyer shall obtain the written consent of Contributor prior to the
settlement of any issues in any such Tax Matter that could reasonably be
expected to have an adverse effect on Contributor or its members (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(f) In the event that any Transfer Taxes are imposed on the Transactions, the
Partnership shall be responsible for the payment of all such Transfer Taxes.
Contributor and Buyer shall timely file their own Tax Returns relating to
Transfer Taxes as required by Law and shall notify the other Party when such
filings have been made. Contributor and Buyer shall cooperate and consult with
each other prior to filing such Tax Returns (i) in order to minimize such
Transfer Taxes, and (ii) to ensure that all such returns are filed in a
consistent manner.

 



 

(g) Other than any customary Tax sharing or indemnification provisions
contained in any agreement entered into in the ordinary course of business and
not primarily relating to Tax, all Tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and Contributor and its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall be terminated
prior to the Closing Date, and, after the Closing Date, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be bound thereby or have any liability
thereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) _Intended Tax Treatment_.

 



 

(i) The Parties agree that the Company shall be a "disregarded entity," as

extent made in exchange for Common Units, the Contributors Contribution shall
be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as a contribution pursuant
to Section 721 of the Code; (B) to the maximum extent permitted pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-4(d), any transfer of money or other
consideration to Contributor shall not be treated as part of a sale of
property by Contributor under Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-3(a) and shall
be treated as a reimbursement of preformation capital expenditures; (C) the
sum of (1) cash and other consideration not treated as reimbursement of
preformation capital expenditures and (2) any other amounts treated as
consideration pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-3 (including the
amount of assumed liabilities treated as a transfer of consideration under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-5) will be treated as proceeds of a sale of
property by Contributor to the Partnership described in Section 707 of the
Code; and (D) to the extent permitted, issuances of Earn-Out Consideration
shall be treated as events triggering an adjustment to the book value (under
Section 704(b) of the Code) of the assets of the Partnership and the
corresponding capital account adjustments shall be made in a manner determined
to minimize differences between the partners capital accounts as determined
on a per Common Unit basis. For the avoidance of doubt, except as required by
applicable Law, the Parties shall not treat (i) the purchase of Buyer Class C
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2, or (ii) the right of Contributor to have
its Common Units redeemed by the Partnership as consideration pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-3.

 



 

(iii) The Parties shall (A) prepare and file all Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with this _Section 6.7(h)_, and (B) take no position inconsistent

good faith to prepare and agree to a statement reflecting a valuation of all
of the assets of the Company in accordance with the principles of Sections

agreed) and (ii) act in accordance with the Tax Allocation Statement (if
agreed) in the preparation, filing and audit of any Tax Return.

Code and under corresponding provisions of applicable statute and local tax
laws.

 



 

(k) The Parties agree that the Partnership shall use the "traditional
allocation method" as described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3(b).

 



 

(l) To the extent that the provisions of this _Section 6.7_ are inconsistent
with or conflict with any other provisions under this Agreement, the
provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall control.

 



      
 

 



 

6.8 **_Public Announcements; Confidentiality_**.

 



 

(a) No Party shall make any public announcement or issue any public
communication regarding this Agreement or the Transactions without first
obtaining the prior written consent of the other Party, except if such
announcement or other communication is required by applicable Law (including
in connection with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement and any
offering or other documents prepared in connection with any financing by Buyer
or the Company) or the rules of any stock exchange upon which such Partys
capital stock is traded, in which case, to the extent permitted by Law, the
disclosing Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to coordinate
or communicate such announcement or communication with the other Party prior
to announcement or issuance; _provided_ , _however_ that no provision of this
Agreement shall be deemed to restrict in any manner (i) any Partys ability to
communicate with its employees or equity holders or (ii) the ability of Buyer
and the Company to communicate with their financial and legal advisors,
lenders, underwriters or financing sources.

 



 

(b) From the Closing Date and for a period of two (2) years following the

commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to, (i) maintain
the strict confidentiality of any and all Confidential Information and (ii)
not disclose such Confidential Information to any Person other than any of its
Affiliates or Representatives, except (x) to the extent required by Law
(provided that if required by Law, Contributor agrees, to the extent legally
permissible, to give Buyer prior written notice of such disclosure in
sufficient time to permit Buyer to seek a protective order should it so
determine) or (y) in a Claim brought by Contributor in the pursuit of its
remedies under this Agreement. Contributor shall (1) notify all Persons to
whom Confidential Information is disclosed of the confidential nature of the
materials disclosed and the provisions of this Agreement; and (2) ensure that
all Persons to whom the terms of this Agreement or the Confidential
Information is disclosed keep such information confidential and do not
disclose or divulge such information to any unauthorized Person in each case
in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

6.9 **_Use of Certain Names_**. Within 180 days following Closing, Buyer shall

trade names or other Intellectual Property belonging to Contributor or any
Affiliate thereof. Buyer acknowledges that it, its Subsidiaries and, from and
after Closing, the Company have no rights whatsoever to use Contributors
Marks.

 



 

6.10 **_Distributions_**. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Contributor shall have the right to cause the Company to pay cash

as applicable, effective as of Closing, any outstanding credit support

bonds, guaranties, letters of credit, and/or cash collateral, as needed, to
effect the replacement or posting of such Support Obligations at Closing;
_provided_ that if Buyer is unable to replace or post a Support Obligation at
Closing, such existing Support Obligation shall remain in place and Buyer will
indemnify Contributor or its Affiliates, as applicable, for any Losses
resulting from payment such Person is required to make under such Support

meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority with respect to such

credit or cash collateral arrangement similar to any Support Obligation
without the prior written consent of Buyer.

containing the information specified in Schedule 14A of the Exchange Act with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Alta Mesa
Contribution Agreement and the Riverstone Contribution Agreement (the " **

Business Day period shall not elapse if Buyer provides a reasonably detailed
written notice to the Company or Alta Mesa regarding information that is

for the Proxy Statement, in which case the 20 Business Day period shall re-
commence after Buyer receives such information from the Company or Alta Mesa,
as applicable. Buyer shall as promptly as practicable notify Contributor and

including the required financial statements of the Company prepared in

SEC. Contributor and the Company shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause and make their managers, directors, officers and employees
and the managers, directors, officers and employees of the Operator available
to Buyer and its counsel in connection with the drafting of the Proxy
Statement and any other filings required to be made by Buyer with the SEC and
responding in a timely manner to comments on the Proxy Statement or such other
filings from the SEC; _provided_ that doing so does not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) Buyer will take, in accordance with applicable Law, NASDAQ rules and the
Organizational Documents of Buyer, all action necessary to call, hold and
convene a special meeting of holders of Buyer Common Stock (including any
permitted adjournment or postponement, the " ** _Special Meeting_** ") to
consider and vote upon the Stockholder Proposals as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the filing of the Proxy Statement in definitive form with
the SEC. Once the Special Meeting to consider and vote upon the Stockholder
Proposals has been called and noticed, Buyer will not postpone or adjourn the
Special Meeting without the consent of Contributor, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, other than, (1) for the absence
of a quorum, (2) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and
mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that Buyer has determined in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisors, is necessary
under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated to and reviewed by the holders of Buyer Common Stock prior to the
Special Meeting or (3) an adjournment or postponement of up to 10 Business
Days to solicit additional proxies from holders of Buyer Common Stock. Subject

approval of the Stockholder Proposals by the holders of Buyer Common Stock.

 



 

(d) The Buyer Board will recommend in the Proxy Statement that the holders of
Buyer Common Stock approve the Stockholder Proposals (the " ** _Buyer Board
Recommendation_** "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
obtaining the required stockholder approval at the Special Meeting, the Buyer
Board may withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner the Buyer Board
Recommendation (any such action a " ** _Change in Recommendation_** ") if the
Buyer Board shall have concluded in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal advisors and financial advisors, that a failure to make a Change
in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided, however,_ that the Buyer Board shall not be
entitled to exercise its rights to make a Change in

 



      
 

 



 

Recommendation pursuant to this sentence unless Buyer has provided to
Contributor three Business Days prior written notice advising Contributor
that the Buyer Board intends to take such action and specifying the reasons
therefor in reasonable detail. For the avoidance of doubt, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, any Change in
Recommendation will not (x) change the approval of this Agreement or any other
approval of the Buyer Board or (y) relieve Buyer of any of its obligations
under this Agreement, including its obligation to hold the Special Meeting.

 



 

(e) If at any time prior to the Closing Date, any event, circumstance or
information relating to Buyer, Contributor or the Company and its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, officers or directors
should be discovered by Buyer, Contributor or the Company, as applicable, that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or
any other filings to be made by Buyer with the SEC, so that such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC by Buyer and, to the extent required by Law,
disseminated to the holders of Buyer Common Stock; _provided_ that no
information received by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 6.12(e)_ shall
operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty or
agreement given or made hereunder by any Party, and no such information shall
be deemed to change, supplement or amend the Schedules.

 



 

(f) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 11.13_, to the extent
Buyer has any assets other than its interest in the Trust Account, Buyer shall
promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this
_Section 6.12_ and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries, Contributor and their respective Representatives and Affiliates
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or out-of-pocket
expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the Proxy
Statement and any information used in connection therewith, except for
Liabilities of the Company to the extent they resulted from information
provided by Contributor or the Company specifically for use in connection with
the Proxy Statement containing any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

11.13_, to the extent Buyer has any assets other than its interest in the

commencement of employment to be effective upon the applicable Transfer Date
(as defined below), (B) an annualized base salary or base

 



      
 

 



 

hourly pay rate, as applicable, that is not less than that received by the

months following the Closing, or such later time as may be required by
applicable Law. The entity with which post-Closing employment is offered to an
Available Employee pursuant to this _Section 6.15(a)_ is referred to as the "
** _Buyer Employer_**." At least five (5) days prior to the anticipated
Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Operator a list of the Available
Employees who have accepted employment with Buyer Employer (each such
individual who accepts such employment offers and commences employment with
Buyer Employer following the Closing is referred to as a " ** _Transferred

employment. While a Transferred Employee remains employed, Buyer Employer
shall not reduce any Transferred Employees initial base salary or base hourly
pay rate, as applicable, for a period of at least twelve (12) months beginning

_Section 6.15(a)_.

 



 

(b) The " ** _Transfer Date_** " for each Transferred Employee shall be the

Transfer Date shall be the date following the Closing upon which such Leave
Employee commences employment with Buyer Employer.

 



 

(c) Buyer covenants that Buyer Employer shall provide to all Transferred
Employees, for at least twelve (12) months following the Closing Date,
employee benefits (including severance) that are, in the aggregate,
substantially comparable to those offered by Buyer Employer to its similarly
situated employees. Buyer covenants that effective as of each Transferred
Employees Transfer Date, Buyer shall or cause its Subsidiaries to recognize
years of service with Operator (together with any predecessors thereof that
previously employed such Transferred Employee and as to which Operator has
recognized such years of service) for purposes of determining such Transferred
Employees eligibility to participate in and vesting under any and all
applicable plans or policies of Buyer and its Subsidiaries (other than any
defined benefit plans and equity and incentive arrangements and severance
benefit pursuant to the foregoing sentence); _provided_ , _however_ , that
such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits.

 



 

(d) To the extent Buyer or its Subsidiaries provides employee welfare benefit
plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) to similarly situated employees to
the Transferred Employees, Buyer covenants that effective as of each
Transferred Employees Transfer Date, Buyer shall, or cause its Subsidiaries
to, to the extent permitted under applicable Law and the terms of the
applicable employee welfare benefit plans, use commercially reasonable efforts
to (A) ensure that for each Transferred Employee and any dependent thereof
covered by Operators or Operators Affiliates employee welfare benefit
plans, Buyers or its Subsidiaries welfare benefit plans shall waive all
coverage exclusions and limitations relating to waiting periods or

 



      
 

 



 

pre-existing conditions to the extent any such exclusions or limitations were
waived or were inapplicable under the analogous welfare benefit plan of
Operator or its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (B)
credit the expenses of each Transferred Employee which were credited toward
deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums for the year in which the
Transferred Employees Transfer Date occurs under the applicable welfare
benefit plan of Operator or Operators Affiliates against satisfaction of any
deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums for the year in which the
Transferred Employees Transfer Date occurs under Buyers or its Subsidiaries
welfare benefit plan for each Transferred Employee; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Buyers obligations under this clause (B) shall be subject to Buyers or
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, insurers, receipt of all necessary
information, from either Operator or such Transferred Employee related to such
amounts.

 



 

(e) Contributor shall cause each Transferred Employee to become fully vested
no later than the Transfer Date in all unpaid amounts payable under the
retention bonus agreements with Operator set forth on _Schedule 6.15(e)_ and
shall cause the amounts payable under such retention bonus agreements and all
wages, salaries, commissions and similar compensation earned or accrued
through the Transfer Date, including all accrued and unused paid time off, to
be paid to the Transferred Employees promptly, and in any event no later than
Operators next regularly scheduled payroll payment date. Contributor shall
further cause (i) each Transferred Employee to become fully vested as of no
later than the Transfer Date in the Transferred Employees account under any
Benefit Plan of Contributor, Operator or their ERISA Affiliate that is a
401(k) plan (the " ** _Contributor 401(k) Plan_**"), including with respect
to any employer contributions to any such plan for the period occurring prior
to and ending on the Transfer Date (which such contributions Contributor shall
cause to be made as soon as reasonably practicable following the Transfer
Date), (ii) the Contributor 401(k) Plan to permit, if elected by a Transferred
Employee, the rollover of such Transferred Employees account balance
(including outstanding loans) to a 401(k) plan sponsored by Buyer or its
Subsidiary, to the extent permitted by Law, and (iii) to the extent any
Transferred Employee has a loan outstanding as of the Transfer Date under the
Contributor 401(k) Plan, cause such loan to remain outstanding (and not go
into default) until the first to occur of the end of the first full calendar
quarter following the Transfer Date or the earlier rollover of the Transferred
Employees Contributor 401(k) Plan account balance and loan note to a 401(k)
plan sponsored by Buyer or its Subsidiary.

 



 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 6.15_ are solely for the benefit of the
Parties and nothing in this _Section 6.15_, express or implied, shall confer
upon any Available Employee or legal representative or beneficiary thereof,
any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued
employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature
or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 6.15_,
express or implied, shall be (i) deemed an amendment of any employee benefit
plan providing benefits to any Available Employee, or (ii) construed to
prevent Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including Buyer Employer) from
terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any employee benefit
plan that Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries may establish or maintain.

thereof and (B) the Outside Date;

 



 

(d) at any time before Closing, by Buyer or Contributor, by written notice to
the Parties, if Closing has not occurred on or before February 28, 2018 (the "
** _Outside Date_** ");

 



       
 

 



 

(e) at any time before the Closing, by Buyer or Contributor, by written notice
to the Parties, if the Alta Mesa Contribution Agreement shall have been
terminated in accordance with its terms; or

 



 

(f) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Contributor;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Contributor nor Buyer shall be entitled
to terminate this Agreement under _Sections 9.1(b)_ , _9.1(c)_ or _9.1(d)_
as applicable, if Contributor or Buyer, respectively, is then in breach of any
of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement,
and such breach would or does, assuming Closing were to occur on the proposed
date of termination, result in the failure to fulfill any condition expressly
set forth in _Article VII_ or _Article VIII_, as applicable, or to otherwise
consummate the Closing on or prior to the Outside Date.

 



 

9.2 **_Effect of Termination_**.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_,
subject to the last sentence of this _Section 9.2_, this Agreement shall
become void and of no further force or effect, _provided_ that,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, _Article I_, _Sections
6.2(b)_ , _6.8_ , _6.12(f)_ , the last sentence of _6.13_ , this _Article IX_
and _Article XI_, along with any obligation or covenant that otherwise
expressly survives, will survive any such termination. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall not be affected by a termination of this Agreement. Nothing in
this _Section 9.2_, however, shall be deemed to extinguish any right or
remedy of any Party that shall have accrued hereunder prior to any such
termination, or release any Party from any liability for any Willful and
Material Breach by such Party of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
prior to such termination.

 



 

9.3 **_Specific Performance_**. Each of Contributor and Buyer acknowledges
that the other would be damaged irreparably if the obligations of Contributor
or Buyer, as applicable, under this Agreement to be performed at or in
connection with, or following, the Closing are not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Parties
agree that, in lieu of termination of this Agreement as contemplated in
_Section 9.1_, following the Closing, Contributor and Buyer may seek to
enforce specifically the express obligations of the other under this Agreement
or in connection with the Closing.

in which event Contributor shall be liable for Losses only to the extent they

(d) In no event shall the liability of the Contributor under Section 10.1(a)
exceed the value of the Reserved Units determined in accordance with _Section
10.7(b)_ (the " ** _Cap Amount_** ").

 



 

(e) Buyer shall have no liability under _Section 10.1(b)(i)_ in connection

give written notice to Contributor within a reasonable period of time after
becoming aware of such breach; _provided_ that the failure to provide such

the defense of a matter is materially prejudiced by the failure to provide
such notice.

 



 

(i) If Contributor becomes aware of any breach by Buyer of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, Contributor must give
written notice to Buyer within a reasonable period of time after becoming
aware of such breach; _provided_ that the failure to provide such notice shall
not relieve any Party of liability hereunder except to the extent the defense
of a matter is materially prejudiced by the failure to provide such notice.

 



 

(j) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 10.2_ to the contrary, (i) in
no event will the limitations set forth in _Sections 10.2(a)_ through _(d)_
apply in the event of Fraud by Contributor, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates, and (ii) in no event will the limitations set forth in
_Section 10.2(a)_ or _Sections 10.2(e)_ through _(g)_ apply in the event of
Fraud by Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

(k) The Party seeking indemnification hereunder shall have a duty to use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss in connection with this
Agreement.

 



 

(l) If any Reserved Units are transferred to any Buyer Indemnified Party in
respect of an Indemnity Claim brought by Buyer pursuant to _Section 10.1_ and
such Buyer Indemnified Party subsequently recovers, directly or indirectly,
from any other Person any amount in respect of the Losses underlying such
Indemnity Claim, then Buyer shall, or shall cause such Buyer

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Party to, promptly return to Contributor Reserved Units that have
a value equal to the amount so recovered, with such value being determined in
accordance with _Section 10.7(b)_.

of and to the extent of any item or any Losses that have been reflected as a
Current Liability in Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 2.6_.

 



 

(n) Contributor and Buyer acknowledge that, except with respect to the
enforcement of covenants to be performed after the Closing, after Closing the
surrender, release or transfer of Reserved Units pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement shall be adequate compensation for breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or for any other

surrender, release or transfer of Reserved Units shall be adequate
compensation, Buyer and Contributor hereby waive any right to rescind this
Agreement or any of the Transactions.

 



 

(o) References to Material Adverse Effect and other materiality qualifications
shall be disregarded solely for purposes of calculating Losses with respect to

herein or hereunder has occurred.

(a) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, IT IS THE

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, other than in

Representative of any such Affiliate or any Person directly or indirectly

directly or indirectly owning any interest in Buyer) shall have any Liability

in any Closing Certificate delivered by Buyer.

 



 

10.5 **_Procedure with Respect to Third-Party Claims._**

 



 

(a) If any Buyer Indemnified Party or Contributor Indemnified Party (each, an
" ** _Indemnitee_** ") becomes subject to a pending or threatened Claim of a
third party (a " ** _Third Party Claim_** ") and Buyer or Contributor, as
applicable (the " ** _Claiming Party_** "), believes such Indemnitee has an
Indemnity Claim against the other Party (the " ** _Responding Party_** ") as a
result, then the Claiming Party shall promptly notify the Responding Party in
writing of the basis for such Indemnity Claim setting forth the nature of the
Third Party Claim and the amount thereof in reasonable detail. The failure of
the Claiming Party to so notify the Responding Party shall not relieve the
Responding Party of liability hereunder except to the extent that the defense
of such Third Party Claim is materially prejudiced by the failure to give such
notice.

 



 

(b) If any Third Party Claim is brought by a third party against an Indemnitee
and the Claiming Party gives notice to the Responding Party pursuant to
_Section 10.5(a)_, the Responding Party shall be entitled to participate in
such Third Party Claim and, if the Responding Party wishes, the Responding
Party may elect to control the defense of such Third Party Claim (such
election to be without prejudice to the right of the Responding Party to
dispute whether such Third Party Claim is for indemnifiable Losses under this
_Article X_), if (i) the Responding Party provides written notice to the
Claiming Party that the Responding Party intends to undertake such defense and
(ii) the Responding Party conducts the defense of such Third Party Claim
actively and diligently with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Claiming
Party. The Claiming Party shall, in its sole discretion, have the right to
employ separate counsel (who may be selected by the Claiming Party in its sole
discretion) in any such action and to participate in (but not control) the
defense or settlement thereof, and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall
be paid by such Claiming Party. The Claiming Party shall cooperate reasonably
with the

 



      
 

 



 

Responding Party and its counsel in the defense or compromise of such Third
Party Claim. If the Responding Party assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, no compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim may be effected
by the Responding Party without the Claiming Partys consent unless (A) there
is no finding or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the
rights of any Person and no effect on any other Claims that may be made
against the Claiming Party, (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages
that (1) in the event that Buyer is the Responding Party, are fully covered by
the Responding Party, or (2) in the event that Contributor is the Responding
Party, the amount of such monetary damages is no greater than the value of the
Reserved Units with such value being determined in accordance with _Section
10.7(b)_, and Contributor transfers a number of Reserved Units to the
Partnership with a value equal to the amount of such monetary damages at the
time the compromise or settlement is effected with such value being determined
in accordance with _Section 10.7(b)_.

 



 

(c) If notice is given to the Responding Party of the commencement of any
Third Party Claim and the Responding Party does not, within 30 days after the
Claiming Partys notice is given pursuant to _Section 10.5(a)_, give notice
to the Claiming Party of its election to control the defense of such Third
Party Claim, or if any of the conditions set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of
_Section 10.5(b)_ become unsatisfied, then the Claiming Party shall (upon
notice to the Responding Party) have the right to control the defense,
compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Responding Party shall, subject to the limitations of liability set
forth herein, reimburse the Claiming Party for the costs of defending against
such Third Party Claim (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) and
shall, subject to the limitations of liability set forth herein, remain
otherwise responsible for any liability with respect to amounts arising from
or related to such Third Party Claim, in both cases to the extent it is
ultimately determined that such Responding Party is liable with respect to
such Third Party Claim for a breach under this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Claiming Party may not effect any such compromise or
settlement without the consent of the Responding Party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, denied or delayed). The Responding Party may
elect to participate in such Third Party Claim at any time at its own expense.

 



 

10.6 **_Procedure with Respect to Direct Claims_**. Promptly after any
Claiming Party comes to believe that its related Indemnitee has an Indemnity
Claim against a Responding Party which does not involve a Third Party Claim (a
" ** _Direct Claim_** "), the Claiming Party shall notify the Responding Party
in writing of such Direct Claim and specify in such notice the basis for such
Direct Claim setting forth the nature of the Claim and, to the extent known,
the amount thereof in reasonable detail. Any failure of a Claiming Party to so
notify a Responding Party shall not relieve the Responding Party of liability
hereunder except to the extent that the defense of such Direct Claim is
materially prejudiced by the failure to give such notice.

 



 

10.7 **_Payments of Indemnity Amounts_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the limitations in _Section 10.2_, promptly and in no event
later than five (5) Business Days after the amount payable, if any, by Buyer
to a Contributor Indemnified Party in connection with an Indemnity Claim is
finally determined in accordance with this Agreement, Buyer will pay to each
relevant Contributor Indemnified Party such amount, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (or as otherwise directed pursuant to any final
and nonappealable

 



      
 

 



 

Order or as otherwise agreed by the Claiming Party and the Responding Party)
to an account designated by such Contributor Indemnified Party.

 



 

(b) Promptly and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the
amount payable, if any, by Contributor to a Buyer Indemnified Party in
connection with an Indemnity Claim, subject to the limitations in Section
10.2, or to the Partnership in connection with the Excess Adjustment Amount,
as applicable, is finally determined in accordance with this Agreement (the "
** _Valuation Date_** "), Contributor shall surrender to such Buyer
Indemnified Party (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Partnership)
Common Units with a value equal to such finally determined amount (valued in
accordance with this _Section 10.7(b)_). On the Valuation Date, the value of
a Common Unit shall be equal to the volume-weighted average price of a share
of Buyer Class A Common Stock on the NASDAQ for the 20 trading days
immediately prior to the Valuation Date, as reported by Bloomberg. For the
avoidance of doubt, any transfer of Reserved Units by Contributor to a Buyer
Indemnified Party (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Partnership)
shall include the applicable number of Common Units and a corresponding number
of shares of Buyer Class C Common Stock, with all value being ascribed to the
Common Units and no value being ascribed to the shares of Buyer Class C Common
Stock. If the Buyer Indemnified Party receiving the Reserved Units is either
the Partnership or Buyer, then the Partnership and Buyer, simultaneously with
such release, will cancel the applicable Common Units and shares of Buyer
Class C Common Stock, respectively.

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 10.7(c)_, prior to the
Expiration Date, Contributor shall retain and not transfer, or assign, to any
Person or pledge or otherwise subject to any Lien, other than to a Buyer
Indemnified Party in accordance with this _Article X_ or the Partnership in
accordance with Section 2.6, 16,000,000 Common Units and 16,000,000 shares of
Buyer Class C Common Stock (collectively, the " ** _Reserved Units_** " and
each reference to a "Reserved Unit" meaning one Common Unit and one share of
Buyer Class C Common Stock). To the extent certificated, the Reserved Units
shall be imprinted with a legend sufficient to identify the restriction on
transfer thereof set forth in this _Section 10.7(c)_ (the " ** _Restrictive
Legend_** "). The restriction on transfer set forth in the first sentence of
this _Section 10.7(c)_ shall terminate with respect to, and the Restrictive
Legend shall be removed from, (i) 8,000,000 Reserved Units upon the first
(1st) anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) any remaining Reserved Units
upon the Expiration Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that such restrictions on
transfer shall not be terminated with respect to, and the Restrictive Legend
shall not be removed from, the Reserved Units equal in value (valued in
accordance with this _Section 10.7(c)_ to the amount of Losses asserted with
respect to any Indemnity Claim in accordance with this Agreement that is
asserted prior to any such date and is still pending on any such date (a " **
_Pending Claim_** "); _provided_ , _further_ , that a Pending Claim shall
cease to be a Pending Claim upon the date that is 90 days following the date
the Indemnity Claim to which such Pending Claim relates is asserted, unless
Buyer shall have initiated a Proceeding in respect of such Indemnity Claim
prior to such date. Upon the resolution of each Pending Claim (or upon such
Pending Claim ceasing to be a Pending Claim), subject to the occurrence of the
Expiration Date, the restriction on transfer set forth in the first sentence
of this _Section 10.7(c)_ shall terminate with respect to, and the
Restrictive Legend shall be removed from, any Reserved Units not required to
be transferred to a Buyer Indemnified Party as payment with respect to such
Pending Claim. In the event that the restriction on transfer set forth in the
first sentence of this _Section 10.7(c)_ shall terminate with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to, and the Restrictive Legend is removed from, a Reserved Unit,
Contributor shall be permitted to transfer such Reserved Unit in accordance
with the AandR LP Agreement, the Common Unit and share of Buyer Class C Common
Stock formerly comprising such Reserved Unit shall cease to constitute a
Reserved Unit and such Common Unit and share of Buyer Class C Common Stock
shall no longer be available to the Buyer Indemnified Parties to satisfy an
Indemnity Claim by any of them.

 



 

10.8 **_Exclusive Remedy_**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, except in the case of Fraud, (a) this _Article
X_ shall be the sole remedy of the Buyer Indemnified Parties following the
Closing for any Losses arising out of, in connection with or related to this
Agreement or the Transactions and (b) the Reserved Units shall be the sole
source of payment to the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any Losses arising out
of, in connection with or related to this Agreement or the Transactions
(regardless of whether the value of the Reserved Units is sufficient to cover
any such Losses); _provided_ that this _Section 10.8_ shall not apply to any
claims arising out of, in connection with or related to the Ancillary
Agreements.

 



 

10.9 **_Waiver of Claims_**.

 



 

(a) Contributor and each Contributor Member each hereby waives, acquits,
forever discharges and releases, effective as of the Closing, on behalf of
itself, and its past, present and future stockholders, partners, members and
Representatives and each of their respective successors and assigns
(collectively, their respective " ** _Related Persons_** "), to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any and all Proceedings, causes of action, damages,
judgments, Liabilities and rights against the Company, whether absolute or
contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, known or unknown, determined,
determinable or otherwise, that Contributor and each Contributor Member or any
of their Related Persons has ever had, may now or hereafter have to the
extent, and only to the extent, arising from facts, occurrences or
circumstances existing at or prior to the Closing, in each case, relating to
the Company or its business, including pursuant to the Company LLC Agreement
(and any breaches thereof)whether in law or in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, in any capacity, including any claims to any additional Interests
in the Company or any distributions or payments (as consideration of services
or otherwise) from the Company by reason of any matter, cause or thing
whatsoever (the " ** _Contributor Released Claims_** "); _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Contributor Released Claims shall not
include any cause of action, damage, judgment, liability or right pursuant to
this Agreement as provided for and limited by this Article X or in the event
of Fraud. Contributor and each Contributor Member agrees not to, and to cause
its respective Related Persons not to, assert any Proceeding against Buyer or
any of its Affiliates with respect to the Contributor Released Claims.

 



 

(b) Each of the Buyer and the Company hereby waives, acquits, forever
discharges and releases, effective as of the Closing, on behalf of itself and
its past, present and future stockholders, partners, members and
Representatives and each of their respective successors and assigns
(collectively, their respective " ** _Buyer Related Persons_** "), to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any and all Proceedings, causes of action,
damages, judgments, liabilities and rights against Contributor and its Related
Persons, whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, known or
unknown, determined, determinable or otherwise, that the Buyer or the Company
or their respective Buyer Related Persons has ever had, may now or hereafter
have to the extent, and only to the extent, arising from facts, occurrences or
circumstances existing at or

 



      
 

 



 

prior to the Closing, in each case, relating to the ownership by Contributor
or its Related Persons of the Company or the business of the Company,
including pursuant to the Company LLC Agreement or predecessor agreements (and
any breaches thereof), whether in law or in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, in any capacity (the " ** _Company Released Claims_** ");
_provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Released Claims
shall not include any cause of action, damage, judgment, liability or right
pursuant to this Agreement as provided for and limited by this _Article X_,
pursuant to the Operator Agreement or in the event of Fraud. Each of the Buyer
and the Company agrees not to, and to cause its respective Buyer Related
Persons not to, assert any Proceeding against Contributor or its Related
Persons with respect to the Company Released Claims.

 



 

10.10 **_Access to Information_**.

 



 

(a) After the Closing Date, Contributor and Buyer shall grant to each other
(or their respective designees), and Buyer shall cause the Company to grant to
Contributor (or their respective designees), reasonable access at all
reasonable times to all of the Records of the Company in its possession or the
possession of the Company to the extent such Records are necessary to
Contributor in connection with any investigation or audit by a Governmental
Authority or any claim or dispute by or with any Person other than Buyer or
the Company. Buyer shall maintain, and shall cause the Company to maintain,
such Records until the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date (or for such
longer period of time as Contributor shall advise Buyer is necessary in order
to have Records available with respect to Tax matters), or if any of the
Records pertain to any claim or dispute pending on the seventh anniversary of
the Closing Date, Buyer shall maintain any of the Records designated by
Contributor or its Representatives until such claim or dispute is finally
resolved and the time for all appeals has been exhausted. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, in the event of a dispute between the
Parties, the furnishing of, or access to, the Records shall be subject to

 **ARTICLE XI 
MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

11.1 **_Notice_**.

 



 

(a) All notices, requests, demands, and other communications required or
permitted to be given or made hereunder by Buyer or Contributor (each a " **

or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, (c) delivered by
prepaid overnight courier service or (d) delivered by e-mail of a PDF

(b) Notices shall be effective and deemed received (i) if delivered personally
or sent by courier service, upon actual receipt by the intended recipient,

the date of delivery as shown by the return receipt therefor, or (iii) on the
date sent by e-mail if sent during normal business hours of the recipient, and
on the next Business Day if sent after normal business hours of the recipient.

 



 

11.2 **_Entire Agreement_**. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
supersede all prior discussions and agreements between the Parties and/or
their Affiliates with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the
sole and entire agreement between the Parties and their Affiliates with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

11.3 **_Expenses_**. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the Transactions are consummated, each Party will pay its own
costs and expenses incurred in anticipation of, relating to and in connection
with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the Transactions.

 



 

11.4 **_Disclosure_**. Unless the context otherwise requires, all capitalized
terms used in the Schedules shall have the respective meanings assigned to
such terms in this Agreement. Neither the Schedules, the exhibits nor any
disclosure made in or by virtue of them constitutes or implies any
representation, warranty, or covenant by Contributor, the Company or Buyer not
expressly set out in the Agreement, and neither the Schedules, the exhibits,
nor any such disclosure has the effect of, or may be construed as, adding to,
broadening, deleting from or revising the scope of any of the representations,
warranties, or covenants of Contributor, the Company or Buyer in the
Agreement. Any item or matter disclosed or listed on any particular Schedule
is deemed to be disclosed or listed on any other Schedule to the extent it is
reasonably apparent that such item relates or is applicable to, or is properly
disclosed under, such other Schedule or the section of this Agreement to which
such other Schedule corresponds, notwithstanding the fact that the Schedules
are arranged to correspond to the sections of the Agreement, that a particular
section of this Agreement makes reference to a particular Schedule, or that a
particular representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement may not make
reference to a Schedule. Matters reflected in the Schedules are not
necessarily limited to matters required by the Agreement to be reflected in
the Schedules. The fact that any item of information is contained in the
Schedules is not an admission of liability under any applicable Law, and does
not mean that such information is material, but rather is intended only to
qualify the representations, warranties and covenants in the Agreement and to
set forth other information required by the Agreement. Neither the
specification of any dollar amount in any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the
Schedules is intended to imply that such amount, or a higher or lower amount,
or the item so included, or any other item, is or is not material, and no
Party shall use the specification of any such amount or the inclusion of any
such item in any dispute or controversy between or among the Parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the
Schedules is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. The
information set forth on the Schedules or exhibits shall not be used as a
basis for interpreting the terms "material", "materially", "materiality",
"Material Adverse Effect", or any similar qualification in this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement. Neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Schedules is intended to imply that such
item or matter, or another item or matter, is or is not in the ordinary course
of business, and no Party shall use the specification or the inclusion of any
such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between or among the Parties
as to whether any obligation, item or matter described or not described herein
or included or not included in the Schedules is or is not in the ordinary
course of business for purposes of the Agreement. Headings have been inserted
in the Schedules for reference only and do not amend the descriptions of the
disclosed items set forth in the Agreement.

 



 

11.5 **_Waiver_**. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at
any time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such
waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly
executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. No
waiver by any Party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or
more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or
any other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion. All
remedies, either under this Agreement or by Law, will, subject to _Section
10.4_, be cumulative and not alternative.

 



 

11.6 **_Amendment_**. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified
only by a written instrument duly executed by Contributor and Buyer.

 



 

11.7 **_No Third Party Beneficiary_**. Except for the provisions of Sections
6.2(b), 6.6 and Article X (which are intended to be for the benefit of the
Persons identified therein), the terms and provisions of this Agreement are
intended solely for the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors
or permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of the Parties to confer
third party beneficiary rights upon any other Person; provided that only Buyer
and Contributor (and their respective successors and assigns) will have the
right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement on its behalf or on behalf
of any of its related indemnitees (but shall not be obligated to do so).

 



 

11.8 **_Assignment; Binding Effect_**. Any Party may assign its rights and
obligations hereunder to an Affiliate but such assignment shall not release
such Party from its obligations hereunder. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, neither this Agreement nor any right, interest or obligation
hereunder may be assigned by any Party without the prior written consent of
the other Party, and any attempt to do so will be void, except for assignments
and transfers by operation of Law. Subject to this _Section 11.8_, this
Agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of and is enforceable by the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

11.9 **_Headings_**. The headings used in this Agreement have been inserted
for convenience of reference only and do not modify, define or limit any of
the terms or provisions hereof.

 



 

11.10 **_Invalid Provisions_**. Upon any determination that any term or other
provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced
under any applicable rule of Law or public policy, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



      
 

 



 

11.11 **_Counterparts; Facsimile_**. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of
which together will constitute one and the same instrument. Any facsimile or
.pdf copies hereof or signature hereon shall, for all purposes, be deemed
originals.

 



 

11.12 **_Governing Law; Venue; and Jurisdiction_**.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Texas (without regard to any conflict of laws principles
thereof). Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions shall be brought
and determined by courts of the State of Texas located in Harris County and
the federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of
Texas, Southern District, and each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts solely in respect of any legal
proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement. The Parties further
agree that the Parties shall not bring suit with respect to any disputes
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions in any court or jurisdiction
other than the above specified courts; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not limit the rights of the Parties to obtain execution of
judgment in any other jurisdiction. The Parties further agree, to the extent
permitted by Law, that a final and nonappealable judgment against a Party in
any action or proceeding contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit
on the judgment, a certified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the
fact and amount of such judgment.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND WITH RESPECT TO ANY COUNTERCLAIM RELATED
THERETO.

 



 

11.13 **_Trust Account Waiver_**. Reference is made to the final prospectus of
Buyer, filed with the SEC (File No. 333-216409) (the " ** _Prospectus_** "),
and dated as of March 23, 2017. Each of Contributor, the Contributor Members
and the Company acknowledges that it has read the Prospectus and understands
that Buyer has established the Trust Account containing the proceeds of its
initial public offering (the " ** _IPO_** ") and from certain private
placements occurring simultaneously with the IPO initially in an amount of
approximately $1,035.0 million for the benefit of Buyers public stockholders
and certain parties (including the underwriters of the IPO) and that Buyer may
disburse monies from the Trust Account only: (a) to Buyers public
stockholders in the event they elect to exercise their Buyer Stockholder
Redemption Right, (b) to Buyers public stockholders if Buyer fails to
consummate a Business Combination within twenty-four (24) months from the
closing of the IPO, (c) to pay any income taxes with any interest earned on
the amounts held in the Trust Account or (d) to Buyer after or concurrently
with the consummation of a Business Combination. For and in consideration of
Buyer entering into this Agreement with Contributor, the Contributor Members
and the Company regarding the Transactions, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged,
each of Contributor, the Contributor Members and the Company hereby agrees on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates that, notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, it does not now and shall not at any time
hereafter have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any
monies in the Trust Account or distributions therefrom, or make

 



      
 

 



 

any claim against, the Trust Account, regardless of whether such claim arises
as a result of, in connection with or relating in any way to, any proposed or
actual business relationship between Buyer, Contributor, any of the
Contributor Members or the Company, this Agreement or any other matter, and
regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any
other theory of legal liability. Each of Contributor, the Contributor Members
and the Company hereby irrevocably waives any such claims it may have against
the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) now or in the future
as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements
with Buyer and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account (including any
distributions therefrom) for any reason whatsoever (including for an alleged
breach of this Agreement). Each of Contributor, the Contributor Members and
the Company agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material
to this Agreement and specifically relied upon by Buyer to induce it to enter
in this Agreement, and each of Contributor, the Contributor Members and the
Company further intends and understands such waiver to be valid, binding and
enforceable under applicable Law. To the extent Contributor, any of the
Contributor Members or the Company commences any action or proceeding based
upon, in connection with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to
Buyer, which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, monetary relief against
Buyer, Contributor, such Contributor Members or the Company hereby
acknowledges and agrees its sole remedy shall be against funds held outside of
the Trust Account and that such claim shall not permit Contributor, such
Contributor Members or the Company (or any party claiming on such Persons
behalf) to have any claim against the Trust Account (including any
distributions therefrom) or any amounts contained therein; _provided_ , that
(i) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit Contributors, the
Contributor Members or the Companys right to pursue a claim against Buyer
for legal relief against assets held outside the Trust Account, for specific
performance or other equitable relief, and (ii) nothing herein shall serve to
limit or prohibit any claims that the Contributor or the Company may have in
the future against Buyers assets or funds that are not held in the Trust
Account (including any funds that have been released from the Trust Account
and any assets that have been purchased or acquired with any such funds). In
the event Contributor, any of the Contributor Members or the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates commences any action or proceeding based upon, in
connection with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to Buyer,
which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, relief against the Trust Account
(including any distributions therefrom) or Buyers public stockholders,
whether in the form of money damages or injunctive relief, Buyer shall be
entitled to recover from Contributor, such Contributor Member or the Company,
as applicable, the associated legal fees and costs in connection with any such
action, in the event Buyer prevails in such action or Proceeding.

 



 

11.14 **_Attorney Waiver_**. Buyer agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of
its Subsidiaries and Representatives (including the Company following
Closing), that, following Closing, Bracewell LLP may serve as counsel to
Contributor and its Affiliates in connection with any matters related to this
Agreement and the Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and the Transactions, notwithstanding any
representation by Bracewell LLP of the Company prior to the Closing Date.
Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries and Representatives (including
the Company after Closing) hereby (a) consents to Bracewell LLPs
representation of Contributor and Contributors Affiliates in connection with
any matters related to this Agreement and the Transactions, (b) waives any
Claim it has or may have that Bracewell LLP has a conflict of interest or is
otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation based on its
representation of the Company prior to Closing and (c) agrees

 



      
 

 



 

that, in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer and/or the Company or
any of Buyers or the Companys respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and
Contributor and/or Contributors Affiliates, on the other hand, Bracewell LLP
may represent Contributor and/or Contributors Affiliates in such dispute even
though the interests of Contributor and Contributors Affiliates may be
directly adverse to Buyer or the Company or any of Buyers or the Companys
respective Affiliates and even though Bracewell LLP may have represented the
Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute. Buyer further
agrees that, as to all communications among Bracewell LLP, the Company,
Contributor or their respective Affiliates and Representatives prior to
Closing that relate in any way to this Agreement or the Transactions, the
attorney-client privilege belongs, to the extent such privilege exists, to
Contributor and its Affiliates and may be controlled by Contributor and its
Affiliates and will not, with respect to such privileged communications, pass
to or be claimed by Buyer or the Company or any of Buyers or the Companys
respective Affiliates. To the extent that Buyer, the Company, or any of
Buyers or the Companys respective Affiliates has or maintains any ownership
of the privilege with respect to these communications, Buyer agrees (on behalf
of itself), except as may be required by applicable Law, not to waive or to
attempt to waive the privilege without the express written approval of
Contributor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises
between Buyer or the Company, on the one hand, and any other Person (other
than Contributor and its Affiliates), on the other hand, after Closing, the
Company may assert the attorney-client privilege against such Person to
prevent disclosure of confidential communications by or with Bracewell LLP.
