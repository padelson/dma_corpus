capitalized terms used herein are defined in _Annex I_.

  



  

 **W I T N E S E T H:**

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , as of the date hereof, Olive owns all of the issued and
outstanding Shares (as defined below);

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , prior to the Closing, the Company, Parent and the Seller shall,
and shall cause their applicable Affiliates to, effect and carry out the
Restructuring Transactions, as set forth on _Exhibit_ _C_ hereof and, as a
result of the Restructuring Transactions, a newly-incorporated, direct,
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Olive (such Subsidiary, " _Holdco_ "), among other
things, shall become the owner of all issued and outstanding Shares and
thereafter the Company shall convert from a corporation to a limited liability
company;

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , promptly following its incorporation, Holdco shall become a
party to this Agreement as provided herein;

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , as of the Closing, Holdco will own all of the issued and
outstanding Interests; and

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , Olive wishes to cause the sale to Buyer, and Buyer wishes to
purchase, all of the Interests, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement;

  



  

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the foregoing recitals, and the
mutual promises herein made, and in consideration of the representations,
warranties and covenants herein contained, the Parties and Parent hereby agree
as follows:

  



  

 **A rticle I 
  
 PURCHASE AND SALE**

  



  

1.1 _Purchase and Sale_. On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Holdco shall sell, convey,
assign, transfer and deliver to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall purchase,
acquire and accept from Holdco, free and clear of all Liens (other than any
transfer restrictions arising under applicable securities Laws), all of
Holdco's right, title and interest in and to the Interests in exchange for the
consideration set forth in this _Article I_.

REQUEST. REDACTED MATERIAL IS MARKED WITH [***] AND HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY

(b) _plus_ Closing Date Cash,

  



  

(c) _minus_ Closing Date Debt,

  



  

(d) _minus_ the aggregate amount of all Unpaid Company Transaction
Expenses,

  



  

(e) _plus_ the amount (if any) by which the Estimated Net Working Capital
exceeds the Maximum Target Net Working Capital or _minus_ the amount (if any)
by which the Estimated Net Working Capital is less than the Minimum Target Net
Working Capital (an example of such calculations is referred to in additional
detail in _Exhibit A_ ).

  



  

The Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to _Section _
_1.3_ and the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

1.3 _Closing Date Estimates; Purchase Price Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall prepare and provide to the Buyer no later than five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date an estimated balance sheet of the
Company as of the Measuring Time (the " _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ "),
together with a written statement signed by the chief financial officer of the
Company (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable
detail its good faith estimated calculations of the Closing Date Debt, the
Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, the Closing Date Cash and the Net Working
Capital (such estimate, the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ ") and the
Purchase Price (the " _Estimated Purchase Price_ "). The Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing Statement will be prepared in
accordance with the definitions of Closing Date Debt, Unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses, Closing Date Cash, Net Working Capital and Purchase
Price herein, and with GAAP and the accounting principles, practices,
methodologies and policies applied by the Company in preparation of the
corresponding line items of the Most Recent Balance Sheet and Reference
Working Capital Statement (the " _Accounting Principles_ "), it being
understood that in the event of an inconsistency between GAAP and the
Accounting Principles, the Accounting Principles shall prevail. The Closing
Date payment to be made under _Section _ _1.4_ shall be calculated using the
Estimated Closing Statement and the Estimated Purchase Price reflected
therein. The Seller and its Representatives will make available or cause to
be made available to the Buyer and its Representatives prior to the Closing
Date all work papers and other books and records used in preparing the
Estimated Closing Statement, and provide reasonable access to members of its
accounting and financial staff in connection with the Buyer's review thereof.
The Seller will review any comments proposed by the Buyer with respect to the
Estimated Closing Statement, and will consider, in good faith, any appropriate
changes with respect to such comments, and adjust the Estimated Purchase Price
to reflect any agreed changes.

  



  

(b) As promptly as practicable and in any event within sixty (60) days
after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and
will provide to the Seller, a consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of
the Measuring Time (the " _Proposed Final Closing Balance Sheet_ "), together
with a written statement (the " _Proposed Final Closing Statement_ ") setting
forth in reasonable detail its proposed final determinations of the Closing
Date Debt, Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, Closing Date Cash, Net Working
Capital and Purchase Price. The Proposed Final Closing Balance Sheet and the
Proposed Final Closing Statement will be prepared in accordance with
definitions of Closing Date Debt, Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, Closing
Date Cash, Net Working Capital and Purchase Price herein, and with GAAP and
the Accounting Principles, it being understood that in the event of an
inconsistency between GAAP and the Accounting Principles, the Accounting
Principles shall prevail. The Buyer will cause the Company and its
Representatives to make available or cause to be made available to the Seller
and its Representatives all work papers and other books and records used in
preparing the Proposed Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed Final
Closing Statement, and provide reasonable access to members of its accounting
and financial staff in connection with the Seller's review thereof.

REQUEST. REDACTED MATERIAL IS MARKED WITH [***] AND HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY

(c) The Proposed Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed Final
Closing Statement (and the proposed final determinations of the Closing Date
Debt, Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, Closing Date Cash, Net Working
Capital and Purchase Price reflected thereon) will be final, conclusive and
binding on the Parties unless and to the extent the Seller provides a written
notice (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") to the Buyer no later than the forty-fifth
(45th) day after the delivery to the Seller of the Proposed Final Closing
Balance Sheet and the Proposed Final Closing Statement; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Seller may raise objections only on the basis that the amounts
reflected on the Proposed Final Closing Balance Sheet were not arrived at in
accordance with GAAP, the Accounting Principles or the applicable definitions
set forth herein, or were arrived at based on manifest mathematical or
clerical error. Any Dispute Notice must set forth in reasonable detail (i) any
item on the Proposed Final Closing Balance Sheet or the Proposed Final Closing
Statement which the Seller reasonably believes has not been prepared in
accordance with this Agreement and the disputed amount of such item and (ii)
the basis for the Seller's alternative calculation of each such item and the
resulting Purchase Price.

  



  

(d) The Buyer and the Seller will attempt to promptly resolve the matters
raised in the Dispute Notice in good faith. If the Buyer and the Seller do
not reach agreement in resolving all matters raised in the Dispute Notice
within twenty (20) days after delivery of the Dispute Notice pursuant to
_Section _ _1.3(c)_ , then the Buyer and the Seller shall submit any
remaining disputed items to EisnerAmper LLP or another nationally recognized
independent accounting firm chosen jointly by the Buyer and the Seller (any
such firm, the " _Accounting Firm_ "). In the event that EisnerAmper LLP has
not agreed to act as the Accounting Firm and an alternative Accounting Firm
has not been selected by mutual agreement of the Buyer and the Seller within
ten (10) Business Days following the date that was twenty (20) days after
delivery of the Dispute Notice, then the Buyer and the Seller shall each
promptly select an accounting firm and promptly cause such two accounting
firms to mutually select a third, nationally recognized independent accounting
firm to act as the Accounting Firm. Promptly, but in no event later than
thirty (30) days following its appointment, the Accounting Firm shall
determine (it being understood that in making such determination, the
Accounting Firm shall be functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator),
based solely on written submissions by the Buyer and the Seller and not by
independent review, only those items in dispute and shall render a written
report as to the resolution of the dispute and the resulting computation of
the Purchase Price, which determination shall be conclusive and binding on the
Parties. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm (i) shall be
bound by the Company's consistent application of GAAP and the provisions of
this _Section_ _1.3(d)_ and (ii) may not assign a value to any item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either Party. The aggregate fees,
costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated to and borne by
the Seller and the Company based on the inverse of the percentage that the
Accounting Firm's determination (before such allocation) bears to the total
amount of the total items in dispute as originally submitted to the Accounting
Firm; _provided_ that any initial engagement fee shall be borne fifty percent
(50%) each by the Seller and the Company, which amounts shall, following the
abovementioned final determination by the Accounting Firm, be re-allocated and
reimbursed to the applicable Party by the other Party, so that the amount of
such initial engagement fee shall have been paid in the proportion of the
allocation determined by the Accounting Firm in accordance with this _Section_
_1.3(d)_. For example, should the difference between the Seller's
calculations and the Buyer's calculations of the items in dispute total in
amount to $1,000 and the Accounting Firm awards $600 in favor of the Seller's
position, sixty percent (60%) of the costs of its review (including any
applicable portion of the Accounting Firm's initial engagement fee) would be
borne by the Company and forty percent (40%) (including any applicable portion
of the Accounting Firm's initial engagement fee) would be borne by the Seller.
During the review by the Accounting Firm, each Party agrees that it will, and
agrees to cause its independent accountants to, cooperate and assist in the
calculation of the Purchase Price and in the conduct of the review by the
Accounting Firm of any proposed calculations of the Purchase Price or the
components thereof, including the making available, to the extent necessary,
of books, records, work papers and personnel; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the accountants of the Seller or the Buyer shall not be obliged to make any
work papers available to the Accounting Firm except in accordance with such
accountants' normal disclosure procedures and then only after such firm has
signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants.

Withholding Party shall refund such amount to the Payment Recipient within a
reasonable period of time.

related statement of income of the Company for the fiscal year then ended (the
" _Annual Financial Statements_ "), (b) the balance sheet as of [***]

the revenues from sales of the TB and tick-borne disease testing Products, and
of the volume of sales of the TB testing Product, in each case for the seven-

fairly in all material respects the financial position of the Company and the
results of operations of the Company as of the respective dates thereof and

a Subsidiary of Parent, in accordance with the assumptions on _Schedule_ _2.5_
_(b)_ and (ii) were derived from the consolidated financial statements of
Parent that were prepared in accordance with GAAP, in accordance with the

sufficient to provide reasonable assurances (x) that all material transactions
are executed in accordance with management's general or specific
authorization, (y) that all material transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit the preparation of the Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP,
and (z) regarding the reliability of financial reporting. The Company is not,
and has never been, required to file any forms or reports with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Since [***], there has not been (1) any
significant deficiency or weakness in the system of internal accounting
controls used by the Company, (2) any fraud or willful misconduct by any
employee of the Company involved in or responsible for the preparation of
financial statements or (3) any written claim or allegation regarding any of
the foregoing. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has $30,000,000
in outstanding principal loans under the Company Credit Facility in the form
of term loans, and $0 outstanding under the Company Credit Facility in the
form of revolving loans. The minute books and the ownership record books of

Data Archive.

  



  

2.6 _Title to_ _Tangible_ ___Assets_ _; Condition_ _and Sufficiency_
_of_ _Tangible_ _Assets_. The Company has good and valid title to, or holds
pursuant to valid and binding leases, all of the tangible properties and
tangible assets reflected on the Most Recent Balance Sheet and that are used
by the Company in the conduct of the Business as of the date of this Agreement
and as of the Closing Date, except for any assets and properties that have
been sold or otherwise disposed of in the Ordinary Course of Business and not
in violation of this Agreement since the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date (the "
_Assets_ "). The Assets are not subject to any Liens other than Permitted
Exceptions and the Liens described on _Schedule _ _2.6_. Each item of
material tangible personal property included in the Assets is in all material
respects in good operating condition and state of repair (ordinary wear and
tear excepted). The Assets constitute all of the tangible assets needed to
operate the Business and all of the tangible properties and assets forming a
part of, used or held in, the Business and, on the Closing Date (assuming
receipt of all relevant Governmental Body approvals and completion of the
Restructuring Transactions), the Assets will, taking into account the rights
granted and the services to be performed pursuant to the Supply Agreement and
the Transitional Services Agreement, constitute all of the tangible assets,
rights and properties necessary for the Company to conduct the Business, in
each case in all material respects as the Business is conducted by the Company
as of the date of this Agreement and as of immediately prior to the Closing.
This _Section _ _2.6_ does not relate to (a) Intellectual Property, such
items being instead the subject of _Section _ _2.12_ and (b) inventory, such
item being instead the subject of _Section _ _2.25_.

accordance with its terms and with all applicable Laws, except to the extent
any noncompliance would not reasonably be expected to result in Liability to
the Company following the Closing. Except as would not reasonably be expected
to result in Liability to the Company following the Closing, no non-exempt
"prohibited transaction" (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code) has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur with

or Section 302 of ERISA (including any "multiemployer plan" within the meaning
of Section (3)(37) of ERISA), (ii) except for any "multiple employer plan"
created by the Company or to which the Company otherwise becomes subject
before Closing to allow Continuing Employees to continue to participate in an
Employee Plan following Closing, a "multiple employer plan" as defined in

within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA.

  



  

(d) Each Employee Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS (or the
prototype or volume submitter plan on which such Employee Plan is based has
received an opinion or advisory letter from the IRS) upon which it may rely
regarding the qualified status under the Code of such Employee Plan, and the
trust related thereto is exempt from United States federal income Tax under
Section 501 of the Code and, to the Company's Knowledge, nothing has occurred
since the receipt of such determination letter or opinion or advisory letter
that would reasonably be expected to result in the loss of such qualification
or material Liability to the Company after the Closing.

Affiliates, subject the Company to any material tax, fine, lien, penalty or
other liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or other Laws.

employee or former employee of the Company that provides or could provide for

conditions on, the ownership or operation by the Buyer, its Affiliates or the
Company of any portion of the business or assets of the Buyer or its
Affiliates, or the Company, or compel the Buyer or its Affiliates, or the
Company, to dispose of, hold separate or license any portion of the business,
assets or Intellectual Property of the Buyer or its Affiliates, or the
Company, respectively, in each case as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents.

Company nor any of its Representatives shall, without the Buyer's prior
written consent in the Buyer's sole discretion, discuss or commit to any
divestiture transaction, or discuss or commit to alter their businesses or
commercial practices in any way, or otherwise discuss, take or commit to take
any action that limits the Buyer's freedom of action with respect to, or the

respective businesses, product lines or assets or otherwise receive the full
benefits of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) Each of the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller and the Company,

any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental Body (including a
Governmental Antitrust Entity) relating to the matters that are the subject of
this Agreement and, to the extent practicable and legally permitted, permit
the other to review in advance any proposed communication by such party to any
such Governmental Body. Neither the Buyer, on the one hand, nor the Seller or
the Company, on the other hand, shall (or permit any of their respective
Affiliates to) agree to participate in any in-person meeting or any material
communication scheduled reasonably in advance, in each case with any
Governmental Body (including a Governmental Antitrust Entity) in respect of
any filings, investigation (including any settlement of the investigation),
litigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other in advance and,
to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body, gives the other the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting or material
communication. The Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller and the Company, on
the other hand, will promptly provide each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
Representatives or Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Governmental Body or
members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and

Representatives, upon reasonable notice, with reasonable access during normal
business hours to the offices, properties, personnel, books and records of the

Representatives such additional information as the Buyer and its
Representatives may reasonably request from time to time; _provided_ ,

considerations, any other prior access or review by the Buyer or its
Representatives to the same or substantially similar information or documents
in such offices, properties, personnel, books and records. Nothing contained
in this _Section_ _5.2_ shall obligate the Company or any of its Affiliates
to, in the Company's discretion, (i) breach any duty of confidentiality owed
to any Person (whether such duty arises contractually, statutorily or
otherwise), Law or any Contract with any other Person, (ii) waive any
privileges, including the attorney-client privilege, (iii) share any
information which constitutes trade secrets or other competitively sensitive
information, or (iv) cause significant competitive harm to the Company or
their businesses if the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated;
_provided_ that the Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to provide such access and
information in a manner that would not breach any such duty of
confidentiality, result in sharing such competitively sensitive information or
causing such competitive harm. Prior to the Closing, when accessing any
offices, facilities or properties of the Company, the Buyer shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates and Representatives to, comply with all safety and
security requirements for such office, facility or property as communicated to
them. All requests for information made pursuant to this _Section_ _5.2_ shall
be directed to Karen Koski or such other Person or Persons as may be
designated by the Company, and the Buyer shall not directly or indirectly
contact any officer, director, employee, agent or Representative of any of the
Seller, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates without the prior
approval of such designated Person(s). If so reasonably requested by the
Seller or the Company, the Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (as
applicable) to, enter into a customary joint defense agreement with the
Seller, the Company or their Affiliates with respect to any information to be
provided to the Buyer pursuant to this _Section_ _5.2_.

5.5 _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) In addition to the obligations pursuant to the terms of the Non-
Disclosure Agreement, dated as of October 25, 2017, by and between the Buyer
and Olive (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), from the Closing Date until
the [***] anniversary of the Closing Date, each Party shall not and, as
applicable, shall direct its directors, officers, employees and Affiliates not
to, (i) directly or indirectly, disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate to
any Person other than (A) authorized officers, directors and employees of the
other Parties and their respective Affiliates, and (B) advisors or consultants
of the other Parties and their respective Affiliates, in each case who have a
need to know such information and are bound by obligations of confidentiality
with regards to such information, or (ii) use or otherwise exploit for its own
benefit or for the benefit of anyone (other than the other Parties), any
Confidential Information. No Party shall have any obligation to keep
confidential (or direct its directors, officers, employees and Affiliates to
keep confidential) any Confidential Information if and to the extent
disclosure thereof is specifically required by applicable Law or in the course
of any audit or any general examination of such Party's books and records by
any securities, Tax or other regulatory authority; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the event disclosure is required by applicable Law or such audit or
examination, such Party shall, to the extent reasonably possible, provide the
Party that owns such Confidential Information with prompt notice of such
requirement prior to making any disclosure so that such Party may seek an
appropriate protective order. " _Confidential Information_ " means any
information primarily related to the business or activities of a Party and its
Affiliates disclosed to the other Party in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including methods of operation, customer
lists, products, prices, fees, costs, technology, inventions, trade secrets,
know-how, software, marketing methods, plans, personnel, suppliers,
competitors, markets or other specialized information or proprietary matters,
in each case to the extent existing as of immediately prior to the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties shall have no obligation hereunder
with respect to information (A) that is generally available to the public on
the date of this Agreement, (B) that becomes generally available to the public
other than as a result of a disclosure not otherwise permissible hereunder, or
(C) primarily relating to its own assets or liabilities, or to its own
business or activities as conducted after the Closing (except to the extent
the same are conducted for the primary benefit of the other Party or its
Affiliates). Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Confidential Information of
the Business (excluding any Confidential Information included in the Excluded
Assets or that is required for the conduct of the business of the Seller and
its Affiliates as conducted at Closing), regardless of whether such
information was already known by the Seller or any of its Affiliates prior to
or as of the Closing, constitutes the Confidential Information of the Buyer
and shall be subject to the obligations and restrictions as to use and
confidentiality set forth in _Section_ _5.5_. In the event of a conflict
between the terms of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, the
terms of this Agreement shall govern.

  



  

(b) The Parties specifically acknowledge and agree that the remedy at law
for any breach of the foregoing will be inadequate, and that each Party and
its Affiliates shall be entitled to seek any injunctive or other equitable
relief, including the issuance of a temporary restraining order from any court
of competent jurisdiction to prevent or address any violation or threatened
violation of this _Section_ _5.5_ without the necessity of proving actual
damage or posting any bond whatsoever, or providing notice, to the maximum
extent permitted by Law, and each Party hereby agrees not to raise any
objection or legal or equitable defense to the availability of the equitable
remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches of this
Agreement by another Party and its Affiliates. The rights and remedies
provided by this _Section_ _5.5_ are cumulative and in addition to any other
rights and remedies that a Party may have hereunder or at law or in equity.

the threat of institution of any Legal Proceeding against it or its Affiliates

in each case contained in this Agreement, any other Seller Document or any
other Company Document, shall not be affected by any investigation conducted
at any time, or any knowledge acquired, capable of being acquired, or which is
alleged the applicable Party should have known, at any time, whether before or
after the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or
compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, and
(ii) the waiver of any condition to Closing based on the accuracy of any such
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
such covenant or agreement, shall not affect the right to indemnification or
any other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements.

  



  

7.3 _Indemnification Procedures_. (a) A claim for indemnification for
any matter not including a Third Party Claim may be asserted by reasonably
specific written notice to the Party from whom indemnification is sought,
describing the essential circumstances claimed to constitute the indemnified
Losses, to the extent known or reasonably expected at such time, and which
notice shall be provided before the indemnified party incurs substantial
expense with respect to responding to said Losses (except where exigent
circumstances require an immediate response); _provided_ , _however_ , that
failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not preclude the indemnified
party from any indemnification which it may claim in accordance with this
_Article VII_ , except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually
and materially prejudiced thereby. After such initial written notice, the
indemnified shall provide additional information and details in response to
all reasonable requests from the indemnifying party to the extent the
indemnified party has knowledge of such information and details.

(b) In the event of any Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall
promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any Third Party Claim of
which it has knowledge that is covered by this _Article VII_ to be forwarded
to the indemnifying party (describing the factual basis for the Third Party
Claim and the estimated amount of the Third Party Claim, in each case, in
reasonable detail in light of the facts to the extent then known by the
indemnified party), and which notice shall be provided before the indemnified
party incurs substantial expense with respect to responding to said Losses
(except where exigent circumstances require an immediate response); _provided_
, _however_ , that the failure of the indemnified party to give reasonably
prompt notice of any Third Party Claim shall not preclude the indemnified
party from any indemnification which it may claim in accordance with this
_Article VII_ , except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually
and materially prejudiced thereby. After such initial written notice, the
indemnified party shall provide additional information and details in response
to all reasonable requests from the indemnifying party to the extent the
indemnified party has knowledge of such information and details. Subject to
the provisions of this _Section _ _7.3(b)_ , the indemnifying party shall
have the right, at its sole expense, to be represented by counsel of its
choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and to
control the defense of, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third
Party Claim that relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the indemnifying party shall, within fifteen
(15) Business Days after such indemnified party's notice of the Third Party
Claim has been given to the indemnifying party (or sooner, if the nature of
the Third Party Claim so requires), notify the indemnified party of such
election, together with an acknowledgment in writing to the indemnified party
of its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party to the extent of any
Losses actually suffered by the indemnified party in connection with such
Third Party Claim pursuant to the terms and conditions of this _Article VII_.
If, with respect to a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party (i) elects not
to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party
Claim that relates to any Losses indemnifiable against hereunder, (ii) fails
to comply with the terms of this _Section_ _7.3(b)_ which are required in
order to defend such Third Party Claim, (iii) contests its obligation to
indemnify the indemnified party for such Losses under this Agreement or (iv)
fails to actively and diligently conduct the defense of such Third Party
Claim, then the indemnified party may control the defense of, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim on the terms set forth in
this _Section_ _7.3(b)_. If the indemnified party controls the defense of any
Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall, subject to the limitations
set forth in this _Article VII_ , reimburse the indemnified party for the
reasonable and documented fees and expenses of defending such Third Party
Claim, upon submission of periodic bills. If the indemnifying party assumes
the defense of any Third Party Claim, the indemnified party may participate,
at his, her or its own expense, in the defense of such Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such indemnified party shall be entitled to
participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the
indemnifying party (subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article VII_
) if (A) so requested by the indemnifying party to participate or (B) based on
the reasonable opinion of outside counsel to the indemnified party, a conflict
of interest or potential conflict of interest exists between the indemnified
party and the indemnifying party that would make such separate representation
advisable; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the indemnifying party shall not
be required to pay for more than the reasonable and documented fees and
expenses of one such counsel, in addition to any local counsel reasonably
required, for all indemnified parties in connection with any Third Party
Claim. The Parties agree to provide reasonable access to one another to such
documents and information as may be reasonably requested in connection with
the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third Party Claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, the indemnifying party shall not,
without the written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), permit a default or consent
to entry of any judgment, or settle, compromise, or offer to settle or
compromise, any Third Party Claim unless it includes an unconditional release
of the indemnified party and would not result in (1) the imposition of an
Order that would restrict future activity or conduct of the indemnified party
or any of its Affiliates, (2) a finding or admission of a violation of Law or
violation of the rights of any Person by the indemnified party or any of its
Affiliates or (3) a finding or admission that would have a material adverse
effect on other claims made or threatened against the indemnified party or any
of its Affiliates, to the extent the existence of such claims are disclosed to
the indemnifying party by the indemnified party, or are otherwise known to the
indemnifying party. The indemnifying party shall not have the right to control
the defense of any Third Party Claim nor any right to consent to any
settlement or compromise of a Third Party Claim if (I) such Third Party Claim
seeks an injunction or other equitable remedies in respect of the indemnified
party or its business, (II) such Third Party Claim involves as a counterparty,
a customer, supplier or other partner of the indemnified party or any of its
Subsidiaries, the loss of the commercial relationship with whom would be
materially adverse to the business of such indemnified party, (III) such Third
Party Claim involves a criminal or regulatory proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation, (IV) such Third Party Claim involves an
investigation or inquiry by any Governmental Body, or (V) such Third Party
Claim has, in the good faith judgment of the indemnified party, a reasonable
risk of resulting in Losses (when aggregated with other realized Losses or
potential Losses that relate to indemnification claims that have been made
under this _Article VII_ ) that would exceed the amount of Losses for which
indemnification would be available pursuant to this Agreement.

(c) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been
rendered by a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction and the expiration
of the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been
consummated, or the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have
arrived at a mutually binding agreement, in each case, with respect to any
Third Party Claim hereunder, the indemnified party shall forward to the
indemnifying party notice of any sums due and owing by the indemnifying party
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter and the indemnifying
party shall pay, or instruct the Escrow Agent to pay on its behalf, as
applicable, to the extent that indemnification is available for such amounts
pursuant to this Agreement, subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Article VII_ , all of such remaining sums so due and owing to the indemnified
party from the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement, as applicable.

  



  

7.4 _Limitations on Indemnification for Breaches of Representations
and Warranties_.

  



  

(a) Absent actual and intentional fraud, neither the Seller nor Parent
shall be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party under _Section
7.2(a)(i)_ (i) for any Loss unless the amount of such Loss with respect to any
individual matter, or group of matters arising out of the same or
substantially similar set of facts, circumstances or events exceeds $15,000,
and any individual Losses disregarded pursuant to this clause (i) shall not be
applied toward the Basket below and the determination of the maximum liability
under _Section_ _7.4(c)_ _(i)_ and (ii) unless the aggregate amount of Losses
incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties and indemnifiable hereunder exceeds
the Basket, and then only to the extent of such excess; _provided_ , _however_
, that the foregoing limitations shall not apply to Losses based upon,
attributable to or resulting from a breach of or inaccuracy of the Company
Fundamental Representations.

  



  

(b) Absent actual and intentional fraud, neither the Seller nor Parent
shall be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party under _Section_
_7.2(a)_ _(i)_ for any aggregate amount of Losses exceeding the amount in the
Escrow Account at the applicable time, and the amounts in the Escrow Account
shall be the Buyer Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive source for the
Seller's and Parent's indemnification obligations under _Section_ _7.2(a)_
_(i)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing limitation shall not apply
to Losses based upon, attributable to or resulting from a breach of or
inaccuracy of the Company Fundamental Representations.

  



  

(c) Other than in the case of Losses based upon or arising out of acts of
actual and intentional fraud of an indemnifying party (where the indemnified
parties' rights shall not be limited by anything set forth in this Agreement
to the contrary), in no event shall (i) the aggregate amount for which the
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be indemnified and held harmless under
_Section_ _7.2(a)_ (including in the case of breach of the Company Fundamental
Representations) exceed the Final Purchase Price actually received by the
Seller and (ii) the aggregate amount for which the Seller Indemnified Parties
shall be indemnified and held harmless under _Section_ _7.2(b)_ exceed the
Final Purchase Price actually received by the Seller.

(d) The Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified
Party for any otherwise indemnifiable Loss to the extent the matter giving
rise to such Loss had been reserved or provided for in the Final Closing
Statement and had been deducted in computing the Purchase Price, or to the
extent of any item for which any Buyer Indemnified Party has been otherwise
compensated through any adjustment to the Purchase Price under _Section_
_1.3_.

  



  

(e) Each indemnified party shall take all commercially reasonable actions
to mitigate all Losses; _provided_ , _however_ , that no indemnified party
shall be required to make or pursue any claims for insurance or other payments
available from third parties with respect to Losses for which it seeks
indemnification hereunder. In the event that an indemnified party pursues any
claims for insurance or other payments available from third parties with
respect to Losses for which it seeks indemnification hereunder, then the
amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided for under this
Agreement shall be reduced by any insurance proceeds or other amounts actually
recovered by such indemnified party with respect to such Losses. To the
extent such proceeds or amounts are recovered or realized after an
indemnifying party makes an indemnification payment hereunder with respect to
such Losses, the indemnified party shall promptly remit such amounts to the
indemnifying party.

  



  

(f) Following the Closing, the remedies set forth in this _Article VII_
shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedies for money damages with
respect to breaches by the Parties of any of the terms of this Agreement or
any other Ancillary Document (except to the extent otherwise expressly
provided in any such other Ancillary Document), and shall be in lieu of any
other remedies for money damages that may be available to the Parties with
respect to any Losses of any kind or nature incurred directly or indirectly
resulting from or arising out of this Agreement or the applicable Ancillary
Documents (it being understood that nothing in this _Section_ _7.4(f)_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall affect any Party's right to specific
performance or other similar non-monetary equitable remedies to the extent
expressly provided in this Agreement). The Parties each hereby waive any
provision of any applicable Law (including actions under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and any analogous
state statutes) to the extent that it would limit or restrict the agreement
contained in this _Section_ _7.4(f)_.

  



  

(g) For purposes of determining the inaccuracy or breach of any
representations or warranties and calculating the amount of Losses
indemnifiable hereunder as a result of any such inaccuracy or breach, any
reference to materiality or Material Adverse Effect in the representations and
warranties shall be disregarded; _provided_ that the foregoing limitations
shall not apply, for purposes of determining the inaccuracy or breach of the
applicable representations or warranties, with respect to the use of any such
references (i) as incorporated in the definitions of "Listed Company Contract"
or "Permitted Exceptions," (ii) in any clause in _Section_ _5.3_ that is
incorporated by reference in [***], or (iii) in _Section_ _2.5_ , _Section_
_2.7_ _(b)_ , [***].

  



  

7.5 _Escrow Account_.

  



  

(a) To secure and to serve as recourse in respect of (i) any
indemnification obligations owed to any Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to
this _Article VII_ , if any, and (ii) any payment or partial payment to the
Company of adjustments to the Purchase Price calculated in accordance with
_Article I_ , at the Closing, the Buyer shall deposit into the Escrow Account,
on behalf of the Seller and Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the Escrow Amount, by deducting such amount from the Estimated Purchase
Price otherwise payable at Closing, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(b) On the [***] anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _First Escrow
Release Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall, and the Buyer shall cause the Escrow
Agent to, release to the Seller the lesser of (i) [***] and (ii) the amount,
if any, remaining in the Escrow Account (including any accumulated interest
thereon) _minus_ the amount of claims for indemnification under this _Article
VII_ (other than claims made pursuant to _Section_ _7.2(b)_ ) asserted but not
yet resolved (" _Escrow Unresolved Claims_ ") on or prior to the First Escrow
Release Date. Each portion of the Escrow Account retained for Escrow
Unresolved Claims pursuant to this _Section_ _7.5(b)_ shall be released by the
Escrow Agent (to the extent not utilized to pay the Buyer Indemnified Parties
for any such claims resolved in favor of the Buyer Indemnified Parties) in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement upon the later of (A) the
resolution of the applicable Escrow Unresolved Claims in accordance with this
_Article VII_ and (B) the Final Escrow Release Date.

  



  

(c) On the [***] anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Final Escrow
Release Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall, and the Buyer shall cause the Escrow
Agent to, release to the Seller the excess, if any, of (i) the amount, if any,
remaining in the Escrow Account (including any accumulated interest thereon)
_over_ (ii) the amount of Escrow Unresolved Claims existing on or prior to the
Final Escrow Release Date. Each portion of the Escrow Account retained for
Escrow Unresolved Claims pursuant to this _Section_ _7.5(c)_ shall be released
by the Escrow Agent (to the extent not utilized to pay the Buyer Indemnified
Parties for any such claims resolved in favor of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties) upon the resolution of the applicable Escrow Unresolved Claims, in
accordance with this _Article VII_ and the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(d) In the case of a Buyer Indemnified Party's rights to indemnification
pursuant to this _Article VII_ , for as long as there are funds available in
the Escrow Account to cover the Buyer Indemnified Parties' indemnifiable
Losses pursuant to _Section_ _7.2(a)(i)_ , any and all Losses payable by the
Seller or Parent to the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to such
indemnifiable Losses will be paid in cash first out of the Escrow Account, and
in the event any Losses that are not otherwise limited by _Section_ _7.4(b)_
exceed, or are not paid and satisfied in full from, the Escrow Account, such
Losses will be paid directly by the Seller or Parent to the applicable Buyer
Indemnified Parties; _provided_ that, in the event any Losses based upon,
attributable to or resulting from breaches or inaccuracies of Company
Fundamental Representations have reduced the funds available in the Escrow
Account, Seller or Parent shall, upon the request of the Buyer, transfer
immediately available funds to the Escrow Agent for deposit into the Escrow
Account, up to an amount equal to the Losses paid from the Escrow Account in
respect of such Company Fundamental Representations.

  



  

7.6 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Tax Indemnification_. The Seller and Parent each agrees, jointly
and severally, to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties
from and against the amount of any and all Losses, without duplication
(including without duplication of any amounts indemnified pursuant to
_Section_ _7.2_ ), in respect of: (i) Taxes of the Company (or any predecessor
thereof) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (with such Taxes in respect of a
Straddle Tax Period determined as provided in _Section_ _7.6(c)_ ); (ii) Taxes
imposed on the Company (A) by reason of being or having been a member of an
affiliated, combined, consolidated or unitary group with another Person on or
prior to the Closing Date by reason of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6
(or any analogous or similar provision of Law), or (B) by reason of being or
having been a transferee or successor, or (C) by contract, assumption,
operation of Law or otherwise (limited in the case of clauses (B) and (C) to
Liability for Taxes relating to or arising out of an action, event or
transaction occurring, or existing, on or before the Closing Date); (iii) the
failure of any of the representations and warranties contained in _Section_
_2.8_ , _Section_ _2.11(g)_ , _Section_ _2.11(i)_ and _Section_ _2.11(j)_ to
be true and correct in all respects; (iv) the failure of Olive or Holdco to
perform any covenant contained in this Agreement with respect to Taxes; (v)
Transfer Taxes for which the Seller is responsible pursuant to _Section_
_7.6(f)_ ; and or (vi) Taxes imposed in connection with the Restructuring
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller and Parent shall not
have any obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this
_Section_ _7.6(a)_ to the extent that any such Loss arises solely as a result
of a violation by Buyer of _Section_ _7.6(m)_.

(b) _Filing of_ _Tax_ _Returns; Payment of Taxes_.

  



  

(i) The Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to
be filed, all Tax Returns of the Company (A) due on or prior to the Closing
Date and (B) due after the Closing Date that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period (other than any Tax Return relating to a Straddle Tax Period as
provided in _Section_ _7.6(b)(ii)_ ), and the Seller shall pay or cause to be
paid all Taxes shown due thereon. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with the past practice of the Company's Tax Return
preparation in the Ordinary Course of Business, except as otherwise required
by Law. The Seller shall provide the Buyer with copies of completed drafts of
any Income Tax Returns prepared pursuant to this _Section_ _7.6(b)(i)_
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any such Income Tax Return to be filed
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date) at least fifteen (15)
Business Days prior to the due date for filing thereof, and such other
material Tax Returns at least three (3) Business Days prior to the due date
for filing thereof, along with supporting work papers, for the Buyer's review
and approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

  



  

(ii) After the Closing, the Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and the Company shall file or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns of the
Company relating to a Straddle Tax Period, and, subject to the rights to
payment from the Seller pursuant to this _Section_ _7.6(b)(ii)_ , the Company
shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown due thereon. All such Tax
Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the past practice of the
Company's Tax Return preparation in the Ordinary Course of Business, except as
otherwise required by Law. The Buyer shall provide the Seller with copies of
completed drafts of Income Tax Returns prepared pursuant to this _Section_
_7.6(b)(ii)_ at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the due date for
filing thereof, and such other Tax Returns at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the due date for filing thereof, along with supporting work papers,
for the Seller's review and approval, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. Promptly, but in no event later than thirty
(30) days following the due date for the payment of Taxes with respect to any
Tax Return that the Buyer has the responsibility to prepare pursuant to this
_Section_ _7.6(b)(ii)_ , the Seller or Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to
the Buyer the amount of any Liability for Taxes shown on such Tax Returns
prepared by Buyer and owed by the Seller or Parent pursuant to the provisions
of _Section_ _7.6(a)_. No payment pursuant to this _Section_ _7.6(b)(ii)_
shall excuse the Seller or Parent from their indemnification obligations
pursuant to _Section_ _7.6(a)_ if the amount of Taxes as ultimately determined
(on audit or otherwise) for the periods covered by such Tax Returns exceeds
the amount of the Seller's payment under this _Section_ _7.6(b)(ii)_.

  



  

(c) _Straddle_ _Tax_ _Period Tax Allocation_. The Company shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, close the taxable period of the
Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date. If applicable Law
does not permit the Company to close its taxable year as of the close of
business on the Closing Date, and in any case in which a Tax is assessed with
respect to a taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing
Date (a " _Straddle_ _Tax_ _Period_ "), the amount of such Taxes of the
Company based on or measured by income, sales, use, receipts or similar items
(other than property and ad valorem Taxes) of the Company for the portion of
the Straddle Tax Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined based
on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing
Date, and the amount of any other Taxes, and any exemptions, allowances or
deductions, that relates to the portion of the Straddle Tax Period ending on
and including the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax,
exemption, allowance, or deduction for the entire taxable period multiplied by
a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in such Straddle Tax Period.

(d) _Refunds and Credits_. The Seller shall be entitled to receive
from the Buyer, the Company and their respective Affiliates the amount of any
Tax refunds (including any interest thereon), whether received as a cash
payment or as a credit against a Tax payment, attributable to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period of the Company, net of any costs, including Taxes, incurred to
obtain such Tax refund. The Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, any such net
amounts to the Seller within thirty (30) days after the receipt of any such
refund or the filing a Tax Return reflecting the use of such refund as a
credit against a Tax payment.

  



  

(e) _Tax_ _Proceedings_.

  



  

(i) If notice of any Tax Claim is received by the Buyer or the Company for
which the Seller and Parent may reasonably be expected to be liable pursuant
to _Section_ _7.6(a)_ , the notified Party shall promptly notify the Seller
and Parent in writing of such Tax Claim (including a copy of all
correspondence given to and received from any Governmental Body in connection
therewith); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of the notified Party to
give the Seller and Parent notice or copies as provided herein shall not
relieve the Seller or Parent of its obligations under this _Section_ _7.6_ ,
except to the extent that the Seller or Parent is actually and materially
prejudiced thereby.

  



  

(ii) The Seller and Parent shall have the right, at their sole expense, to
the extent such Tax Claim is subject to indemnification by the Seller and
Parent pursuant to _Section_ _7.6(a)_ , to represent the interests of the
Company in any such Tax Claim (other than a Tax Claim with respect to a Tax
Return in respect of a Straddle Tax Period, if Buyer is representing the
interests of the Company in accordance with the provision below); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Seller and Parent shall have elected in writing to
represent the interests of the Company and shall have acknowledged in writing
to the Buyer their obligation to indemnify the Buyer to the extent of any
Losses actually suffered by the Buyer in connection with such Tax Claim
pursuant to this _Section_ ___7.6_ , within fifteen (15) Business Days after
such notice of the Tax Claim has been given to the Seller and Parent. If the
Seller and Parent comply with the foregoing provision of this _Section_
_7.6(e)(ii)_ and have elected to represent the interests of the Company in
such Tax Claim, they shall conduct such representation actively and
diligently, shall periodically update the Buyer with respect to developments
related to such Tax Claim, and shall not settle such claim without the consent
of the Buyer, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. If the Seller and Parent do not elect to represent the interests
of the Company with respect to such Tax Claim or fail to comply with the terms
of this _Section_ _7.6(e)(ii)_ , or with respect to a Tax Claim that relates
to a Tax Return in respect of a Straddle Tax Period that is subject to
indemnification by the Seller and Parent pursuant to _Section_ _7.6(a)_ , the
Buyer may represent the interests of the Company, and the Seller and Parent
shall reimburse the Buyer for the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees
and expenses of defending such Tax Claim (based on a pro rata allocation of
such fees and expenses between the portion of the Straddle Tax Period that is
a Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion of the Straddle Tax Period that is a
Post-Closing Tax Period), upon submission of periodic bills; _provided_ that
the Buyer shall periodically update the Seller and Parent with respect to
developments related to such Tax Claim and the Buyer shall not settle such
claim without the consent of the Seller and Parent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. If the Seller or Parent assumes
the defense of any Tax Claim, the Buyer may participate, at its own expense,
in the defense of such Tax Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer
shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at
the expense of the Seller and Parent if (A) so requested by the Seller or
Parent to participate, or (B) based on the reasonable opinion of outside
counsel to the Buyer, a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest
exists between the Buyer and the Seller, Parent or Olive, as applicable, that
would make such separate representation advisable. Notwithstanding any
provision herein to the contrary, to the extent that a provision of this
_Section_ _7.6(e)(ii)_ directly conflicts with any provision of _Section_
_7.3_ , this _Section_ _7.6(e)(ii)_ shall govern.

recording, transfer or similar Taxes levied by any Taxing Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents (collectively, the " _Transfer Taxes_ "), if any, shall be

_7.6_ shall be resolved in accordance with _Section_ _9.4_. If any dispute
with respect to a Tax Return is not resolved prior to the due date of such Tax

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any obligation under this _Section_ _7.6_ shall
not terminate with respect to any Loss as to which the Person to be
indemnified shall have given written notice to the indemnifying party in
accordance with _Section_ _7.6_ before the termination of the applicable
survival period described in this _Section_ _7.6_.

  



  

(i) _Exclusivity_. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ _7.6_ shall
be the exclusive provision for indemnification claims by the Buyer Indemnified
Parties related to Tax matters, other than in respect of any breach of or
inaccuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ _2.5_
to the extent relating to Tax matters (which shall be subject to Section 7.2
and shall not be subject to this _Section_ _7.6_ ). In the event of a conflict
between the provisions of this _Section_ _7.6_ , on the one hand, and the
provisions of _Sections_ _7.1_ __ through _7.5_ , on the other hand, the
provisions of this _Section_ _7.6_ shall control; _provided_ that the
limitations set forth in (i) _Section_ _7.4(c)_ and _Section_ _7.4(d)_ shall
apply to any indemnification claims made pursuant to this _Section_ _7.6_ and

pursuant to this _Section_ _7.6_.

  



  

(j) _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. The Seller shall cause any
and all Tax allocation or Tax sharing agreements (except for commercial
Contracts entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business the primary purpose
of which is not Taxes, and containing customary Tax indemnification
provisions) between the Company, on the one hand, and any other Person, on the
other hand, to be terminated with effect as of the Closing Date such that on,
from and after the Closing Date, the Company shall not be obligated to make
any payment pursuant to any such agreement for any past or future period.

  



  

(k) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Each of the Parties shall, at its own
expense, reasonably cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
another Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns, and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other Party's request) the provision of
records during normal business hours and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

(l) _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Buyer shall prepare and deliver to
the Seller, within ninety (90) days after determination of the Final Purchase
Price, an allocation of the Purchase Price, as determined for Tax purposes,
including any Liabilities considered assumed by the Buyer for Tax purposes,
among the assets of the Company for U.S. federal income Tax purposes in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code, the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder and the methodology set forth on _Exhibit_ _D_ (the " _Purchase
Price Allocation_ "). The Purchase Price Allocation shall become final and
binding on the Parties hereto twenty (20) days after the Buyer provides such
schedule to the Seller, unless the Seller notifies the Buyer in writing that
it objects to the allocation set forth in the Purchase Price Allocation. The
Buyer and the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such
dispute within fifteen (15) days. In the event the Seller and the Buyer reach
a resolution within such time, the Seller and the Buyer (and any of their
applicable respective Affiliates) shall report consistently with the Purchase
Price Allocation in all Tax Returns, including IRS Form 8594, and neither the
Seller nor the Buyer (nor any of their applicable respective Affiliates) shall
take any position in any Tax Return that is inconsistent with the Purchase
Price Allocation, as agreed, in each case unless required to do so by a final
determination as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code. In the event,
however, that the Buyer and the Seller are unable to resolve such dispute
within fifteen (15) days, each Party shall be permitted to file its Tax
Return, including IRS Form 8594, in a manner it determines in its sole
discretion.

  



  

(m) _Post-Closing Actions_. After the Closing, except as otherwise
required by Law or as permitted under this _Section_ _7.6_ , the Buyer shall
not, and shall not cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to,
(i) amend any Tax Returns with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii)
file any Tax Returns in respect of a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than Tax
Returns in respect of a Straddle Tax Period filed pursuant to _Section_
_7.6(b)(ii)_ ) or (iii) make any Tax election or take any other action in
respect of Taxes that has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, in
each case without the prior written consent of the Seller (not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the Buyer shall have the right to file
or cause the Company to file any Tax Return [***], as reasonably determined by
the Buyer with respect to such Tax matters, and Buyer shall keep Seller
reasonably informed with the status of any such communications and agreements,
and shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments of Seller. For the
avoidance of doubt, no actions taken by the Buyer pursuant to the foregoing
proviso shall have any effect on the Buyer Indemnified Parties' rights to
indemnification pursuant to _Section_ _7.6(a)_.

  



  

(n) _Employer Identification Number_. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that, following the Conversion, the Company shall retain and continue to use
the employer identification number assigned to the Company prior to the
Conversion. In connection with the Conversion, Holdco shall apply for and
obtain a new employer identification number in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Treasury Regulations Section 301.6019-1(d)(2).

  



  

(o) _Massachusetts_ _S_ _ales and_ _U_ _se Tax Returns_. The Seller shall
file or cause to be filed all Massachusetts sales and use Tax Returns due with
respect to the taxable periods ending December 31, 2016, and December 31,
2017, and from January 1, 2018 through July 31, 2018, that have not been
filed, and shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes due with respect thereto
prior to the Closing.

  



  

7.7 _Tax Treatment of Payments_. The Parties agree to treat any
payment pursuant to _Article VII_ , any release payment from the Escrow
Account, or any other indemnity payment made pursuant to this Agreement as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for all income Tax purposes, as otherwise
required by applicable Law, or pursuant to the good faith resolution of a Tax
contest.

  



  

7.8 _No Subrogation_. The Seller hereby agrees that if, following the
date hereof, any payment is required to be made pursuant to _Section_ _7.2(a)_
, _Section_ _7.2(b)_ , or _Section_ _7.6_ , the Seller shall have no right
against the Company or its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents,
attorneys, representatives, assigns or successors, whether by reason of
subrogation, contribution, reimbursement or otherwise, in respect of any such
payments or Liabilities, and shall not take any action against the Company or
its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents, attorneys,
representatives, assigns or successors with respect thereto, except in the
event such Person's actual and intentional fraud resulted in such payment.

Each Party had its own counsel or access to counsel during the negotiation and

particular Party drafted the language at issue shall not be a consideration
when resolving any ambiguity in this Agreement. If provisions in this
Agreement conflict with provisions in a Schedule or Exhibit, the provisions of
this Agreement control, unless the Schedule or Exhibit expressly states that
it will control. Except where the context requires otherwise, whenever used
the singular includes the plural, the plural includes the singular, and the
term "including" or "includes" means including, without limiting the
generality of any description preceding that term. When this Agreement refers
to a number of days, unless otherwise specified as Business Days, that
reference is to calendar days. As used in this Agreement, the term "or" shall
not be exclusive and shall mean "and/or". The headings in this Agreement are
provided for convenience only and do not affect its meaning. Unless specified
otherwise, any reference to a statute means that statute and any successor
statute and regulations promulgated under it, all as amended or supplemented
from time to time.

1.3 _. Eligible Purchasers_

  



  

(a) _Eligible Purchasers_. Quest Diagnostics has the right to (i)
purchase Products for itself; (ii) purchase Products on behalf of any other
Eligible Purchasers; and (iii) authorize any other Eligible Purchasers to
purchase Products. Eligible Purchasers other than Quest Diagnostics are third
party beneficiaries under this Agreement, but only with respect to the
placement of Orders under this Agreement and payment therefor; provided,
however, Eligible Purchasers shall not have an independent right to enforce
the terms of this Agreement. Quest Diagnostics is the only Eligible Purchaser
that has the right to enforce (including for its own benefit or for the
benefit of other Eligible Purchasers) all aspects of this Agreement with
respect to all Orders placed under this Agreement. Quest Diagnostics shall be
responsible to **« Oxford Immunotec » **for the performance and non-
performance of any Eligible Purchasers under this Agreement. Further, all
Orders by Eligible Purchasers under this Agreement are subject to, and shall
comply in all respects with, the terms of the Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Pre-Existing Agreement_. If Quest Diagnostics or any of its
Affiliate acquires an entity that has a pre-existing agreement with **« Oxford
Immunotec » **or any of its Affiliates for the sale of Products by it to such
entity (" _Pre-Existing Agreement_ "), the acquired entity will become an
Eligible Purchaser on that date which is [***] immediately following **«
Oxford Immunotec »**'s receipt of a formal notice from Quest Diagnostics
stating that the entity shall become an Eligible Purchaser (" _Eligible
Purchaser Notice_ "). Quest Diagnostics may elect to terminate that Pre-
Existing Agreement by so stating in the Eligible Purchaser Notice. Any Pre-
Existing Agreement that Quest Diagnostics elects to terminate will terminate
as of that date which is [***] immediately following the date of **« Oxford
Immunotec »**'s receipt of the Eligible Purchaser Notice requesting the
termination of the Pre-Existing Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
orders for Products that are open as of the date an entity becomes an Eligible
Purchaser shall be fulfilled by **« Oxford Immunotec »** and paid for by the
applicable entity at the price set forth in the order. For the avoidance of
doubt, any minimum purchase commitments under any Pre-Existing Agreements
shall not be binding on Quest Diagnostics or its Affiliate.

  



  

1.4. _ No Minimum Purchases_

  



  

This Agreement is not a requirements contract nor does it guarantee any
minimum purchase by Quest Diagnostics or any other Eligible Purchaser, except
as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement. Failure to meet a specific
purchase amount will not result in any penalty or other obligation, financial
or otherwise, to Quest Diagnostics or any other Eligible Purchaser, except as
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

1.5. _ Certain Sale_ _s_ _Transactions_

  



  

(a) During the Contract Period, **« Oxford Immunotec » **and its
Affiliates shall not, directly or indirectly through resellers or otherwise,
sell Kits to the persons and entities set forth in Schedule 1.5(a), subject to
certain exceptions and [***] set forth in Schedule 1.5(a). This Section 1.5
and Schedule 1.5(a) apply only to **« Oxford Immunotec »**'s and its
Affiliates'' sales completed after the Effective Date and shall not affect
sales completed prior to that date or sales to customers listed on Schedule
1.5(b).

The Initial Contract Period starts on the Effective Date and ends at midnight

provided in this Agreement. The " _Contract Period_ " is the Initial Contract
Period and any extensions or renewals. The Agreement will automatically renew

 _Termination_

 \t\t\t \t\t 
---|---|--- 
    



  

(a) For Cause. Either Party may terminate this Agreement for cause. Cause
exists to terminate this Agreement if either Party defaults. A Party defaults
if it fails to meet or perform any material term, provision, agreement, or
obligation contained in this Agreement. If a Party breaches a term of this
Agreement and the non-defaulting Party decides to declare the breach a
default, the non-defaulting Party will give the defaulting Party written
notice of the default (" _Default Notice_ "). The defaulting Party has [***]
from the date of the Default Notice to cure the default (" _Cure Period_ ").
If, within the Cure Period, the defaulting Party does not cure the default,
the non-defaulting Party may seek any available legal or equitable remedy
available to it under Applicable Law. If, during the Cure Period, the
defaulting Party cures the default, this Agreement will remain in effect and
the Default Notice will be void. If the defaulting Party does not cure the
default but makes substantial progress towards curing the default, the non-
defaulting party may opt to void the Default Notice or exercise any of the
rights listed above.

  



  

(b) Insolvency. Either Party shall have the right, at its option, to
cancel and terminate this Agreement in the event that (i) the other Party
shall (a) become involved in insolvency, dissolution, bankruptcy or
receivership proceedings affecting the operation of its business, or (b) make
an assignment of all or substantially all of its assets for the benefit of
creditors; or (ii) a receiver or trustee is appointed for the other Party.

  



  

(c) Other. A Party may terminate this Agreement as provided elsewhere in
this Agreement.
