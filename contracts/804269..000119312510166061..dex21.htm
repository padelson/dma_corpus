ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Texas Business Organizations
Code (the " _TBOC_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company,
whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ") and a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent.

 



 

-1- Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
shall take place at the offices of Andrews Kurth in Dallas, Texas, at 9:00
a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by the parties (the " _Closing
Date_ "), which shall occur on the last Business Day (as hereinafter defined)
of the month during which the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
by applicable Law (as hereinafter defined)) of the conditions set forth in
Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions) has occurred, or at such other place, date and time as the Company
and Parent may agree in writing.

 

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Company shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by executing and filing a certificate of merger (the
" _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Texas
in accordance with Section 10.153 of the TBOC. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Texas and a certificate of filing of the
Certificate of Merger is issued by the Secretary of State of the State of
Texas, or at such later date or time as may be agreed by Parent and the
Company in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance
with the TBOC (such time as the Merger becomes effective is referred to herein
as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
the TBOC. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time all of the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

Section 1.5 _Certificate of Formation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation_.

 

(a) The articles of incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of formation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof and applicable Law, in each case consistent with the
obligations set forth in Section 5.9.

 

(b) The bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with the provisions thereof, hereof and applicable Law,
in each case consistent with the obligations set forth in Section 5.9.

 

Section 1.6 _Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, the directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of
the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation
or removal.

 



 

-2- Section 1.7 _Officers_. The officers of the Company (each vice president and
each other more senior officer) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their
earlier death, resignation or removal.

ARTICLE II

 

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the
holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Sections 2.1(b), 2.1(d)
and 2.1(e), each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(such shares, collectively, " _Company Common Stock_ ," and each, a " _Share_
"), other than any Cancelled Shares (as defined, and to the extent provided
in, Section 2.1(b)) and any Dissenting Shares (as defined, and to the extent
provided in, Section 2.1(e)), shall thereupon be converted automatically into
and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $24.50 in cash without any
interest thereon (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All Shares that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
this Section 2.1 shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and the holders of certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

(b)  _Company Held Shares_. Each Share that is held by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any such Shares held on
behalf of third parties or in a fiduciary capacity) (the " _Cancelled Shares_
") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and
retirement.

 

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing
the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent
the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which
they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

-3- (d) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company, or securities convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for shares of capital stock, shall occur, other than as
consented to by Parent under Section 5.1(b), as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or subdivision or combination, exchange, or any dividend or
distribution of stock, cash or property with a record date during such
period, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction,
the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change;
_provided_ that nothing herein shall be construed to permit the Company to
take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

(e) _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a shareholder
who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and
who is entitled to demand and properly demands the fair value of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
10.356 of the TBOC (the " _Dissenting Shareholders_ "), shall not be
converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ," and together with the Cancelled
Shares, the " _Excluded Shares_ "), but instead such holder shall be entitled
to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions
of Section 10.356 of the TBOC (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the rights provided for pursuant to the provisions of
Section 10.366 of the TBOC and this Section 2.1(e)), unless and until such
holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost rights to demand or receive the fair value of such shares of Company
Common Stock under the TBOC. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right,
such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if
they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive,
as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such share of
Company Common Stock, in accordance with Section 2.1(a), without any interest
thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
notices to exercise dissenters rights in respect of any shares of Company
Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such notices and any other instruments
served pursuant to the TBOC and received by the Company relating to
shareholders dissenters rights and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for fair value under the
TBOC. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to
settle, any such demand for payment. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.2 to pay for shares
of Company Common Stock for which dissenters rights have been perfected
shall be returned to Parent upon demand.



 

-4- Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or essentially simultaneously with the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or
trust company that shall be appointed by Parent and approved by the Company in
writing (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to act as a paying
agent hereunder (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of holders
of the Shares, the holders of Company Stock Options (as hereinafter defined)
entitled to receive Option Consideration, the holders of Company Stock Awards
(as hereinafter defined) entitled to receive Stock Award Consideration
and the holders of Company Warrants (as hereinafter defined) entitled to
receive Warrant Consideration cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay an amount
equal to the sum of (i) the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all
of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
the Excluded Shares), payable upon due surrender of the certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (" _Certificates_
") (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated
Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article II_ , plus (ii) the Option Consideration and the
Stock Award Consideration (as hereinafter defined) payable pursuant to
Section 5.5 plus (iii) the Warrant Consideration (as hereinafter defined)
payable pursuant to Section 5.15 (such cash referred to in subsections (a)(i),
(a)(ii) and (a)(iii) being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_
") and minus (iv) the Stock Purchase Plan Contributions (as hereinafter
defined). At or essentially simultaneously with the Effective Time, the
Company shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, cash
in U.S. dollars equal to the Stock Purchase Plan Contributions, which such
cash shall become part of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose except as provided in this Agreement.

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in any
event not later than the third Business Day following the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (x)
to each holder of record of Shares whose Shares were converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a letter of transmittal (which
shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof which are
reasonably acceptable to Parent) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company
shall reasonably determine) and (B) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration, (y) to
each holder of a Company Stock Option entitled to receive Option Consideration
or a Company Stock Award entitled to receive Stock Award Consideration, a
check in an amount due and payable to such holder pursuant to Section 5.5
hereof in respect of such Company Stock Option or Company Stock Award and (z)
to each holder of Company Warrants entitled to receive Warrant Consideration,
a check in the amount due and payable to such holder pursuant to Section 5.15
hereof in respect of such Company Warrant.

 

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required
by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check or, if requested in
writing by the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing
in excess of 4% of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, a wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by such holder, in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number
of Shares represented by such holders properly surrendered Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied
by (y) the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer or stock records of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon
due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes (as
hereinafter defined) have been paid or are not applicable.

 



 

-5- (iii) The Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this
Agreement to any holder of Shares, holder of Company Stock Options, holder of
Company Stock Awards or holder of Company Warrants such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any applicable provision of federal, state,
local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the
applicable Governmental Entity (as hereinafter defined), such withheld or
deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Shares, holder of the Company Stock Options,
holder of Company Stock Awards or holder of Company Warrants in respect of
which such deduction and withholding were made.

 

(c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged for a check or, if requested in writing
by the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing in excess
of 4% of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by such
holder, in the proper amount pursuant to and subject to the requirements of
this Article II.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of Shares for one year after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any
former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent
or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to former owners of Shares, Company Stock Options, Company Stock
Awards or Company Warrants pursuant to this Article II, Section 5.5 and
Section 5.15. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 2.2(d).

 



 

-6- (g) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond
in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the
number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
multiplied by the Merger Consideration.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as disclosed (i) in the Company SEC Documents filed or furnished on or
after June 30, 2008 and prior to the date of this Agreement (other than any
risk factor or forward-looking disclosure) for all representations and
warranties other than those in Sections 3.1(a) and 3.2(a), or (ii) in the
disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent immediately prior to
the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ," it
being understood and agreed that the lack of any specific reference to a
Company Disclosure Schedule in this Agreement shall not limit the
Companys right to qualify any representation or warranty in the Company
Disclosure Schedules), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub as follows:

 

Section 3.1 _Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc_.

 

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective
jurisdiction of organization. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has all
requisite corporate, partnership, limited liability company, trust or similar
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as presently conducted, except where the failure
to have such power or authority would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is qualified to do business and
is in good standing as a foreign corporation or other entity in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not,

reasonable access during normal business hours to the offices, properties,
books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) furnish to
Parent, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized

filing by the Company with the SEC containing such financial results), and
(iii) instruct the employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
authorized representatives (other than nonemployee directors) of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to cooperate reasonably with Parent to obtain access to
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.2, the Company
shall not be required to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to, grant access
or furnish information to Parent or any of its counsel, financial advisors,
auditors or other authorized representatives to the extent that such
information is subject to an attorney/client or attorney work product
privilege or that such access or the furnishing of such information is
prohibited by Law or an existing contract or agreement, _provided_ , that the

counsel, financial advisors, auditors or other representatives shall have
access to personnel records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating
to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other
information that in the Companys good faith opinion the disclosure of which

liability. Parent agrees that it will not, and will cause its counsel,
financial advisors, auditors or other representatives not to, use any
information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.2 for any purpose unrelated to
the Merger, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Such

the Company and its Subsidiaries. Parent shall present all requests for
information and access only to such persons as the parties may reasonably
agree upon.

(b) Parent hereby agrees that all information provided to it or its counsel,
financial advisors, auditors and other representatives in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall

Agreement, dated as of June 26, 2010, between the Company and Parent (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").



 

-34- Section 5.3 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Subject to and as otherwise provided in Sections 5.3(b)-(g), the Company
agrees that neither it nor any Subsidiary of the Company shall, and that it
shall direct and use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and other representatives, including
any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of
its Subsidiaries (" _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage (including by providing information) or
knowingly facilitate any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, or
the making or completion of, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or
participate in any negotiations concerning, or provide or cause to be provided
any non-public information or data relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in connection with, or have any discussions with any person
relating to, an actual or proposed Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or
implement an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement
relating to any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) amend, terminate, waive or
knowingly fail to enforce, or grant any consent under, any confidentiality,
standstill or similar agreement entered into during the twelve (12) months
prior to the date of this Agreement in respect of an Acquisition Proposal, or
(v) resolve to propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Without limiting
the foregoing, it is understood that any action taken in violation of this
Section 5.3 by any Subsidiary of the Company or Representatives of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 5.3 by the Company.

 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, immediately cease any existing solicitations, discussions
or negotiations with any Person (other than the parties hereto) that has made
or indicated an intention to make or finance an Acquisition Proposal. The
Company, if it has not already done so, shall promptly request that each
Person, if any, that has executed a confidentiality agreement within the
12-month period prior to the date hereof in connection with its consideration
of any Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (and all analyses and other materials prepared by or on
behalf of such Person to the extent that such analyses and materials contain,
reflect or analyze such confidential information). 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company may, in response to
an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal which did not result from or arise in
connection with a breach of Section 5.3(a) or (b) and which the Board (or the
Special Committee, as the case may be) determines, in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors of national
reputation, is, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior
Proposal, (i) furnish information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its
Representatives pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement with terms
not materially less restrictive of the other party than the Confidentiality
Agreement, and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with such
Person and its Representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_
, _however_ , (x) that Parent shall be entitled to receive an executed copy of
such confidentiality agreement (for informational purposes only) prior to or
substantially simultaneously with the Company furnishing information to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal or its Representatives and (y) that
the Company shall simultaneously provide or make available to Parent any
material non-public information concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is provided to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
or its Representatives which was not previously provided or made available
to Parent. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that an Acquisition
Proposal received subsequent to the date of this Agreement, from a Person or
Persons that the Company was engaged in discussions with prior to the date of
this Agreement, shall be deemed to be "unsolicited" as long as the Company
has not breached its obligations under Section 5.3(a) or (b).



 

-35- (d) Subject to and as otherwise provided in Section 7.1(c)(ii) and
this Section 5.3(d), neither the Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or resolve to
or publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub, the Recommendation, (ii) approve or publicly propose to approve
any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement or similar agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal or (iii)
approve or recommend, resolve to or publicly propose to approve, endorse or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing actions in clauses
(i) through (iii), whether taken by the Board or a committee thereof, a "
_Change in Board Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided
that the Company has not breached its obligations under Section 5.4(b), if,
prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, (i) the Board (or the
Special Committee, as the case may be) consults with financial advisors of
national reputation and determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside counsel, that the failure to withdraw or modify its Recommendation
would be inconsistent with the Boards fiduciary duties to the shareholders
of the Company, (ii) (x) the Board (or the Special Committee, as the case may
be) has notified Parent in writing of the determination described in clause
(i) and, if such determination is not in response to an Acquisition Proposal,
such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the material events giving rise
thereto, and (y) at least five (5) days following receipt by Parent of the
notice referred to in clause (x) above (provided that, if such determination
described in clause (i) above is made within twelve (12) days prior to the
Company Meeting, then such five (5) day period shall instead be one (1)
Business Day), and taking into account any proposed adjustments made by
Parent since receipt of the notice referred to in clause (x) above, the Board
maintains its determination described in clause (i) above, provided that
during such five (5) day or one (1) Business Day period, as the case may be,
after receipt by Parent of such notice, the Company has, if requested by
Parent, negotiated in good faith with, and caused the Companys
Representatives to negotiate in good faith with, Parent to attempt to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable
the Board (or Special Committee, as the case may be) to proceed with the
transactions contemplated herein, without having to make a Change in
Board Recommendation, and (iii) if the Change in Board Recommendation is
based on the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal did
not result from a breach of Section 5.3(a) or (b) and the Board, the Special
Committee and the Company shall have first complied with their obligations
set forth in Section 7.1(c)(ii)(B) and (C), then the Board (or the Special
Committee, as the case may be) may effect a Change in Board Recommendation.

 



 

-36- (e) The Company promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) shall advise
Parent orally and in writing of (i) the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company or its
Subsidiaries which, in the good faith judgment of the Board (or the Special
Committee, as the case may be) is or could reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) the identity of the Person making any such
Acquisition Proposal, and (iv) the material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal or request (including copies of any material document or other
written communication evidencing such Acquisition Proposal or request). The
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis of any
material change to the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal. 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than in connection with a termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) with respect to a Superior
Proposal, the Company shall not waive Section 21.606 of the TBOC with respect
to any Person other than Parent, its shareholders and their respective
Affiliates, unless the Company has otherwise complied with its obligations
under this Section 5.3 and the Board (or the Special Committee, as the case
may be) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel,
that the failure to grant any such waiver would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Board from (i) disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any other
disclosure to the Companys shareholders if, with respect to this clause
(ii), the Company shall have, to the extent reasonably practicable, provided
Parent with a reasonable opportunity in advance to comment on and review any
such disclosure and, in the case of any disclosure described in this clause
(ii), the Board (or the Special Committee, as the case may be) determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that either (A)
failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Companys shareholders or (B) such disclosure is required by
applicable Law or by the rules of any applicable national securities exchange;
_provided_ that nothing herein shall relieve the Company of its obligations
under Section 5.3(d) unless compliance with such obligations would result in
a violation of Law.

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any
proposal or offer (i) from any Person or group of Persons other than Parent or
one of its Subsidiaries for a merger, consolidation, dissolution,
recapitalization or other business combination involving the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, (ii) involving the issuance by the Company of over 20% of
its equity securities or (iii) to acquire in any manner, directly or
indirectly, over 20% of the equity securities or consolidated total assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case other than the Merger.



 

-37- (i) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal (i) on terms which the Board (or the
Special Committee, as the case may be) determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors
of national reputation, to be more favorable from a financial point of view
to the holders (excluding consideration of any interests that any holder may
have other than as a shareholder of the Company entitled to receive the merger
consideration) of Company Common Stock than the Merger, taking into account
all the terms and conditions of such proposal (including the expected timing
and likelihood of consummation), and the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (including any proposal or offer by Parent to amend the terms of
this Agreement and the Merger during the applicable time periods specified in
Section 7.1(c)(ii), and (ii) that the Board (or the Special Committee, as the
case may be) believes is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into
account financing commitments and all financial, regulatory, legal and other
aspects of such proposal; _provided_ that for purposes of the definition of
"Superior Proposal," the references to "20%" in the definition
of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

Section 5.4 _Filings; Other Actions_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare the Proxy Statement, which shall,
subject to Section 5.3(d), include the Recommendation. Parent and the Company
shall cooperate with each other in connection with the preparation of the
foregoing document. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to have
the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable after such
filing. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Companys shareholders as promptly
as practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC. The Company

supplement thereto) and each Company SEC Document to be filed after the date
of this Agreement, and all responses to requests for additional information
by and replies to comments of the SEC, prior to filing such with the SEC, and
Parent and the Company will provide each other with copies of all such filings
made and correspondence with the SEC with respect thereto. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time, any information should be discovered by any party
hereto which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed by the Company with the SEC and
disseminated by the Company to the shareholders of the Company.



 

-38- (b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall (i)
take all action necessary in accordance with the TBOC and its articles of
incorporation and bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following

Shareholder Approval (such meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof,
the " _Company Meeting_ "), and (ii) subject to the Boards (or the Special
Committees, as the case may be) withdrawal or modification of its
Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.3(d), use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of the approval of
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 7.1 and subject to
compliance with Section 7.2, if applicable, the Company, regardless of
whether the Board (or the Special Committee, as the case may be) has approved,
endorsed or recommended an Acquisition Proposal or has withdrawn or modified
the Recommendation, will submit this Agreement for approval by the
shareholders of the Company at such meeting.

(a) _Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

 

(i) Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Company and Parent and the
applicable holder thereof, each option or other award to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock, other than stock options outstanding as of the date of
this Agreement pursuant to the Stock Purchase Plan (each, a " _Company Stock
Option_ "), granted under any plans or arrangements of the Company providing
for compensation payable in or based on Company Common Stock (the " _Company
Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding or that is
required to be treated as outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall (notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in the Company Stock
Plans or applicable option grants), as of the Effective Time, become fully
vested and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash in U.S.
dollars equal to (1) (A) the product of (x) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option and (y) the excess,
if any, of the amount of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option (or if
there is not any such excess, zero) with the aggregate amount of such payment
rounded to the nearest cent (the aggregate amount of such cash
hereinafter referred to as the " _Option Consideration_ ") or, if less, (B)
the amount to which the holder of such Company Stock Option would otherwise be
entitled under the terms of the applicable option grant and the applicable
Company Stock Plan, less (2) such amounts as are required to be withheld or
deducted under the Code or any provision of federal, state, local or foreign
Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment.

 

(ii) Subject to any and all applicable performance criteria being satisfied
and, except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Company and Parent and the
applicable holder thereof, each award, other than a Company Stock Option,
granted under a Company Stock Plan and providing for compensation payable in
or based on Company Common Stock, or the value thereof (each, a " _Company
Stock Award_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding or that is
required to be treated as outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall (notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in the Company Stock
Plans or applicable award agreements), as of the Effective Time, become fully
vested and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash in U.S.
dollars equal to (1) (A) the amount of cash or the value of the Company
Common Stock, as applicable, net of any exercise price, base amount or other
offset provided in the award agreement with respect to such Company Stock
Award, that would otherwise be payable or deliverable upon the exercise of the
Company Stock Award (as if it were vested) at the Effective Time and based on
the amount of the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock
subject to or underlying such Company Stock Award (or if the net amount is not
more than zero) with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded to the
nearest cent (the aggregate amount of such cash hereinafter referred to as the
" _Stock Award Consideration_ "), or, if less, (B) the amount to which the
holder of such Company Stock Award would otherwise be entitled under the
terms of the applicable award agreement and the applicable Company Stock Plan,
less (2) such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the
Code or any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law with
respect to the making of such payment.



 

-39- (iii) At the Effective Time, the Stock Purchase Plan shall
terminate. Additionally, at or prior to the Effective Time, the offering
period in effect under the Stock Purchase Plan at the Effective Time shall
end, and all options in effect, for which the Stock Purchase Plan
Contributions have been made, for such offering period shall automatically be
exercised for the applicable exercise price under the terms of the Stock
Purchase Plan. The Company Common Stock purchased upon such automatic exercise
shall, unless otherwise purchased by the Parent or the Company, be deemed to
be outstanding and owned, unless otherwise sold or transferred, by the
applicable Stock Purchase Plan participants at the Effective Time. After the
date hereof, no employee who is not a participant in the Stock Purchase
Plan may become a participant in the Stock Purchase Plan, no participant in
the Stock Purchase Plan may increase the percentage amount of his or her
payroll deduction election from those in effect on the date hereof, and no
further offering period shall commence.

(iv) Prior to the Effective Time, with reasonable advance notice and prior
consultation with Parent, the Compensation Committee of the Board or the
Board, as appropriate, shall make such adjustments and amendments to, make
such determinations or take such actions with respect to existing Company
Stock Plans, the Stock Purchase Plan, Company Stock Awards, Company Stock
Options and Company Benefit Plans, including giving notices and obtaining
consents where necessary, to effect the settlement and/or cancellation
immediately prior to the Effective Time of all Company Stock Options,
options under the Stock Purchase Plan and Company Stock Awards outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, in each case in accordance with their
respective terms as in effect on the date of this Agreement, and to implement
the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.5. Payments to be made pursuant to
this Section 5.5 shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, and the Company agrees to provide to Parent as soon as
reasonably practicable prior to the Effective Time such supporting records
with respect to such payments as may be reasonably requested by Parent. In no
event shall any provision of this Section 5.5 result in the vesting or payment
of any grant, award or shares that lapse or are otherwise forfeited prior to
the Effective Time in accordance with their respective terms as in effect on
the date of this Agreement. Except as otherwise agreed to in writing by the
Company and the Parent, there shall be no Company Stock Options, awards of
Restricted Stock, Company Stock Awards or options under the Stock Purchase
Plan outstanding after the Effective Time.

 

(b) _Employees and Employee Benefit Plans_. Following the Closing:

 

(i) _Employment_. As of the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Company to
continue to employ each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ("
_Employees_ ") (including any Employees on authorized leave), with such
employment to be, for a period of at least one year following the Closing
Date, at not less than the same base pay and bonus and incentive compensation
opportunity level as in effect on the date of this Agreement. Subject to
Section 5.5(c), nothing in this provision precludes the Company from
terminating an Employee for due cause or in the ordinary course of
business for any other purpose required by business conditions or
developments.



 

-40- (ii) _Employee Benefits_. Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, offer
employee benefits to the Employees that are, and shall be on terms and
conditions that are, for at least one year following the Closing Date, no less
favorable in the aggregate to the Employees than those provided by the Company
Benefit Plans as in effect on the date of this Agreement. With the exception
of the severance benefits provided for in Section 5.5(c), nothing herein shall
be deemed to obligate Parent or the Company to adopt or maintain any
particular employee benefit plan (including any equity compensation plans or
arrangements), and nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the ability of the
Parent or the Company to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan at any
time after the Closing Date.

 

(iii) _Credit for Prior Service_. Parent agrees that from and after the
Closing, the Employees shall be credited with their length of service with
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility and
vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accrual) under all employee benefit
plans, programs and policies of Parent or any Affiliate of Parent (" _Parent
Benefit Plans_ ") in which the Employees may be covered, to the same extent
that service provided prior to the Closing Date by employees of Parent or any
Affiliate of Parent is recognized under the relevant Parent Benefit Plan.
Such pre-Closing service credit shall also be taken into account for purposes
of benefit computation under all vacation, sick leave, paid time off, and
severance plans or policies that may apply to the Employees after the Closing
Date. In addition, Parent shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
continue to recognize all vacation time, sick leave, paid time off, or other
leave accrued by each Employee as of the Closing Date.

 

(iv) _Terms of Coverage_. To the extent Employees become covered under any
Parent Benefit Plan, any restriction on coverage for pre-existing conditions
or requirement for evidence of insurability under such plans shall be waived
for the Employees to the extent any such limitations had already been
satisfied under the Company Benefit Plans. Parent shall, or shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
any third party to waive such pre-existing restriction or insurability
requirement under the Parent Benefit Plans. Parent shall ensure that each
Employee who becomes covered under any Parent Benefit Plan that is a group
health plan (including a "group health plan" as defined in Section 5000(b)(1)
of the Code or a group health plan applicable to Employees in jurisdictions
outside of the United States) shall receive credit for those sums paid in the
current year under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan as deductibles,
coinsurance and copayments, towards any deductible and/or out-of-pocket
maximum which may apply under such Parent Benefit Plan.

(c) _Severance_. If, during the twelve (12) months following the Closing Date,
the Company, Parent or an Affiliate of any of them terminates the employment
of any Person who was an Employee on the Closing Date, without cause (as
reasonably determined by the Company, the Parent or such Affiliate), then the
Parent, Company or such Affiliate shall pay to such Person severance benefits
in an amount not less than the amount to which such Person would have been
entitled under the severance policy of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in effect on the date of this Agreement or, in the case of any Canadian
Employee, not less than the amount to which such Person would have been
entitled under applicable Law.



 

-41- Section 5.6 _Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its
reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in accordance with, applicable Law)
to take promptly, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or
to cause to be done, and to assist and to cooperate with the other parties
in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including
(i) the obtaining of all necessary waivers, consents and approvals, including
the Company Approvals and the Parent Approvals, from Governmental Entities
and the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of
all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to
avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity and (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties
other than Governmental Entities. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company
otherwise uses its reasonable best efforts in accordance with this Section
5.6(a), then obtaining the items in clauses (i) and (ii) shall not constitute,
or be construed to constitute, conditions to closing under this Agreement
except as specifically contemplated by Sections 6.1(c) and 6.3(e), and the
failure to obtain any of the items in clauses (i) and (ii) shall not
constitute a breach of this Agreement by the Company, and (iii) the defending
of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (i) promptly as practicable after
the date hereof, make their respective filings and thereafter make any other
required submissions under the HSR Act, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with each other in (x) determining whether any filings are required
to be made with, or consents, permits, authorizations, waivers or approvals
are required to be obtained from, any third parties or other Governmental
Entities in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) timely making
all such filings and timely seeking all such consents, permits,
authorizations or approvals, (iii) use reasonable best efforts to take, or to
cause to be taken, all other actions and to do, or to cause to be done, all
other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including taking
all such further action as reasonably may be necessary to resolve such
objections, if any, as the United States Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, state or
foreign antitrust enforcement authorities or competition authorities, other
Governmental Entities in connection with the HSR Act and foreign competition
approvals, or other state or federal regulatory authorities of any other
nation or other jurisdiction or any other person may assert under Regulatory
Law (as hereinafter defined) with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the End Date (as
hereinafter defined)), and (iv) subject to applicable legal limitations and
the instructions of any Governmental Entity, use reasonable best efforts to
keep each other apprised of the status of matters, including to the extent
permitted by Law promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or
other communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or
any of their Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
related to the approval of the Merger, allowing each other to review in
advance any filing or written materials submitted to any Governmental Entity
related to the approval of the Merger, and providing the other party and its
counsel with advance notice of and, to the extent permitted by Law,
the opportunity to participate in any discussion, telephone call or meeting
with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or other
inquiry related to the approval of the Merger.

 



 

-42- (c) Subject to Section 5.10, and in furtherance and not in limitation of the
covenants of the parties contained in this Section 5.6, if any administrative
or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party,
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and
Parent shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 5.6 shall limit a partys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) or so long as such party has,
prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under this Section
5.6.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ " means any and all
Laws requiring notice to, filings with, or the consent or approval of, any
Governmental Entity, or that otherwise may cause any restriction, in
connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including (i) the Sherman Act of 1890, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, the
HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 and all other Laws that are
designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening
competition through merger or acquisition, (ii) any Law governing the direct
or indirect ownership or control of any of the operations or assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or (iii) any Law with the purpose of protecting
the national security of any nation.

Section 5.7  _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or other form of anti-takeover statute or regulation shall
become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent and the members of their
respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are reasonably necessary so that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to a Change in Board
Recommendation, the Company and Parent will consult with and provide each
other the opportunity to review and comment upon any press release or other
public statement prior to the issuance of such press release or other public
statement relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein
(other than routine employee communications) and shall not issue any such
press release or other public statement prior to such consultation except as
such party in its good faith judgment may be required by applicable Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange, it being understood that the final form of any release or statement
shall be at the final discretion of the issuing party. Parent and the Company
agree to issue a joint press release announcing the execution and delivery of
this Agreement.



 

-43- Section 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification (including rights accruing under self-insurance arrangements
in respect of deductibles, coverage limits or forgone third-party insurance)
and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, now existing in favor of the current or former directors,
officers or employees (in their capacity as such or when serving at the
request or for the benefit of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as a director,
officer, partner, employee, agent or fiduciary of any other partnership,
joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other entity or enterprise), as
the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in any
agreement (copies of which have been provided to Parent and are listed in
Section 5.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule) or in the articles of
incorporation or bylaws or other organization documents of the Company or its
Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect. For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses and arrangement of self-insurance
provisions of the Companys and any of its Subsidiaries articles of
incorporation and bylaws or similar organization documents in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements
of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective current or
former directors, officers or employees in effect as of the date hereof with
respect to actions or omissions taken at or prior to the Effective Time, and
shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any
Action (as hereinafter defined) pending or asserted or any claim made
within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or
resolution of such claim.



 

-44- (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, jointly and
severally indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of
the foregoing) each current and former director and officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such persons heirs, executors
or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including advancing reasonable attorneys fees, costs and expenses in advance
of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to
each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an "
_Action_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission of the Indemnified Party occurring or alleged to have occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time and with respect to current and former directors
occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before or after the Effective
Time, in connection with such persons serving as an officer, director or
other fiduciary of the Company or any other entity if such service was at the
request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the
same extent as provided in the Companys and any of its
Subsidiaries articles of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational
documents in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any
indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries in effect as of
the date hereof; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without
either Parents or the Surviving Corporations prior written consent, and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of
more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified
Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any
single such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation; provided,
further, however, that if any Indemnified Party or group of Indemnified
Parties is advised in writing by counsel that a conflict of interest is likely
to exist if the same counsel were to represent such Indemnified Party
or group of Indemnified Parties and another Indemnified Party or group of
Indemnified Parties, then the Surviving Corporation shall pay the fees and
expenses of the minimum number of counsel as are required to eliminate such
conflicts of interest. It shall be a condition to the advancement of any
amounts to be paid in respect of legal and other fees, costs and expenses that
the Surviving Corporation receive an undertaking by the Indemnified Party to
repay such legal and other fees, costs and expenses paid in advance if it is
finally judicially determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
be indemnified under applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein, the Surviving Corporation shall not amend its bylaws or articles of
incorporation as of or after the Effective Time if such action would adversely
affect the rights of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were
entitled to advances, indemnification, contribution or exculpation
thereunder for actions or omissions by such individuals in their capacity as
directors or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at any time
prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall either
(i) cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries or (ii) cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide substitute policies or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase a
"tail policy," in either case of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous in the
aggregate than such existing policies with respect to matters arising on or
before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Effective
Time, such Persons shall not be required to pay with respect to such insurance
policies in respect of any one policy year more than 300% of the last
annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the
coverages required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall
purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount; and
further _provided_ that if the Surviving Corporation purchases a "tail
policy" and the same coverage costs more than 300% of such last annual
premium, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase the maximum amount of
coverage that can be obtained for 300% of such last annual premium.



 

-45- (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of or exclusive of, any other rights such Indemnified
Party may have under the articles of incorporation or bylaws or other
organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, self-insurance
arrangement, the TBOC or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.9 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit,
and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. Nothing in this
Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or
impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any
policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective current or former officers, directors and
employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided
for in this Section 5.9 is not prior to or in substitution for any such
claims under any such policies.

obligations provided in this Section 5.9, _provided_ that any Indemnified
Party shall first be obligated to provide ten (10) days advance written
notice to Parent before bringing any such claim except if failure to so
provide such notice would result in the expiration of any statute
of limitations regarding such claim, no such notice shall be required.

Section 5.10 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement,
in, but not control, the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation
against the Company and/or its directors relating to the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated hereby and no such settlement shall in any event be
agreed to without Parents prior consent, which may not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby or from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may
be required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such communication or the
failure of such party to obtain such consent could reasonably be expected to
be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) any
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such
partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or

circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event
the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would could reasonably be expected
to cause or result in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article
VI not being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions being materially
delayed in violation of any provision of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.11
shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision
of this Agreement or (y) limit the remedies available to the party receiving
such notice. The Company shall notify Parent, on a reasonably current basis,
of any events or changes of which the Company is aware with respect to any
criminal or regulatory investigation or action involving the Company or any
of its Affiliates (but excluding traffic violations and similar misdemeanors),
and shall reasonably cooperate with Parent in efforts to mitigate any adverse
consequences to Parent which may arise therefrom (including by coordinating
and providing assistance in meeting with regulators).

Section 5.12 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-
Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such
matters. 

Section 5.13 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree
that (i) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys operations prior to
the Effective Time, and (ii) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its operations.

Notes, (iv) warrants sold to JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank on September 12, 2006

Warrant, the " _Company Warrants_ "), and (v) hedge transactions entered into
with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, London Branch (" _JPMorgan_ "
and such hedge transaction, the " _JPMorgan Hedge Transaction_ ") and Deutsche
Bank AG, London Branch (" _Deutsche Bank_ " and such hedge transaction, the "

Convertible Senior Notes and the Hedged Warrants, in each case as directed by
and in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in writing by
Parent, and the Company shall consult with Parent before taking any action
with respect to any of the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall not be obligated under this Section
5.14(a) to take any action that (A) is not conditioned upon the occurrence of
the Effective Time, (B) except as otherwise provided in the following
sentence, could potentially expose the Company to material liability or
expense or (C) could result in any representation or warranty of the Company
in this Agreement being or becoming untrue or incorrect or that could result
in the Company being in breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to September 30, 2010, the Company shall
enter into binding agreements, in form and substance satisfactory to Parent,
with JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank to settle the JPMorgan Hedge Transaction and
the Deutsche Bank Hedge Transaction, respectively, using the Cancellation and
Payment (Calculation Agent Determination) methodology, which, for the
avoidance of doubt, is the methodology used to calculate the unwind value of
the hedges with respect to the Hedged Warrants upon the occurrence of
a merger event. All actions, notices, announcements and other documentation
related to the foregoing shall be subject to the prior written approval of
Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The
Parent shall cooperate reasonably with the Company in connection with the
Companys performance of its obligations under this Section 5.14(a). Parent
and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that, except for settlement of the
JPMorgan Hedge Transaction and the Deutsche Bank Hedge Transaction, obtaining
any particular outcome with respect to any of the actions requested by the
Parent to be taken pursuant to this Section 5.14(a) shall not constitute, or
be construed to constitute, a condition to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the failure to obtain any
particular outcome shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement by the
Company.

 

(b) Other than with respect to the Convertible Senior Notes, which are covered
by Section 5.14(a), the Company shall promptly take such actions as are
reasonably requested in writing by Parent under any debt agreements, including
the Secured Debt; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall not be obligated under this Section 5.14(b) to take any
action that (i) is not conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time,
(ii) could potentially expose the Company to material liability or expense,
(iii) could result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation, payment for any consent or
similar fee, or the loss of any benefit under any debt agreements, including
the Secured Debt, or (iv) could result in any representation or warranty of
the Company in this Agreement being or becoming untrue or incorrect or that
could result in the Company being in breach of any of its obligations under
this Agreement. All actions, notices, announcements and other documentation
related to the foregoing shall be subject to the prior written approval of
Parent. For purposes of this paragraph, " _Secured Debt_ " means any
Securitization Transactions and any secured debt (including any Warehouse
Transactions) outstanding or committed. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and
agree that obtaining any particular outcome with respect to any of the actions
requested by the Parent to be taken pursuant to this Section 5.14(b) shall
not constitute, or be construed to constitute, a condition to the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the failure to obtain
any particular outcome shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement by the
Company.



 

-48- Section 5.15 _Warrants_. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Company
and Parent and the applicable holder thereof, each Wachovia Warrant and each
Deutsche Warrant that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time

an amount in cash in U.S. dollars equal to the product of (a) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Wachovia Warrant or
Deutsche Warrant, as the case may be, and (b) the Merger Consideration, upon
payment to the Company of the exercise price per share of Company Stock
subject to such Wachovia Warrant or Deutsche Warrant, as the case may be, or
if the holders of the Wachovia Warrant or Deutsche Warrant, as the case may
be, elect to be paid in full or in part on a "cashless basis," as permitted
therein, the Wachovia Warrant or Deutsche Warrant, as the case may be, shall
become exercisable on a "cashless basis" into the right to receive an amount
in cash in U.S. dollars equal to the product of (i) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Wachovia Warrant or Deutsche
Warrant, as the case may be, and (ii) the excess, if any, of the amount of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Wachovia Warrant or Deutsche Warrant, as the case may
be, with the aggregate of such payment rounded to the nearest cent (the
aggregate amount of cash issuable upon payment of the applicable exercise
price, net of the exercise price, or the aggregate amount of cash issuable
upon a exercise on a "cashless basis," is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Warrant Consideration_ "), in each case less such amounts, if any as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of
federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such
payment. The Parent will deposit the Warrant Consideration with the Paying
Agent as provided in Section 2.2 hereof in furtherance thereof.
