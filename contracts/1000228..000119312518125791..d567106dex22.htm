be canceled in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)(ii)_ hereof) shall be
automatically converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration. Following the Effective Time, all shares of Voyager Capital
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
cease to exist, and each certificate previously evidencing any such shares of
Voyager Capital Stock (a " _Voyager Certificate_ ") shall thereafter cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon the
surrender of such Voyager

 



22  Certificates in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_, the Per Share
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.

 

(ii) All shares of Voyager Capital Stock held in Spincos or Merger Subs
treasury or owned by any other Spinco Entity, Harbor Entity or Voyager or any
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Voyager shall be cancelled and extinguished and
shall cease to exist and no shares of Spinco Common Stock or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, in the event that the Series Preferred Issue Price (as defined
in the Voyager Certificate of Incorporation) of any share of Voyager Preferred
Stock, plus any dividends declared but unpaid thereon, is greater than the
Closing Per Share Merger Consideration, the provisions of this Agreement
allocating the Closing Per Share Merger Consideration among the Voyager
Stockholders shall be deemed to be amended and restated, and the Parties shall
cooperate to document such amendment and restatement, to give effect to the
applicable provisions of the Voyager Certificate of Incorporation; _provided_
, that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)(iii) _shall either prejudice in
any way the rights and remedies of Harbor and Spinco under this Agreement or
permit the Parties to take any action (or fail to take any action) that is
inconsistent with the Spin-off Tax Opinion or Merger Tax Opinion, or otherwise
could reasonably be expected to result in a Tax-Free Transaction Failure.

 

(iv) Any fractional shares of Spinco Common Stock that would otherwise be
issuable to a Voyager Stockholder pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)(i)_
shall be aggregated and such Voyager Stockholder shall be issued in respect of
all such fractional shares a number of shares of Spinco Common Stock equal to
such aggregate number, rounded to the nearest whole number. Harbor, Spinco,
Merger Sub, Voyager and the Voyager Stockholders Representative acknowledge
and agree that the conversion set forth in the preceding sentence in lieu of
issuing fractional shares of Spinco Common Stock was not separately
bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off
for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Spinco that would
otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares of Spinco Common
Stock. In the event that after giving effect to this _Section_ __ _
2.7(b)(iv)_, the aggregate number of shares of Spinco Common Stock issued to
the Voyager Stockholders is greater than the number of shares of Spinco
Common Stock to be issued as the Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration, the
Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration shall be deemed to be amended to
include such number of additional shares of Spinco Common Stock issued
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)(iv)_.

Section 2.8 _Exchange of Shares_ _._

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Spinco shall designate
a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Voyager to act as the
exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for
purposes of exchanging shares of Voyager Capital Stock in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. At or prior to the Effective Time, Spinco shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, evidence of
Spinco Common Stock in book-entry form representing the aggregate Closing Per
Share Merger Consideration issuable to holders of Voyager Capital Stock as of
the Effective Time pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_ (such evidence of book-
entry shares of Spinco Common Stock, together with any such cash amounts
subsequently deposited after Closing in respect of the Adjustment Amount
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(d)_, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in
this Agreement.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Prior to the Effective Time, Spinco shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Voyager Capital
Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (together with any other materials delivered
therewith, the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Voyager
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the

 



23  Voyager Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange
Agent and shall be in such form as agreed to by Spinco and Voyager and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of Voyager Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for payment of the Closing Per
Share Merger Consideration into which such Voyager Capital Stock has been
converted pursuant to this Agreement. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Spinco shall cause the Exchange Agent to distribute to each Voyager
Stockholder that delivers to the Exchange Agent, together with such Voyager
Stockholders Voyager Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof),
a Letter of Transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, the number of shares of Spinco Common Stock (in
uncertificated form or evidence of shares in book-entry form) into which the
shares of Voyager Capital Stock held by such Voyager Stockholder as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time have been converted in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_ hereof and, promptly following the final
determination of the Final Closing Statement in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.1(c)_, any amount payable in respect of the Additional Per Share Merger
Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Exchange
Agent have the right to vote any shares of Spinco Common Stock held by the
Exchange Agent.

 

(c) _No Further Rights in Voyager Capital Stock_. All shares of Spinco
Common Stock issued upon conversion of shares of Voyager Capital Stock in
accordance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 2.8(c) _shall be deemed to
have been issued at the Effective Time in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Voyager Capital Stock. At the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of Voyager shall be closed and thereafter there shall
be no further registration of transfers of shares of Voyager Capital Stock on
the records of Voyager. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
shares of Voyager Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Voyager
Capital Stock except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the former holders of shares of Voyager Capital
Stock on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Spinco, upon demand, and any former holders of shares of Voyager
Capital Stock who have not theretofore received shares of Spinco Common Stock
in accordance with this _Article_ __ _ II_ shall thereafter look only to
Spinco for the Per Share Merger Consideration (subject to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law).

 

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Parties hereto or the Exchange Agent shall
be liable to any Person for any Per Share Merger Consideration or other
amounts from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Voyager Capital Stock as of a
date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Spinco free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Voyager
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Voyager
Certificate to be lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed and, if required by
Spinco, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such
terms as may be required by Spinco as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it, the Exchange Agent or Spinco with respect to such
Voyager Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen, mutilated or destroyed Voyager Certificate the shares of Spinco Common
Stock and the cash that would have been issuable or payable pursuant to the
provisions of this  _Article II_ (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.8(g)_) had such lost, stolen or
destroyed Voyager Certificate been surrendered.

 



24 (g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Harbor, Spinco, the
Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent hereto, as the case may be,
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax authority,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Persons with respect to which such deduction and
withholding was made.

 

(h) _Uncertificated Shares_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Spinco
shall cause the Exchange Agent to (i) mail to each holder of uncertificated
shares of Voyager Capital Stock materials advising such holder of the
effectiveness of the Merger and the conversion of its shares of Voyager
Capital Stock into the Per Share Merger Consideration and (ii) issue to each
holder of that number of whole shares of Spinco Common Stock that such holder
is entitled to receive in respect of each such uncertificated share of Voyager
Capital Stock pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_ in uncertificated form (or
evidence of shares in book-entry form, as applicable, in respect of each such
uncertificated share of Voyager Capital Stock (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.8(g)_), without interest
thereon.

 

Section 2.9 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Voyager Capital Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a Voyager Stockholder who
is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such shares of
Voyager Capital Stock in accordance with, and who complies in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration,
and shall instead represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such Voyager Stockholder fails to perfect or
otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262
of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then the right of such Voyager
Stockholder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease
and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the
Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable solely for the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to
any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.8(g)_. Voyager shall give Harbor and Spinco prompt notice
of any demands received by Voyager for appraisal of shares of Voyager Capital
Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by Voyager relating to rights to be paid
the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Harbor and Spinco shall have the
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, Voyager shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Harbor and Spinco, make any payment (unless required
by Law) with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or
compromise, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands,
or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 2.10 _Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, Spinco, Merger Sub
and Voyager shall take all such action as may be necessary to cause such
individuals as may be mutually agreed by the Parties to be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time, to hold office
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their
earlier death, resignation or removal.

 

Section 2.11 _Officers_. Subject to applicable Law, Spinco, Merger Sub and
Voyager shall take all such action as may be necessary to cause such
individuals as may be mutually agreed by the Parties to be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time, to hold office until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier
death, resignation or removal.

 



25 Section 2.12 _Escrowed Shares_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Harbor,
Spinco and the Voyager Stockholders Representative shall enter into an escrow
agreement to be agreed upon in good faith between the Parties (the " _Escrow
Agreement_ ") with an escrow agent selected by Harbor and reasonably
acceptable to the Voyager Stockholders Representative (the " _Escrow Agent_
"). On or prior to the Closing Date, the Escrowed Shares shall be deposited by
Spinco in an escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") and such Escrowed
Shares shall be held in escrow pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement and distributed in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_.
Distributions of any Escrowed Shares from the Escrow Account, the number of
such Escrowed Shares deposited with the Escrow Agent, and the valuation of
such Escrowed Shares for purposes of redemption pursuant to this Agreement
shall be determined in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. The adoption of
this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the Voyager Stockholders
shall constitute approval of the Escrow Agreement and the arrangements
relating thereto, including, without limitation, the deposit of the Escrowed
Shares in the Escrow Account.

Article III

 

POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS

 

Section 3.1 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) Within ninety (90) days following the Distribution Date, Spinco shall
cause to be prepared and delivered to the Voyager Stockholders
Representative a certificate endorsed by an executive officer of Spinco
certifying a statement (the " _Preliminary Closing Statement_ ") setting forth
Spincos good faith calculation of (i) the Voyager Transaction Expenses
Amount, (ii) the Voyager Working Capital Adjustment, (iii) the Voyager Net
Debt Adjustment, and (iv) the Adjustment Amount, including reasonable detail
regarding the calculations thereof. The Preliminary Closing Statement shall
be prepared in accordance with the Applicable Accounting Principles.

(b) During the forty-five (45)-day period following the Voyager
Stockholders Representatives receipt of the Preliminary Closing Statement,
Spinco shall give the Voyager Stockholders Representative and each of its
Representatives access at all reasonable times and on reasonable advance
notice to the books, records, properties, working papers and personnel of the
Surviving Corporation (including the Surviving Corporations senior finance
and accounting personnel and its accountants) to the extent reasonably
required to permit the Voyager Stockholders Representative to review the
Preliminary Closing Statement. Within forty-five (45) days after receipt of
the Preliminary Closing Statement, the Voyager Stockholders Representative
may, in a written notice to Spinco, set forth in reasonable detail any
proposed adjustments to the items set forth on the Preliminary Closing
Statement and the reasons therefor (it being agreed that the only permitted
reasons for such adjustments shall be mathematical error or the failure to
compute items set forth therein in accordance with this Agreement). If Spinco
shall not have received a notice of proposed adjustments within such forty-
five (45)-day period from the Voyager Stockholders Representative, the
Voyager Stockholders Representative will be deemed to have accepted
irrevocably the Preliminary Closing Statement.

(c) The Voyager Stockholders Representative and Spinco shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve any disputes over any proposed adjustments to the
Preliminary Closing Statement during the thirty (30 days following Spincos
receipt of the proposed adjustments. If the Voyager Stockholders
Representative and Spinco are unable to resolve such dispute within such
thirty (30)-day period, then, at the written request of either such Party (the
" _Dispute Resolution Request_ "), each such Party shall appoint a
knowledgeable, responsible representative to meet in person and negotiate in
good faith to resolve the disputed matters. The Parties intend that these
negotiations be conducted by experienced business representatives empowered to
decide the issues. Such negotiations shall take place during the thirty

 



26  (30)-day period following the date of the Dispute Resolution Request. If the
business representatives resolve the dispute, such resolution shall
be memorialized in a written agreement (the Preliminary Closing Statement, as
revised by such negotiations, written agreement or the final decision of the
accounting firm referred to below, the " _Final Closing Statement_ "). If
the business representatives do not resolve the dispute during the periods
described above, then the Voyager Stockholders Representative and Spinco
shall jointly engage KPMG LLP to arbitrate and resolve such disputes, which
resolution shall be final, binding and enforceable in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 10.13_. If KPMG LLP is unable or unwilling to act as
arbitrator, a nationally recognized accounting firm shall be selected by lot
from among the remaining nationally recognized firms which are not the
regular independent auditor firm of Spinco or Voyager, and in such event
references herein to KPMG LLP shall be deemed to refer to such replacement
accounting firm. Within the thirty (30)-day period following its engagement,
KPMG LLP shall arbitrate and resolve such dispute based solely on the written
submissions provided by the Voyager Stockholders Representative and Spinco
and shall only consider whether the Preliminary Closing Statement (and each
component thereof) was prepared in accordance with this Agreement and (only
with respect to disputed matters submitted to the accounting firm) whether and
to what extent the Preliminary Closing Statement requires adjustment. In
resolving any disputed matter, KPMG LLP shall (i) adhere to the definitions
contained in this Agreement and the guidelines and principles of this
_Section_ __ _ 3.1_ and (ii) not assign a value to any item higher than the
highest value for such item claimed by the Voyager Stockholders
Representative and Spinco or lower than the lowest value claimed by either
such Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent the determination of
value of any disputed item affects any other item used in calculating the
Voyager Working Capital Adjustment or the Voyager Net Debt Adjustment, such
effect may be taken into account by KPMG LLP. The fees and expenses of KPMG
LLP shall be shared by the Voyager Stockholders Representative (on behalf of
the Voyager Stockholders) and Spinco in inverse proportion to the relative
amounts of the disputed amount determined in favor of the
Voyager Stockholders Representative and Spinco, respectively.

(d) Upon final determination of the Final Closing Statement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(c)_:

(i) If the Adjustment Amount is positive, Spinco shall pay to the Exchange
Agent the lesser of (A) one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) (less all
amounts paid or payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ hereof in respect of
Voyager Pre-Closing Taxes) and (B) the Adjustment Amount, which amount shall
be distributed to each Voyager Stockholder in such proportion as is
represented by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which is the number of shares
of Voyager Capital Stock held by each such Voyager Stockholder as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the denominator of which is
the Voyager Fully Diluted Share Number.

 

(ii) If the Adjustment Amount is negative, the Escrow Agent shall transfer
or cause to be transferred from the Escrow Account to Spinco a number of
shares of Spinco Common Stock having a value (determined in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement) equal to the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount,
and any such shares of Spinco Common Stock shall thereafter be canceled by
Spinco and no longer be outstanding.

(e) The Parties sole recourse with respect to the Adjustment Amount shall
be as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(d)_.

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no distribution of
Escrowed Shares or other adjustment under this _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ (or
portion thereof) shall be made to the extent the effect of such distribution
or adjustment (or portion thereof) would reasonably be expected to result in
the Harbor Stockholders owning fifty percent (50%) or less of Spinco Common
Stock (as measured for purposes of Section 355(e) of the Code) on or after the
Effective Time or otherwise cause a Tax-Free Transaction Failure.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF HARBOR, SPINCO AND MERGER SUB

 

Except as set forth in the correspondingly numbered Sections of the
Harbor/Spinco Disclosure Schedules, it being understood and agreed that each
disclosure set forth in the Harbor/Spinco Disclosure Schedules shall qualify
or modify each of the representations and warranties set forth in this
_Article_ __ _ IV_ to the extent the applicability of the disclosure to
such representation and warranty is readily apparent from the text of the
disclosure made (without reference to any additional information,
investigation, or documentation), Harbor, Spinco and Merger Sub hereby
represent and warrant to Voyager (which, in the case of _Section_ __ _
4.6(e)_, _Section_ __ _ 4.8(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 4.11(e)_, _Section_ __ _
4.12(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 4.14(a)_ through _(d_ ),  _Section_ __ _ 4.14(f)_,
_Section_ __ _ 4.16(b)_ and _(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 4.22(b)_ and _(c)_ ,

Section 4.1 _Due Organization, Good Standing, Corporate Power and
Subsidiaries_.

 

(a) Each of Harbor, Spinco and Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of
Delaware. Harbor and its Subsidiaries have all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate their properties and assets that will be
contributed to Spinco and the Spinco Subsidiaries pursuant to
the Distribution Agreement and to carry on the Spinco Business as it is now
being conducted. Each of Harbor and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions
which recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the property
owned, leased or operated by the Spinco Business that will be contributed to
Spinco and the Spinco Subsidiaries pursuant to the Distribution Agreement or
in which the nature of the Spinco Business conducted by it makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing has not had
or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Spinco Material Adverse Effect.

(b) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, each Spinco Subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid and non-assessable and are owned directly or
indirectly by Spinco, free and clear of all liens other than pursuant to the

Stockholder Approval, to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the Transaction Agreements by each of
Harbor, Spinco and Merger Sub, and the consummation by each of them of the
Transactions, have been duly and validly authorized by each of the Harbor
Board of Directors, Spinco Board of Directors and Merger Sub Board of
Directors, and no other corporate or other action on the part of Harbor,
Spinco or Merger Sub is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and

Directors, the Spinco Board of Directors and the Merger Sub Board of

to the Merger Sub Stockholder Approval (as defined below) and the Spinco
Board of Directors has recommended the affirmative vote of Harbor, as sole
stockholder of Spinco, with respect to the Spinco Stockholder Approval (as
defined below). The only approvals or consents of the holders of any class or
series of capital stock necessary to adopt this Agreement and the Transaction
Agreements and to approve the Merger and the Transactions are the affirmative
vote of Spinco, as sole stockholder of Merger Sub (the " _Merger
Sub Stockholder Approval_ ") and the affirmative vote of Harbor, as sole
stockholder of Spinco (the " _Spinco Stockholder Approval_ "), which each of
Merger Sub and Spinco shall obtain by written consent pursuant to Section

delivery of this Agreement. This Agreement and the Transaction Agreements have
been or shall be duly and validly executed and delivered by each of Harbor,
Spinco and Merger Sub, as applicable, and, to the extent it is a party
thereto, assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery hereof
and thereof by Voyager, each is a valid and binding obligation of each of
Harbor, Spinco and Merger Sub enforceable against each of Harbor, Spinco and
Merger Sub in accordance with their terms, except to the extent that its

benefits) in connection with the Transactions (either solely as a result
thereof or as a result of such Transactions in conjunction with any other

no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of
benefits) in connection with the Transactions (either solely as a result
thereof or as a result of such Transactions in conjunction with any other
event) could be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of section
280G of the Code, or would constitute an "excess parachute payment" if such
amounts were subject to the provisions of section 280G of the Code. Neither
Voyager nor any of its Subsidiaries or any Voyager Benefit Plan has any
indemnity or tax gross-up obligation to any Voyager Employee for any Taxes
imposed under Section 4999 or Section 409A, or otherwise, under the Code.

applicable to such Voyager Foreign Plan, (ii) all contributions to, and
payments from, such Voyager Foreign Plan that may have been required to be

and casualty, liability and other forms of insurance and/or insurance
arrangements, in such amounts, with such deductibles and against such risks
and losses as are, in Voyagers reasonable judgment, reasonable for its
business and its Subsidiaries. Except as has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Voyager Material
Adverse Effect, all such policies are in full force and effect, no invoiced

licensed or qualified and in good standing (or equivalent status as

good standing (or equivalent status as applicable), except as would not have a
Voyager Material Adverse Effect.

Harbor.

 

Section 5.22 _Controlled Substances_. No Voyager Entity has engaged in any
activities that constitute a material violation under the Controlled

any related state or local statutes or regulations concerning the purchasing,
dispensing, distribution or sale of controlled substances.

(a) To Voyagers Knowledge, none of the Voyager Entities, nor any of their

behalf of any Voyager Entity (acting in their respective capacities as
directors, officers, employees, independent contractors or agents), has made a
material violation of the Anti-Corruption Laws.

 



58 (b) To Voyagers Knowledge, there is no investigation of,
written allegation by, or request for information from, any Voyager Entity by
any Governmental Authority regarding the Anti-Corruption Laws that would
reasonably be expected to result in any material fine, penalty, or enforcement
action by such Governmental Authority.

To Voyagers Knowledge, no Voyager Entity, nor any current or former
directors, officers, employees, agents, independent contractors or other
parties acting on behalf of any Voyager entity or any of their Affiliates, has

in expectation of the transactions contemplated hereby) or as to the future
revenue, profitability or success of the business of Voyager, or any
representation or warranty arising from statute or otherwise in law.

the Effective Time and such acceleration, amendment or supplement would not
result in a Liability to any Spinco Entity. Without limiting the generality of
the immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)_
or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prevent Harbor or any of its respective
agents from amending or operating the Harbor 401(k) Plans as any such party
deems appropriate, in its sole discretion as permitted under such Harbor

pledge, encumber, transfer, license or otherwise dispose of, any of its
respective assets which, but for such disposition in contravention of this

results in the Prospectus or the Registration Statement containing an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitting to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or that
otherwise should be described in an amendment or supplement to the Prospectus
or the Registration Statement, the Parties shall promptly notify the other
Parties of the

 



69  occurrence of such event and then promptly prepare, file and clear with the
SEC such amendment or supplement and Spinco shall, as may be required by the
SEC, mail to the Harbor Stockholders and the Voyager Stockholders each such
amendment or supplement.

Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated

respective Affiliates or agree to make any material changes or restriction on,
or other impairment of Voyagers, Harbors or either of their respective
Affiliates ability to own, operate or exercise rights in respect of such
assets, Licenses, operations, rights, product lines, business or interests
therein; _provided_ further, however, that none of Harbor, Voyager or the
Voyager Stockholders shall have an obligation to litigate against any
Governmental Authority or private party seeking to enjoin the Closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) From the date hereof until the date on which the condition set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(f)_ is satisfied, Voyager, Harbor, Spinco and their
respective Affiliates shall not acquire or agree to acquire by merging or
consolidating with, or by purchasing any equity interest in or the assets of,
or by any other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership,
association or other business organization or

 



72  division thereof that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay any filing or approval with or from any Governmental Authority to
consummate the Transactions or which could reasonably be expected to
materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Transactions or result in
the failure to satisfy any condition to consummation of the Transactions.

 

(c) _IRS Rulings and Opinions_.

 

(i) Harbor shall determine, in its reasonable discretion, whether to obtain
the IRS Rulings. Harbor and Spinco shall use their reasonable best efforts to
seek, as promptly as practicable, any private letter rulings from the IRS that
Harbor in its reasonable discretion has determined to obtain, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Harbor (the " _IRS Rulings_ "), and an
opinion of Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP (the " _Spin-Off Tax
Opinion_"), (A) to the effect that (I) the transactions that comprise
the Distribution will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, (II) Harbor will recognize no gain or loss
under Section 361(c) of the Code upon the Distribution and (III) Harbors
stockholders will recognize no gain or loss under Section 355(a) of the Code
upon the receipt of Spinco Common Stock in the Distribution and (B) covering
any other matters reasonably requested by Harbor. The IRS Rulings and the
Spin-Off Tax Opinion may be based upon customary factual statements,
representations and covenants by the Parties, their Subsidiaries and their
stockholders. Voyager agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts
to, and to cause its Subsidiaries to, assist in obtaining the IRS Rulings and
the Spin-Off Tax Opinion, including by providing such appropriate information,
representations and covenants as the IRS or Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton
LLP shall reasonably require in connection with the IRS Rulings or the Spin-
Off Tax Opinion.

 

(ii) Harbor, in consultation with Voyager, shall be responsible for the
preparation and filing of all ruling requests and supplements thereto to be
submitted to the IRS in connection with the IRS Rulings, if any (the " _IRS
Submissions_ "). Harbor shall provide Voyager with consultation rights and a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on a draft of the IRS
Submissions to the extent filed after the date hereof; _provided_ , that such
rights shall not result in unreasonable delays in submitting the IRS
Submissions to the IRS. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Harbor may redact from
any IRS Submission any information (" _Redactable Information_ ") that (x)
Harbor, in its good faith judgment, considers to be Confidential Information
or legal analysis/qualifications which in either case are not information
about Voyager or its Subsidiaries or the actions that Spinco or its
Subsidiaries will take (or refrain from taking) after the Distribution and (y)
is not (and is not reasonably expected to become) a part of any other publicly
available information. No IRS Submission shall be filed with the IRS after
the date hereof unless, prior to such filing, Voyager shall have agreed (which
agreement shall not be withheld unreasonably, conditioned or delayed) as to
the contents of such IRS Submission, to the extent that such contents include
information about Voyager or its Subsidiaries or the actions that Spinco or
its Subsidiaries will take (or refrain from taking) after the Distribution.
Harbor shall provide Voyager with copies of each IRS Submission as filed with
the IRS promptly following the filing thereof (subject to the proviso
regarding Redactable Information, below). Harbor shall use its reasonable best
efforts to notify Voyager of any substantive communications with or from the
IRS regarding any material issue arising with respect to the IRS Rulings,
including, without limitation, the IRS Submissions, _provided_ , that Harbor
may redact from such IRS Submission any Redactable Information prior to
providing such IRS Submission to Voyager.

(iii) Harbor and Voyager shall cooperate with each other in obtaining, and
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain (and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries and stockholders to cooperate in obtaining and
use their reasonable best efforts to obtain), a written opinion of their
respective tax counsel, Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP, in the case of
Harbor and Spinco, and Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP, in the case of Voyager, in
form and substance reasonably

 



73  satisfactory to Harbor and Voyager, respectively (each such opinion, a "
_Merger Tax Opinion_ "), dated as of the Effective Time, to the effect that,
on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth in such
opinion, the Merger will be treated as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code; _provided_ , that, if Harbor obtains an
IRS Ruling providing that the Merger will be treated as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code, then Harbor may choose
in its sole discretion to waive the requirement that it obtain the Merger Tax
Opinion by Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP and Voyager may choose in its
sole discretion to waive the requirement that it obtain the Merger Tax Opinion
from Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP. Each of the Parties shall deliver, if
applicable, to Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP and Morgan, Lewis and
Bockius LLP, for purposes of the Merger Tax Opinions (and shall cause their
Subsidiaries and stockholders to deliver) such appropriate information and
customary representations and covenants reasonably satisfactory in form and
substance to Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP and Morgan, Lewis and Bockius
LLP.

written documentation of such approvals to Voyager.

 

(b) Voyager shall, from the date hereof until the Voyager Stockholders
Meeting, use commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary in

is scheduled, Voyager has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of votes to obtain the

 



74  Voyager Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, Voyager
shall have the right to make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Voyager Stockholders Meeting; provided, that the Voyager
Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than
thirty (30) days after the date for which the Voyager Stockholders Meeting was
originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements required by
applicable Law).

(e) Voyager agrees that its obligations to hold the Voyager Stockholders

commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to Voyager
of any Voyager Acquisition Proposal.

Representatives, as the case may be, may reasonably request, and instruct its
employees, legal counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
Representatives to reasonably cooperate with the other in such other Partys
investigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not permit
any Party to conduct any invasive or destructive environmental sampling,
testing or analysis (including without limitation any of the nature commonly
referred to as a "Phase II" environmental assessment) on the other Partys
property.

 

(b) For the purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, all communications,
including requests for information or access, pursuant to this _Section_ __ _

with any Consent previously given by any natural person relating to the
collection, acquisition, storage, protection, use, disclosure, transfer or any
other processing (as defined by any applicable Law) of data (including
Personal Information); _provided_ , that the Parties shall have used
reasonable best efforts to make such disclosure in a form or manner that would
not jeopardize such privilege or violate such Law, fiduciary
duty, confidentiality obligations or Consent (including by redacting or

jeopardize such privilege or entering into a joint defense agreement). Each of
Voyager, Spinco and Harbor will hold, and will cause their respective
Subsidiaries to hold, and will direct its and their Representatives to hold,
any and all information received from any of the Parties, directly or
indirectly, in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement

and present directors or officers of Harbor, Spinco, Voyager and their
respective Subsidiaries, and each individual who prior to the Effective Time
becomes a director or officer of Harbor, Spinco, Voyager or their

their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, in each case, as of the date
hereof, and (ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any
respect that would adversely affect the rights of those Persons thereunder, in

referred to in clause (a) above for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time policies of directors and officers liability insurance and

_provided_ , that such policies shall be no less favorable than the more

assign, as applicable, assumes the covenants and agreements set forth in this

release or make any such public announcement prior to such consultation and
without the consent of the other Parties, which consent shall not be

such Action without the prior written consent of the other Parties if (a) such
Action would prevent or materially delay the Transactions (including the
Separation and the Merger) or involves injunctive or equitable relief or (b)
a settlement of such Action would impose Liability on Harbor, Spinco, Voyager
or any of their respective Subsidiaries. Each of Harbor, Spinco and Voyager
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its Affiliates,
directors and officers to use its reasonable best efforts to defend any such
Action in which such Affiliate, director or officer is named as a defendant

the same extent as if such Person was a Party.

shall promptly notify the other Parties of: (a) any notice or other
communication received by such Party from any Person alleging that the

reasonably be expected to have a Spinco Material Adverse Effect or Voyager
Material Adverse Effect, (b) any notice or other substantive
communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of
such communication would reasonably be expected to be material to Harbor,
Spinco, Voyager or the Spinco Business; (c) the occurrence, or nonoccurrence,
of any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which could reasonably be

_Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)(i)_ or (ii) hereof, as applicable, would be incapable
of being fulfilled as of the Closing Date; (d) the occurrence, or
nonoccurrence, of any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which has

thereof, the condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)(iii)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)(iii)_ hereof, as applicable, would be incapable of
being fulfilled as of the Closing Date; and (f) any Action in which such Party
is named as a defendant that challenges or otherwise seeks to enjoin,
restrain or prohibit the Transactions; _ provided_, that the failure to
deliver any notice pursuant to this _ Section_ __ _ 6.14_ shall not be
considered in determining whether the conditions set forth in _ Article_ __

whether the conditions set forth in _ Article_ __ _ VII_ have been
satisfied.

other than as expressly permitted pursuant to this Agreement, the
Distribution Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements, without the prior
written consent of the other Party, any and all Confidential Information
concerning the other Party or such Partys Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that
the Parties may disclose, or may permit disclosure of, Confidential
Information (i) to their respective Representatives who have a need to know

if the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates that receive Confidential
Information or are controlled by the applicable Party are requested or
required to disclose any such Confidential Information by oral questions,

possession confidential or proprietary information of third parties that was
received under confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements or agreements
containing confidentiality or non-disclosure provisions that the other Party

Such Party will hold, and will cause its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives to hold, in strict confidence the confidential and
proprietary information of third parties to which they or any of its
respective Affiliates has had access, in accordance with the terms of such
agreements entered into prior to the Effective Time or, if more restrictive,

Party shall, in its discretion, promptly return to such requesting Party or
cause to be destroyed all Confidential Information furnished to it or to any
of its Affiliates; _provided_ that if specifically requested by such
requesting Party, the other Party shall destroy any copies of such
Confidential Information (including any extracts therefrom), unless, in each
case, such return or destruction would violate any Law. Upon the written 

 



78  request of such requesting Party, the other Party shall cause one of its
duly authorized officers to certify promptly in writing to such requesting
Party that all Confidential Information has been returned, destroyed or
deleted as required by the preceding sentence.

(e) Harbor and Voyager acknowledge that they have previously executed the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms and that the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
6.15_ are in furtherance of, and do not limit the obligations of, Harbor and
Voyager under the Confidentiality Agreement. If the Closing occurs, this
_Section_ __ _ 6.15_ shall terminate on the two year anniversary of the
Closing Date. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the provision
of Tax Returns and other Confidential Information relating to Tax matters
shall be exclusively governed by the Tax Matters Agreement and, to the extent

(b) Each of Voyager and Spinco agrees that, for a period of eighteen (18)

Section 6.19 _Covenant Not to Compete_.

 

(a) Harbor hereby acknowledges and agrees that Spinco, the Surviving
Corporation and the Spinco Business would be irreparably damaged if Harbor or
its Subsidiaries were to, directly or indirectly, engage in the Restricted
Business and that doing so would result in a significant loss of goodwill and
value by Spinco and the Spinco Business. Therefore, in further consideration
of the consummation of the Transactions, the Special Dividend, the Additional
Special Dividend (if applicable) and other good and valuable consideration for
the Spinco Common Stock and goodwill of Spinco, Harbor covenants and
agrees that, for a period of three (3) years from and after the Closing Date,
neither Harbor nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, without the prior written
consent of Spinco, directly or indirectly, either for itself or for any other
Person, own or acquire any interest in, operate, manage, control, or engage
in, any business or Person that engages in the Restricted Business.

 

(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, nothing set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.19_ shall prohibit Harbor or any of its Subsidiaries from:

(i) engaging in, owning any interest in, or controlling, managing or
operating any Person engaging in, any business other than the Restricted
Business;

(ii) acquiring (by asset purchase, stock purchase, merger, consolidation
or otherwise), directly or indirectly, the stock, business or assets of any
Person that at the time of such acquisition is engaged in, or owns any
interest in or controls, manages, or operates any Person that is engaged in,
the Restricted Business that would otherwise be prohibited by _Section_ __ _
6.19(a)_ (such Restricted Business being referred to herein as an " _Acquired
Competing Business_ ");  _provided_ , that Harbor or any of its Subsidiaries
shall not be prohibited from acquiring such Acquired Competing Business so
long as (x) the annual net revenues of the Acquired Competing Business do not
exceed the lesser of (A) $10,000,000 or (B) twenty five percent (25%) of the
annual net revenues of the combined businesses being acquired (the " _Non-
Competing Business Threshold_") or (y) if the Non-Competing Business Threshold
is exceeded (A) the annual net revenues of the Acquired Competing Business do
not

 



81  exceed 40% of the annual net revenues of the combined business being
acquired and (B) Harbor divests or terminates (or cause its Subsidiaries, if
applicable, to divest or terminate) the portion of such Acquired Competing
Business that generates net revenues in excess of the Non-Competing Business
Threshold within eighteen (18) months of the consummation of such acquisition;

 

(iii) subject to the conditions set forth in clause (ii), engaging in,
owning any interest in, or controlling, managing or operating any Person
engaging in, any Acquired Competing Business in a manner and on a scale
consistent with the conduct of such business immediately prior to the
acquisition of such business;

 

(iv) owning, directly or indirectly, as a passive, non-controlling
investor (without any membership on the board of directors or similar
governing body of such Person), up to an aggregate of (x) ten percent (10%) of

publicly-listed on a national stock exchange or (y) five percent (5%) of the
outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of any other Person; or

 

(v) engaging in, owning any equity interest in, or participating in the
management of, any Person in which Harbor or its Subsidiaries owns an equity
interest as of the date hereof and which is not a consolidated entity of
Harbor for purposes of its financial reporting.

upon reasonable written notice, Harbor and Spinco will make or cause to be
made available to the other Parties, as applicable, and their respective
Representatives, during regular business hours, all information and
assistance as is necessary for any reasonable business purpose relating to the
Spinco Business, including, financial reporting and accounting matters and in
connection with any disclosure obligation or the defense of any
Action (except in the event the Parties are opposing one another in an
Action, in which case normal discovery rules shall apply), and (b) except as
otherwise provided in the Transition Service Agreement (or any schedule or
supplement thereto) which shall control in the event of any conflict with
this subsection (b), upon reasonable written notice, Harbor shall (provided
that Spinco will reimburse Harbor for any reasonable out-of-pocket fees and

shall offer to transfer such records to the other Party at the end of any such
period by providing the other Party with not less than twenty (20) days
written notice of its intention to destroy or dispose of such records so that
such other Party may exercise its rights to obtain such records within such
twenty (20) day period. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, (x) other than with respect to Voyager Pre-Closing Taxes (in
connection with _Section_ __ _ 9.2_), information provision and record
retention relating to Tax matters shall be exclusively governed by the Tax
Matters Agreement and, to the extent applicable, the Distribution Agreement
and the Employee Matters Agreement (as applicable), and not this Agreement and
(y) Harbor and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to provide access,
retain or disclose information (including any Personal Information), where

of the Harbor Business or the Spinco Business, (2) Contract to which Harbor or
any of its Subsidiaries are bound or (3) Consent previously given by any

irrevocably guarantees, as a principal and not as a surety, to Voyager the
prompt and full payment and performance of the obligations of Spinco under
this Agreement (the " _Harbor Obligations_ " and such guarantee, the " _Harbor
Guarantee_ "). Voyager may seek remedies directly from Harbor with respect to
the Harbor Obligations without first exhausting its remedies against Spinco.
The liability of Harbor hereunder is, in all cases, subject to all defenses,
setoffs and counterclaims available to Spinco with respect to performance or
payment of the Harbor Obligations. Harbor waives presentment, demand and any
other notice with respect to any of the Harbor Obligations and any defenses
that Harbor may have with respect to any of the Harbor Obligations other than
as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, the guarantee set forth in this _Section_ __
_ 6.26_ shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the
earlier to occur of (i) the Closing, and (ii) termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and the payment of any amounts required to be
paid in connection therewith.

 

Section 6.27 _Voyager Stockholders_ __ _Representative_.

 

(a) The Voyager Stockholders have designated Shareholder Representative
Services LLC as the initial Voyager Stockholders Representative for certain
limited purposes set forth herein and Shareholder Representative Services LLC
hereby agrees to act in such capacity effective as of the Effective Time. By
virtue of the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the Voyager
Stockholders without any further action on the part of the Voyager
Stockholders or Voyager, Shareholder Representative Services LLC is hereby
appointed as the exclusive representative, agent and attorney-in-fact of the
Voyager Stockholders for all purposes in connection with this Agreement and
the agreements ancillary hereto. Furthermore, such Voyager Stockholder shall
have the benefit of the Voyager Stockholders Representative exercising the
rights set forth herein with respect to such Voyager Stockholder.

 

(b) The Voyager Stockholders Representative shall have such powers and
authority as are necessary to carry out the functions assigned to it under
this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, the Voyager
Stockholders Representative shall have full power, authority and discretion
to act on behalf of the Voyager Stockholders in connection with the
transactions contemplated by _Article_ __ _ III_ of this Agreement, including
executing documents, making all elections and decisions to be made by the
Voyager Stockholders in connection with the transactions contemplated by
_Article_ __ _ III_ of this Agreement, giving and receiving notices on behalf
of the Voyager Stockholders and receiving any materials and disputing the
matters contained therein pursuant to _Article_ __ _ III_. A decision,
action, consent, instruction or omission of the Voyager Stockholders
Representative (acting in its capacity as the Voyager Stockholders
Representative) shall constitute a decision, action, consent, instruction or
omission of each Voyager Stockholder and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each Voyager Stockholder. Harbor, Spinco and the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to
rely upon any decision, action, consent, instruction or omission of the
Voyager Stockholders Representative relating to the

 



85  transactions contemplated in _Article_ __ _ III_ as being the decision,
action, consent, instruction or omission of each Voyager Stockholder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, each Voyager Stockholder, on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates, Representatives, successors and assigns,
voluntarily, irrevocably, unconditionally and completely waives and releases,
acquits and forever discharges Harbor and its Subsidiaries, and each of their
respective present and future Affiliates, and their respective directors,
officers, shareholders, partners, members, agents and Representatives, and the
predecessors, successors and assigns of each of the foregoing (each such
persons collectively, the " _Released Parties_ ") from any and all claims,
demands, rights, promises, causes of actions, suits, expenses, damages,
Liabilities and obligations of any nature whatsoever (whether based on
any Law, known or unknown, suspected or claimed, fixed or contingent, matured
or unmatured, determined or determinable, at Law or in equity in any way
arising out of or based on any action or omission of the Voyager Stockholders
Representative, the appointment of the Voyager Stockholders Representative,
any obligations of the Voyager Stockholders Representative under this
Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in connection herewith, or
any actions or omissions of any Released Party taken in reliance upon any
decision, action, consent, instruction or omission of the Voyager
Stockholders Representative, in each case pursuant to or in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 6.27_.

 

(c) The Voyager Stockholders Representative shall at all times be entitled
to engage such counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as it shall
deem necessary in connection with exercising its powers and performing its
function hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Voyager
Stockholders Representative) shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the
opinions and advice of such Persons. The Voyager Stockholders Representative
will incur no liability of any kind with respect to any action or omission by
the Voyager Stockholders Representative in connection with its services
pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, except in the
event of liability directly resulting from the Voyager Stockholders
Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Voyager Stockholders Representative shall not be liable for any action or
omission pursuant to the advice of counsel. The Voyager Stockholders shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Voyager Stockholders Representative
from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties,
fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and
expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document
location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_
") arising out of or in connection with the Voyager Stockholders
Representatives execution and performance of this Agreement and any
agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is
suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that in the event that any such
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Voyager
Stockholders Representative, the Voyager Stockholders Representative will
reimburse the Voyager Stockholders the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or
willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Voyager Stockholders
Representative by the Voyager Stockholders, any such Representative Losses may
be recovered by the Voyager Stockholders Representative from (i) the funds in
the Expense Fund and (ii) any other amounts that become payable to the
Voyager Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement or the agreements ancillary
hereto at such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to
the Voyager Stockholders; _provided_ , that while this section allows the
Voyager Stockholders Representative to be paid from the aforementioned
sources of funds, this does not relieve the Voyager Stockholders from their
obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered
or incurred, nor does it prevent the Voyager Stockholders Representative
from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event
will the Voyager Stockholders Representative be required to advance its own
funds on behalf of the Voyager Stockholders or otherwise. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on
liability or indemnification obligations of the Voyager Stockholders set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the
indemnities provided to the Voyager Stockholders Representative under this
section. The foregoing indemnities will

 



86  survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of the Voyager Stockholders
Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

 

(d) The Voyager Stockholders Representative Expense Fund Amount (also
referred to herein as the " _Expense Fund_ "), will be used for the purposes
of paying directly, or reimbursing the Voyager Stockholders Representative
for, any third party expenses pursuant to this Agreement and the agreements
ancillary hereto. The Voyager Stockholders will not receive any interest or
earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Voyager Stockholders Representative any ownership right that they may
otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The
Voyager Stockholders Representative will not be liable for any loss of
principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence
or willful misconduct. The Voyager Stockholders Representative will hold
these funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for
its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not
voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of
bankruptcy. As soon as practicable following the completion of the Voyager
Stockholders Representatives responsibilities, the Voyager Stockholders
Representative shall disburse any remaining balance of the Expense Fund to the
Exchange Agent for further distribution to the Voyager Stockholders. For tax
purposes, the Expense Fund shall be treated as having been received and
voluntarily set aside by the Voyager Stockholders at the time of Closing. The
Voyager Stockholders Representative is not acting as a withholding agent or
in any similar capacity in connection with the Expense Fund and is not
responsible for any tax reporting or withholding with respect thereto.

 

(e) The Voyager Stockholders Representative hereby represents and warrants
to each of Harbor, Spinco, Merger Sub and Voyager as follows: (i) the Voyager
Stockholders Representative has all requisite limited liability company power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, (ii) the execution and
delivery by the Voyager Stockholders Representative of this Agreement and
the performance by the Voyager Stockholders Representative of its obligations
hereunder do not and will not conflict with, violate any provision of, any
applicable Law or Contract applicable to the Voyager Stockholders
Representative, and (iii) this Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by the Voyager Stockholders Representative, constitutes a valid
and binding agreement of the Voyager Stockholders Representative and is
enforceable against the Voyager Stockholders Representative in accordance
with its terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may be subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar Laws, now or hereinafter in effect, affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and by general equitable principles.

 

(f) The Voyager Stockholders Representative may resign at any time, to be
effective upon thirty (30) days written notice, or may be removed at any time
by written agreement of Voyager Stockholders holding a majority of the shares
of Voyager Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. A vacancy in the position of Voyager Stockholders
Representative may be filled by the written agreement of Voyager Stockholders
holding a majority of the shares of Voyager Capital Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(including litigation) between any of Harbor or Spinco, on the one hand, and
the Voyager Stockholders Representative and/or any Voyager Stockholder, on

hereby, neither Harbor nor Spinco shall have the right to assert the

Stockholders Representative and/or the Voyager Stockholders, as applicable,
only such Persons shall hold such property rights and (ii) any attorney-
client privilege or attorney work product protection applicable to such
Voyager Privileged Communications shall belong to and be controlled by the
Voyager Stockholders Representative and the Voyager Stockholders, as
applicable, and may be asserted or waived only by the Voyager Stockholders
Representative or the Voyager Stockholders, as applicable, and not by Harbor
or Spinco, and shall not pass to or be claimed or used by Harbor or Spinco;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any attorney-client privilege and attorney work-
product protection shall also belong to and be controlled by Harbor or Spinco,
as applicable, to the extent any such attorney-client privilege or
attorney work-product protection is required to be waived or otherwise
required to be similarly released by any Governmental Authority or third party
under applicable Laws or pursuant to any Order entered by or with any
Governmental Authority or any arbitration panel, tribunal or arbitrator;

confidence. For the avoidance of doubt, none of Spinco, Harbor or their
respective Affiliates shall have the obligation to delete or remove such
Voyager Privileged Communications from their servers or technology
infrastructure except upon the written request of the Voyager Stockholders
Representative, and any such removal shall be at the sole cost and expense of
the Voyager Stockholders or the Voyager Stockholders Representative (on
behalf of the Voyager Stockholders) and subject to compliance with applicable
Laws.

(b) Harbor, Spinco, and the Voyager Stockholders agree that, in
any dispute (including litigation) between any of Harbor or any its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one hand, and Spinco, the Voyager
Stockholders Representative and/or any Voyager Stockholder, on the other
hand, regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, none
of Spinco, Voyager, the Voyager Stockholders Representative and/or any
Voyager Stockholder shall have the right to assert the attorney/client
privilege or the attorney work product doctrine as to pre-Closing
communications between the Harbor, any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
(including Spinco or any other member of the Spinco Group) or any officer,
director or employee of such Persons on the one hand (the " _Harbor Clients_
"), and Proskauer Rose LLP or Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP (" _Harbor_
__ _s Counsel_ "), on the other hand, to the extent that the privileged
communications or attorney work product relate to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. (i) To the extent the information and
documents, including electronic records, that were generated and maintained by
the Harbor Clients or Harbors Counsel as a result of Harbors Counsels
representation of or advice to the Harbor Clients that solely relate to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Harbor Privileged
Communications_ ") constitute property of the Harbor, only Harbor shall hold
such property rights and (ii) any attorney-client privilege or attorney work
product protection applicable to such Harbor Privileged Communications shall
belong to and be controlled by the Harbor and may be asserted or waived only
by Harbor, and not by Spinco, the Voyager Stockholders Representative or the
Voyager Stockholders, and shall not pass to or be claimed or used by such
Persons; _provided_ , _however_ , that any attorney-client privilege and
attorney work-product protection shall also belong to and be controlled by
Spinco to the extent any such attorney-client privilege or attorney work-
product protection is required to be waived or otherwise required to
be similarly released by any Governmental Authority or third party under
applicable Laws or pursuant to any Order entered by

 



88  or with any Governmental Authority or any arbitration panel, tribunal or
arbitrator; _provided_ , _further_ , that Spinco shall notify Harbor, of any
such requirement in advance of any such waiver or release and, upon request,
by Harbor, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Harbor
to put in place arrangements that comply with such Laws and Orders in a manner
that would not waive or release any such attorney-client privilege, attorney
work-product protection or client confidence. For the avoidance of doubt, none
of Spinco, the Voyager Stockholders Representative or the Voyager
Stockholders, as applicable shall have the obligation to delete or remove
such Harbor Privileged Communications from their servers or technology
infrastructure except upon the written request of Harbor, and any such removal
shall be at the sole cost and expense of Harbor and subject to compliance
with applicable Laws.

Section 6.29 _Release of Voyager Encumbrances_ _._ Voyager shall, and
shall cause each of its applicable Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best
efforts to cause the release of all Encumbrances set forth on _Section_ __ _

Section 6.30 _Restructuring Step Plan_. Harbor shall consult in good faith
with Voyager and its professional advisers regarding the material aspects of
the Restructuring Step Plan, including the form and manner thereof. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Harbor shall promptly provide
Voyager with each updated draft or revision of the Restructuring Step Plan
that reflect material updates or material revisions (as redacted or otherwise
revised by Harbor to remove any information Harbor reasonably determines may
be Privileged Information), and shall consider in good faith
comments provided by Voyager and its professional advisers in implementing

Article VIII

 

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 

Section 8.1 _Termination or Abandonment_. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated
and abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
any approval of the matters presented in connection with the Transactions by
any stockholders required to approve the Transactions:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Harbor and Voyager;

 

(b) by either Harbor or Voyager if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred on or before the date occurring fifteen (15) months after the date
of this Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ "), unless the failure of the
Effective Time to have occurred by the Termination Date shall be due to the
failure of the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_ to perform or otherwise comply with in all material
respects the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein.

 

(c) by Voyager (so long as, at the time of termination, Voyager is not in
breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or other agreement
contained herein, which breach would cause the Closing conditions of Harbor or
Spinco not to be satisfied if the Closing were to occur at the time of
termination), if there has been a breach by Harbor or Spinco of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement such that _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ hereof would be incapable of being
satisfied, and such breach or condition has not been cured within thirty (30)
Business Days following receipt by Harbor or Spinco, if applicable, of notice
of such breach;

(d) by Harbor (so long as, at the time of termination, Harbor is not in
breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or other agreement
contained herein which breach would cause the Closing conditions of Voyager
not to be satisfied if the Closing were to occur at the time of termination),
if there has been a breach by Voyager of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement such that
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ hereof would be incapable of being satisfied, and
such breach or condition has not been cured within thirty (30) Business Days
following receipt by Voyager of notice of such breach;

 

(e) by Harbor if the Support Agreements in respect of shares of Voyager
capital stock sufficient to effect the Voyager Stockholder Approval at the
Voyager Stockholders Meeting have not

 



92  been executed and delivered to Harbor within seventy-two (72) hours
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement; or

 

(f) by either Harbor or Voyager if any Law or Order by any Governmental
Authority preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Transactions shall
have become final and non-appealable.

The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 8.1_ will give written notice of such termination to the other Party,
specifying the provision pursuant to which such termination is effected.

 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated by
Harbor or Voyager pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1 _hereof, then this
Agreement shall become void and have no effect with no Liability on the part
of the Parties, except to the extent that such termination results from the
fraud or intentional breach by a Party of any of its covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement, _Section_ __ _ 6.27(c)_, this _Section_ __ _
8.2_,  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ and _Article_ __ _ X_ shall remain in full force
and effect and shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) _General Rule_. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section_ __ _
8.3_, this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement, or unless otherwise
mutually agreed to by Harbor and Voyager in writing, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Transactions (including all Transaction
Expenses) shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees or expenses (it
being agreed for clarification that any fees and expenses incurred by Spinco
or any of its Subsidiaries on or prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed
to have been incurred by Harbor).

 

(b) _Shared Expenses_ _._ All Shared Expenses shall be borne (i) by Spinco
if the Merger is consummated or (ii) 50% by Harbor and 50% by Voyager, other
than respect to the Spinco Financing which shall be borne 60% by Harbor and
40% by Voyager, if the Merger is not consummated. At or prior to the Closing,
Spinco shall reimburse Harbor for any Shared Expenses paid by such Person in
order to give effect to the obligations set forth in subsection (i) of the
foregoing sentence. Harbor and/or Voyager, as applicable, shall reimburse the
other for Shared Expenses in order to give effect to the obligations set
forth in subsection (ii) of the foregoing sentence.

 



93 Article IX

 

SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; PRE-CLOSING TAX INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 9.1 _Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties; Survival
of Certain Covenants_. Except as provided in Section 6.1 of the Distribution
Agreement with respect to the representations set forth in _Section_ __ _
4.7_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.7_, none of the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements in this Agreement or in the certificates delivered
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ and _Section_ __
_ 7.3(c)_ of this Agreement will survive the Effective Time or termination
of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the covenants and agreements
contained in _Article_ __ _ II_, _Article_ __ _ III_,  _Article_ __ _ VI_,
_Article_ __ _ VIII_ and this _Article_ __ _ IX_ (and any related
definitions) that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in
part after the Effective Time (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
_Section_ __ _ 9.2_) shall survive the Effective Time with respect to the
portion of such covenant to be performed after the Effective Time.

 

Section 9.2 _Voyager Pre-Closing Tax Indemnity_.

 

(a) The Voyager Stockholders agree to indemnify and hold harmless Spinco
and its Affiliates (each of the foregoing being referred to individually as a
" _Spinco Indemnified Person_ " and collectively as the " _Spinco Indemnified
Persons_ ") from and against any and all Taxes or Tax-related Losses incurred
or sustained by any Spinco Tax Entity in respect of any Voyager Pre-Closing
Taxes, up to an amount not to exceed ten million dollars ($10,000,000) in the
aggregate; _provided_ , that Spincos rights under this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_
shall only apply with respect to claims made by any Spinco Indemnified Person
(including with respect to Third-Party Claims resulting in such foregoing
Losses) that are first made no later than the first (1st) anniversary of the
Closing Date. The Escrowed Shares shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for
indemnifiable matters under this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Voyager Stockholders tax indemnity in this _Section_ __ _
9.2_ shall not apply with respect to a Voyager Pre-Closing Tax to the extent
that the Liability for the Voyager Pre-Closing Tax (in the amount of such Tax
indemnifiable under this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_) has otherwise been included in
the calculation of the Voyager Working Capital Adjustment.

(b) When making indemnification payments pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
9.2_, the Escrow Agent shall distribute an amount of Escrowed Shares to Spinco
as set forth in the Escrow Agreement having a value (determined in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement) equal to the amount of such Tax indemnifiable
under this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, and any such shares of Spinco Common Stock
shall thereafter be canceled by Spinco and no longer be outstanding.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no distribution of Escrowed
Shares shall be made to the extent the effect of such distribution would
reasonably be expected to result in the Harbor Stockholders owning fifty
percent (50%) or less of Spinco Common Stock (as measured for purposes
of Section 355(e) of the Code) on or after the Effective Time or otherwise
cause a Tax-Free Transaction Failure; _provided_ , that in such event,
Spincos right to indemnification hereunder will be limited to such number of
Escrowed Shares as may be distributed consistent with the foregoing clause.

(c) Upon the later to occur of (i) the date occurring on the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) the date on which the final
outstanding claim made pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_ is resolved,
following the release of any indemnification payments made by the Escrow Agent
to Spinco pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, any Escrowed Shares then
remaining in the Escrow Account shall be distributed to each Voyager
Stockholder in such proportion as is represented by a fraction, (x) the
numerator of which is the number of shares of Voyager Capital Stock held by
each such Voyager Stockholder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (y) the denominator of which is the Voyager Fully Diluted Share Number.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no distribution

 



94  of Escrowed Shares shall be made to the extent the effect of such
distribution would reasonably be expected to result in the Harbor Stockholders
owning fifty percent (50%) or less of Spinco Common Stock (as measured for
purposes of Section 355(e) of the Code) on or after the Effective Time or
otherwise cause a Tax-Free Transaction Failure.

 

(d) The Parties agree that the indemnification provisions of Section 6.4
and Section 6.6 of the Distribution Agreement shall be deemed to be
incorporated _mutatis mutandis_ into this Agreement (treating the Voyager
Stockholders as the relevant indemnifying party, and the Spinco Indemnified
Persons as the relevant indemnitees thereunder), and to apply solely with
respect to this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this
_Section_ __ _ 9.2_ shall survive until the first (1st) anniversary of the
Closing Date; _provided_ , that any claim asserted within the survival
period shall have been timely made for purposes of this _Section_ __ _
9.2(e)_ and shall survive until that claim has been fully and finally
resolved.

 

Section 9.3 _Coordination with other Indemnity Provisions_. Harbors
indemnity with respect to certain pre-Closing Tax matters is set forth in the
Tax Matters Agreement and Harbors indemnity with respect to the non-Tax
matters specified therein in the Distribution Agreement. Indemnities with
respect to Taxes other than Voyager Pre-Closing Taxes shall be governed
exclusively by the Tax Matters Agreement (or, as applicable, the Employee
Matters Agreement), and not this Agreement.

other documents referred to herein and therein shall constitute the entire
agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
shall supersede all previous negotiations, commitments and writings with
respect to such subject matter.

 

Section 10.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
benefits or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any of the Parties
(whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other Parties, and any purported assignment without such consent shall
be null and void, except that Spinco may assign any or all of its rights and
interests under this Agreement without the consent of the other Parties hereto
(a) to any Person providing the Spinco Financing pursuant to the terms thereof
for purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assign as
collateral in respect of such Spinco Financing or (b) to any purchaser of all
or substantially all of the assets of such Person; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, in each case, no such assignment shall release Spinco from
any liability or obligation under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

 

Section 10.6 _Governing Law; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

 

(a) This Agreement and all issues and questions concerning the
construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement (and
all Schedules and Exhibits hereto) shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the internal Laws of the State of Delaware shall
control the interpretation and construction of this Agreement (and all
Schedules and Exhibits hereto), even though under that jurisdictions choice
of law or conflict of law analysis, the substantive Law of some other
jurisdiction would ordinarily apply. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, (A) each of the Parties (on behalf of itself, its Subsidiaries and
the directors, officers, employees, consultants, financial advisors,
accountants, legal counsel, investment bankers, and other agents,
advisors and representatives of each of them) agrees that any claim,
controversy or dispute of any kind or nature (whether based upon contract,
tort or otherwise) against a Lender or Lender Related Party that is in any way
related to this Agreement, the Separation, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Spinco Financing, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard
to conflict of law principles (other than Sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of the
New York General Obligations Law); _provided_ that (1) the interpretation of
the definitions of Spinco Material Adverse Effect and Voyager Material Adverse
Effect and whether or not a Spinco Material Adverse Effect or a Voyager
Material Adverse

  



98  Effect has occurred, (2) the determination of the accuracy of any
representations made in this Agreement and whether as a result of any
inaccuracy thereof Harbor or Voyager has the right to terminate its
obligations under this Agreement, or to decline to consummate the Transactions
pursuant to this Agreement and (3) the determination of whether the
Separation, the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement have been consummated in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, in each case, shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted
solely in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether
of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing and without limiting _Section_ __ _
10.6(a)_, the Parties hereby further agree that, no Party will bring any
legal proceeding, whether in Law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort
or otherwise, against the Lenders or any Lender Related Party in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Spinco Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if
under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts,
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof).

 

(c) AS A SPECIFICALLY BARGAINED INDUCEMENT FOR EACH OF THE PARTIES TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT (WITH EACH PARTY HAVING HAD OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT
COUNSEL), EACH OF THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ACTION
OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR ANY
OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENT OR THE SPINCO FINANCING, REGARDLESS OF WHICH PARTY
INITIATES SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING, AND ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR ANY OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENT OR THE SPINCO
FINANCING SHALL BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE
SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

 

Section 10.7 _Jurisdiction; Service of Process_. ANY ACTION WITH RESPECT
TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS ARISING HEREUNDER, OR FOR
RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF ANY JUDGMENT IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS ARISING HEREUNDER BROUGHT BY THE OTHER PARTY OR
PARTIES OR THEIR SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNS, IN EACH CASE, SHALL BE BROUGHT AND
DETERMINED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY AND ANY STATE
APPELLATE COURT THEREFROM WITHIN THE STATE OF DELAWARE (OR, IF THE DELAWARE
COURT OF CHANCERY DECLINES TO ACCEPT JURISDICTION OVER A PARTICULAR MATTER,
ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT WITHIN THE STATE OF DELAWARE). EACH OF THE PARTIES
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES AND CONSENTS TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION, SERVICE OF
PROCESS AND VENUE IN THE AFORESAID COURTS AND WAIVES, AND AGREES NOT TO
ASSERT, BY WAY OF MOTION, AS A DEFENSE, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHERWISE, IN ANY
ACTION WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT (I) ANY CLAIM THAT IS NOT PERSONALLY
SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE ABOVE NAMED COURTS FOR ANY REASON OTHER
THAN THE FAILURE TO SERVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS  _SECTION_ __ _ 10.7_,
(II) ANY CLAIM THAT IT OR ITS PROPERTY IS EXEMPT OR IMMUNE FROM JURISDICTION
OF ANY SUCH COURT OR FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS COMMENCED IN SUCH COURTS (WHETHER
THROUGH SERVICE OF NOTICE, ATTACHMENT PRIOR TO JUDGMENT, ATTACHMENT IN AID OF
EXECUTION OF JUDGMENT, EXECUTION OF JUDGMENT OR OTHERWISE) AND (III) TO THE
FULLEST

 



99  EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY CLAIM THAT (A) THE ACTION IN SUCH
COURT IS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM, (B) THE VENUE OF SUCH ACTION IS
IMPROPER OR (C) THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, MAY NOT BE
ENFORCED IN OR BY SUCH COURTS. THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE THAT MAILING OF
PROCESS OR OTHER PAPERS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN
THE MANNER PROVIDED IN  _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ OR IN SUCH OTHER MANNER AS MAY
BE PERMITTED BY LAW, SHALL BE VALID AND SUFFICIENT SERVICE THEREOF AND HEREBY
WAIVE ANY OBJECTIONS TO SERVICE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE MANNER HEREIN PROVIDED.

 

Section 10.8 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be
declared judicially to be invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision shall
not have the effect of invalidating or voiding the remainder of this
Agreement, it being the intent and agreement of the Parties that this
Agreement shall be deemed amended by modifying such provision to the extent
necessary to render it valid, legal and enforceable to the maximum extent
permitted while preserving its intent or, if such modification is not
possible, by substituting therefor another provision that is valid, legal and
enforceable and that achieves the original intent of the Parties.

 

Section 10.9 _Headings_. The headings and captions of the Articles and
Sections used in this Agreement and the table of contents to this Agreement
are for reference and convenience purposes of the Parties only, and will be
given no substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever.

 

Section 10.10 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at
any time before or after receipt of the Merger Sub Stockholder Approval and
the Voyager Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that after such
stockholder approvals there shall not be made any amendment that by Law
requires further approval by the holder of Merger Sub Common Stock or the
Voyager Stockholders without the further approval of such stockholders. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this  _Section_
__ _ 10.10_, _Section_ __ _ 10.3_, _Section_ __ _ 10.6_, and _Section_ __ _
10.17_ (and any related definitions insofar as they affect such Sections) may
not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in a manner
adverse to the Lenders, in each case, without the prior written consent of the
Lenders.

 

Section 10.11 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, the Parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso
of the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 10.1_, waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the
part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. No failure
or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of
any rights or remedies provided by applicable Law.

Section 10.12 _Interpretation_.

 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section,
Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article, Section, Exhibit
or Schedule of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of
contents to this Agreement, and the Article and Section headings contained in
this Agreement, are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,

 



100  they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when
used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. The definitions contained in this
Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such
terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of
such terms and any reference to the masculine, feminine or neuter gender shall
be deemed to include any gender or all three as appropriate. Unless otherwise
specified, any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein
or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such
agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver
or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor
statutes, and including all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated
therein. References to a person are also to its permitted successors and
assigns. Unless expressly stated to the contrary in this Agreement or in any
other Transaction Agreement, all references to "the date hereof," "the date of
this Agreement," "hereby" and "hereupon" and words of similar import shall
all be references to April 20, 2018 (or the date of which the relevant
Transaction Agreement is first entered into, as the case may be) regardless of
any amendment or restatement hereof (or thereof). The use of the phrase
"ordinary course of business" or other derivations thereof shall mean
"ordinary course of business consistent with past practice." Unless the
context otherwise requires, "or," "neither," "nor," "any," "either," and "or"
shall not be exclusive. Wherever and whenever in this Agreement there is a
consent right of a Party or a reference to the "satisfaction" or "sole
discretion" of a Party, such Party shall be entitled to consider solely its
own interests (and not the interests of any other Person) or, at its sole
election, any such other interests and factors as such Party desires. The
Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement, and in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this
Agreement.

 

(b) Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific fact
or item in the Harbor/Spinco Disclosure Schedules or the Voyager Disclosure
Schedules is intended or will be deemed to imply that such amount, or higher
or lower amounts, or the fact or item so included or other facts or items,
are or are not material. Unless this Agreement specifically provides
otherwise, neither the specification of any fact, item or matter in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific fact, item or matter in the Harbor/Spinco Disclosure Schedules
or the Voyager Disclosure Schedules is intended or will be deemed to imply
that such fact, item or matter, or other facts, items or matters, are or are
not in the ordinary course of business. The inclusion of any fact or item in
the Harbor/Spinco Disclosure Schedules or the Voyager Disclosure Schedules
shall not constitute, or be deemed to be, an admission by any Party to any
third party of any fact, item or matter whatsoever (including any violation,
noncompliance with, or Liability or obligation under, applicable Law, other
requirement or breach of Contract). Certain facts, items and matters disclosed
in the Harbor/Spinco Disclosure Schedules and the Voyager
Disclosure Schedules have been disclosed for informational purposes only. No
general disclosure in any particular Section in the Harbor/Spinco Disclosure
Schedules or the Voyager Disclosure Schedules shall be limited by any more
specific disclosure in either that particular Section or any other Section of
the Harbor/Spinco Disclosure Schedules or the Voyager Disclosure Schedules,
respectively, unless a contrary intention is expressly stated.

 

Section 10.13 _Specific Performance_. In the event of any actual or
threatened default in, or breach of, any of the terms, conditions and
provisions of this Agreement or any Transaction Agreement, the Party who is,
or is to be, thereby aggrieved will have the right to specific performance and
injunctive or other equitable relief in respect of its rights under this
Agreement or such Transaction Agreement, in addition to any and all other
rights and remedies at law or in equity. The Parties agree that the remedies
at law for any breach or threatened breach, including monetary damages, are
inadequate compensation for

 



101  any loss and that any defense in any action for specific performance that a
remedy at law would be adequate is waived. Any requirements for the securing
or posting of any bond with such remedy are waived by each of the Parties.

Section 10.14 _Damages Waiver_. No Party or the Voyager Stockholders
Representative shall be liable to another Party or any of its Affiliates (or
any of their respective Related Parties) for any exemplary damages or punitive
damages, or any other damages to the extent not reasonably
foreseeable, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any
Transaction Agreement (in each case, unless any such damages are payable to a
third party pursuant to a Third-Party Claim (as such term is defined in the
Distribution Agreement)).

Section 10.15 _Reference to Time_. All references in this Agreement
to times of the day shall be to New York City time.

Section 10.16 _No Representations or Warranties_.

 

(a) EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS SET FORTH IN _ARTICLE V_ , EACH OF
HARBOR (ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES), SPINCO (ON BEHALF OF
ITSELF AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES) AND MERGER SUB ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NONE OF VOYAGER
OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES MAKES ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY HEREIN AS TO ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR TITLE. EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR HEREIN OR IN ANY OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING THE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT), EACH OF HARBOR (ON BEHALF OF
ITSELF AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES), SPINCO (ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS
SUBSIDIARIES) AND MERGER SUB FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ALL OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES THAT VOYAGER OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES GAVE OR
MIGHT HAVE GIVEN, OR WHICH MIGHT BE PROVIDED OR IMPLIED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
COMMERCIAL PRACTICE, ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED, AND THAT NEITHER HARBOR
NOR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES NOR SPINCO NOR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES NOR MERGER
SUB HAS RELIED ON ANY SUCH REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY. NOTHING IN THIS
PARAGRAPH SHALL OPERATE TO LIMIT A CLAIM FOR FRAUD.

(b) EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS SET FORTH IN  _ARTICLE IV_ , EACH OF
VOYAGER (ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES) AND SPINCO (ON BEHALF OF
ITSELF AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NONE OF HARBOR OR ANY OF ITS
SUBSIDIARIES MAKES ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY HEREIN
AS TO ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR TITLE. EXCEPT TO THE
EXTENT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR HEREIN OR IN ANY OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING THE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT), EACH OF VOYAGER (ON BEHALF OF ITSELF
AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES) AND SPINCO (ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES)
FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES THAT HARBOR
OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES GAVE OR MIGHT HAVE GIVEN, OR WHICH MIGHT BE
PROVIDED OR IMPLIED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR COMMERCIAL PRACTICE, ARE HEREBY
EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED, AND THAT NONE OF VOYAGER OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR
SPINCO OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAS RELIED ON ANY SUCH REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY. NOTHING IN THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL OPERATE TO LIMIT A CLAIM FOR FRAUD.

 



102 Section 10.17 _No Recourse to Lenders_ _._ Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, each of the Parties (on behalf of itself, its
Subsidiaries and the directors, officers, employees, consultants, financial
advisors, accountants, legal counsel, investment bankers, and other agents,
advisors and representatives of each of them) acknowledges and agrees that it
(and such other Persons) shall have no recourse against the Lenders, and the
Lenders shall be subject to no liability or claims by such Party (or such
other Persons) in connection with the Spinco Financing or in any way relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. __
