 (b) _ Repurchase Rights._ If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company, then (i) the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends and (ii) the Per Share Cash Consideration in respect of such shares shall be paid to the holder thereof over time upon satisfaction of the vesting requirements associated with the applicable restricted stock schedule. The Company shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement in accordance with its terms. 

  

 (c) _ Cancellation of Treasury and Parent Owned Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company or Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof. 

  

 (d) _ Capital Stock of Merger Sub._ Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 (f) _ Fractional Shares._ No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holder\'s Certificate(s) (as defined in Section 1.7(c)), receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, less the amount of any withholding taxes as contemplated by Section 1.7(f), which are required to be withheld with respect thereto, equal to the product of: (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average closing sale price of one share of Parent Common Stock for the ten (10) most recent trading days that Parent Common Stock has traded ending on the trading day one day prior to the Effective Time, as reported on The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("Nasdaq"). 

  

 (g) _ Adjustments to Merger Consideration._ The Exchange Ratio and the Per Share Cash Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of (i) any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time and (ii) any declaration, payment or distribution by Parent of any dividend or distribution (whether in cash or other property) in respect of Parent Common Stock having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 

  

  

 1.7 _ Surrender of Certificates._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Exchange Agent._ Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger. 

  

 (b) _ Parent to Provide Merger Consideration._ Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with the Exchange Agent, reasonably satisfactory to the Company, which shall provide that Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article I, the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable and cash payable pursuant to Section 1.6(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. In addition, Parent shall make available as necessary from time to time after the Effective Time as needed, cash in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions which holders of shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(d). Any cash and Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund." 

  

 (c) _ Exchange Procedures._ Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(a), cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with 

  

    
  

such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) the number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates surrendered by
such holder) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6(a), (y)
the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration which such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article I after taking into
account all the shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder under
all such Certificates so surrendered (together with cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 1.6(f)) and (z) any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
Section 1.7(d), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from
and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence the
ownership of the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock into which such
shares of Company Common Stock shall have been so converted, the right to
receive the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration with respect to such
shares of Company Common Stock and the right to receive an amount in cash in
lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with Section
1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d).

  

 (d) _ Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares._ No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date hereof with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holders of record of such Certificates shall surrender such Certificates. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest (i) promptly after such surrender, the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued and amount of Per Share Cash Consideration paid in exchange therefor along with cash payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and the amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. 

   

 (e) _ Transfers of Ownership._ If shares of Parent Common Stock are to be issued in the name of, or Per Share Cash Consideration paid to, a person other than the person in whose name the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the persons requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other Taxes (as defined in Section 2.7) required by reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the name of, or payment of Per Share Cash Consideration to, any person other than the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (f) _ Required Withholding._ Each of the Exchange Agent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement (as defined in Section 2.4(b)). To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, the amount of such consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid. 

  

    
  

 (g) _ No Liability._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.7, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

 (h) _ Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis; _provided_ that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to Company stockholders pursuant to this Article I. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to Company stockholders pursuant to this Article I shall promptly be paid to Parent. 

  

 (i) _ Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates six (6) months after the Effective Time shall, at the request of the Surviving Corporation, be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or otherwise on the instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of the Certificates who have not surrendered such Certificates in compliance with this Section 1.7 shall after such delivery to Surviving Corporation look only to the Surviving Corporation for the shares of Parent Common Stock and amount of Per Share Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(a), cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d) with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 2.4(d)) shall, to the extent permitted by law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

  

  

 1.8 _ Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding Section 1.6, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder of shares of Company Common Stock who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses its rights to appraisal or it is determined that such holder does not have appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL. If after the Effective Time such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses its right to appraisal, or if it is determined that such holder does not have an appraisal right, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive in exchange for each Share the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands except as required by applicable law. The Company shall not, except with prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, unless and to the extent required to do so under applicable law. 

  

 1.9 _ No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All shares of Parent Common Stock issued, all cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.6(f)) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I. 

     

 1.10 _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration, cash for fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Company or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

 1.11 _ Tax Consequences._ It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations, Section 1.368-2(g). 

  

 1.12 _ Further Action._ At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

rights or alter the rights or obligations of any third party under, or give to
others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of,
or result in the creation of a Lien on any of the material properties or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any note, bond,

The Company shall provide Parent as promptly as practicable oral and written notice setting forth all such information as is reasonably necessary to keep Parent informed in all material respects of the status and details (including material amendments or proposed material amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and shall promptly provide to Parent a copy of all written materials subsequently provided in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. 

  

 (ii) The Company shall provide Parent with forty-eight (48) hours prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of its Board of Directors) of any meeting of its Board of Directors at which its Board of Directors is reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal. 

    

 (c) _ Superior Offers._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 4.2(a), in the event that the Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third party that its Board of Directors has in good faith concluded (following the receipt of the advice of its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor), is, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Offer (as defined in Section 4.2(g)), it may then take the following actions (but only if and to the extent that its Board of Directors concludes in good faith, following the receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations under applicable law): 

    

 (i) Furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such Acquisition Proposal, provided that (A) (1) concurrently with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such party, it gives Parent written notice of its intention to furnish nonpublic information and (2) it receives from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and oral information furnished to such third party on its behalf, the terms of which are at least as restrictive as the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 5.3), it being understood that such confidentiality agreement and any related agreements shall not include any provision calling for any exclusive right to negotiate with such party or having the effect of prohibiting the Company from satisfying its obligations hereunder and (B) contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such third party, it furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously so furnished), together with a complete list identifying all nonpublic information furnished to such third party; and 

   

 (ii) Engage in negotiations with the third party with respect to the Acquisition Proposal, provided that concurrently with entering into negotiations with such third party, it gives Parent written notice of its intention to enter into negotiations with such third party.

 (i) A Superior Offer with respect to the Company has been made and has not been withdrawn; 

  

 (ii) The Company Stockholders\' Meeting has not occurred; 

  

 (iii) The Company shall have (A) delivered to Parent written notice (a "Change of Recommendation Notice") at least three (3) business days prior to publicly effecting such Change of Recommendation, which notice shall state expressly (1) that it has received a Superior Offer, (2) the material terms and conditions of the Superior Offer and the identity of the person or group making the Superior Offer, and (3) that it intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and the manner in which it intends (or may intend) to do so, (B) provided to Parent a copy of all written materials delivered to the person or group making the Superior Offer in connection with such Superior Offer, and (C) made available to Parent all materials and information made available to the person or group making the Superior Offer in connection with such Superior Offer, together with a complete list identifying all such materials and information furnished to such person or group; and 

  

 (iv) The Company Board of Directors has concluded in good faith, after receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer, the failure of the Company Board of Directors to effect a Change of Recommendation is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under applicable law. 

   

  

After delivering the Change of Recommendation Notice, the Company shall
provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to make such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, and negotiate in good faith with respect
thereto, as would enable the Company to proceed with its recommendation to
stockholders without making a Change of Recommendation.

  

  

 (e) _ Continuing Obligation to Call, Hold and Convene Company Stockholders\' Meeting; No Other Vote._  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the obligation of the Company to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders\' Meeting shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to it of any Acquisition Proposal, or by any Change of Recommendation. The Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal, or propose to do so. 

  

 (f) _ Compliance with Tender Offer Rules._ Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ that the content of any such disclosure thereunder shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing proviso, the Company shall not effect a Change of Recommendation unless specifically permitted pursuant to the terms of Section 4.2(d).

 (c) _ Notification._ Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will notify the other promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any comments from any officials of any Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto and (ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental Entity for amendments or supplements to any filings made pursuant to, or information provided to comply in all material respects with, any Legal Requirements. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to Section 5.6(a), Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, will promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement. 

  

 (d) _ Reasonable Efforts._ Subject to the express provisions of Section 4.2 and Section 5.2 hereof and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, each of the parties agrees to use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, including using all reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all reasonable acts necessary to cause the conditions precedent set forth in Article VI to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii) the defending of any suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, if, there is a reasonable possibility that the defending of such actions would result in their dismissal, removal, elimination or termination, and (iv) the execution or delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. Parent and the Company shall discuss, in good faith, procedures to pursue third party consents and each shall use all reasonable efforts to pursue obtaining those consents (it being understood that failure to obtain any one or more such consents shall not give rise to a failure of a condition to Closing hereunder).

 (e) _ Limitation on Divestiture and Litigation._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to (i) litigate or agree to litigate against any Governmental Entity at any time following the termination of this Agreement or (ii) take or agree to take any Action of Divestiture (as defined below) which would be reasonably likely either to materially and adversely impact the benefits expected to be derived by Parent as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby or to have a material adverse impact on the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted or as contemplated to be conducted on a combined basis with the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries following the Merger. For purposes 

  

    
  

of this Agreement, an "Action of Divestiture" shall mean (i) making
proposals, executing or carrying out agreements or submitting to
Legal Requirements providing for the license, sale or other disposition or
holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any
assets or categories of assets that are material to Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or the holding separate of Company
capital stock or imposing or seeking to impose any limitation on the ability
of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, to conduct
their respective businesses or own such assets or to acquire, hold or exercise
full rights of ownership of the Company\'s business or (ii) otherwise taking
any step to avoid or eliminate any impediment which may be asserted under any
Legal Requirement governing competition, monopolies or restrictive trade
practices.

 5.8 _ Company Option Plans; Employee Stock Purchase Plan._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Assumption of Stock Options._ Unless Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree otherwise, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that effective as of the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Option," and collectively, the "Company Options") granted under the Company\'s 1998 Stock Plan (including the UK and French Sub Plans thereto), Cadabra Inc. 1998 Stock Option Plan, Auctionrover.com, Inc. 1999 Stock Award Plan and Auctionrover.com, Inc. 1999 Executive Stock Award Plan (collectively, the "Enumerated Option Plans"), and any other stock option plan, program or agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (together with the Enumerated Option Plans, each, an "Option Plan" and collectively, the "Option Plans") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall be assumed by Parent as of the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, each such Company Option shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into an option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock in an amount, at an exercise price and subject to such terms and conditions determined as provided below. Each Company Option so assumed by Parent shall be subject to, and exercisable and vested upon, the same terms and conditions as under the applicable Option Plan and the applicable option and other related agreements issued thereunder, except that (A) each assumed Company Option shall be exercisable for, and represent the right to acquire, that number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company 

  

    

Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Option
Exchange Ratio; and (B) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock
subject to each assumed Company Option shall be an amount equal to (i) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (ii) the
Option Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). If and to the
extent necessary or required by the terms of the Option Plans or pursuant to
the terms of any Company Option granted thereunder, the Company shall use all
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of each holder of outstanding Company
Options to effectuate the foregoing assumption of such Company Options.
The Company agrees that each of the Option Plans and related agreements shall
be amended, to the extent necessary, to reflect the transactions contemplated
herein. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall take all such steps as may
be required to provide that, with respect to each Section 16 Person (as
defined below), (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii)
any other dispositions of the Company\'s equity securities (including
derivative securities) or other acquisitions of Parent\'s equity securities
(including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement, shall be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with
the terms and conditions set forth in that certain No-Action Letter, dated
January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom
LLP. For purposes of this Agreement, "Section 16 Person" shall mean each
individual who (x) immediately prior to the Effective Time is a director or
officer of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16 of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or (y) at the Effective Time will
become a director or officer of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16 of the
Exchange Act with respect to Parent. "Option Exchange Ratio" shall mean the
quotient of (i) the sum of (A) the Per Share Cash Consideration and (B) the
product of the Exchange Ratio and the Parent Market Price, and (ii) the
Parent Market Price. "Parent Market Price" shall mean the average closing sale
price of one share of Parent Common Stock for the five (5) most recent
trading days that Parent Common Stock has traded ending on the trading day one
day prior to the Effective Time, as reported on Nasdaq.

  

 (b) _ Incentive Stock Options._ The conversion of Company Options provided for in Section 5.8(a), with respect to any options which are intended to be "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be effected in a manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. 

  

 (c) _ Termination of the Company\'s Employee Stock Purchase Plan._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board of Directors shall (i) pursuant to Section 19 of the Company\'s 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), shorten the Offering Period (as defined in the ESPP) then in progress by setting a new Exercise Date (as defined in the ESPP) that is prior to the Effective Time (the "New Exercise Date") and notifying all participants in the ESPP of such New Exercise Date at least ten (10) business days prior to the New Exercise Date, and that each participant\'s option under the ESPP shall be exercised automatically on the New Exercise Date, unless prior to such date such participant has withdrawn from the Offering Period, and (ii) take all steps necessary to terminate the ESPP prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) _ Service Credit._ Following the Effective Time, Parent will use all reasonable efforts to give each Continuing Employee (as defined below) credit for prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of (i) eligibility and vesting under any applicable Parent benefit plan or written policy or arrangement ("Parent Benefit Plan") in which such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate at or following the Effective Time and (ii) determination of benefits levels under any vacation or severance Parent Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate at or following the Effective Time; _provided_ that in each case under clauses (i) and (ii) above, if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries maintains a comparable 

  

    
  

Company Employee Plan, service shall be credited solely to the extent that
such service was or would have been credited for such purposes under such
comparable plans. Parent shall give credit under those of its applicable
Parent Benefit Plans that are welfare benefit plans and in which Continuing
Employees become eligible to participate at or following the Effective Time,
for all co-payments made, amounts credited toward deductibles and out-of-
pocket maximums, and time accrued against applicable waiting periods, by
Continuing Employees (including their eligible dependents), in respect of the
plan year in which the Effective Time occurs. Parent shall waive all
requirements for evidence of insurability and pre-existing conditions
otherwise applicable to the Continuing Employees under the Parent Benefit
Plans in which the Continuing Employees become eligible to participate at or
following the Effective Time, but if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
maintains a comparable Company Employee Plan, solely to the extent such
requirements and conditions were not applicable to the particular Continuing
Employee under such comparable Company Employee Plan. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Continuing Employees" shall mean those employees of Parent and
employees of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time who shall
have been employees of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

 (e) _ Employee Communications._ With respect to matters described in Section 5.8, the Company will use all reasonable efforts to consult with Parent (and consider in good faith the advice of Parent) prior to sending any notices or other communication materials to its employees. 

  

 (f) _ 401(k) Plan._ If requested by Parent, the Company shall terminate the Company 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan (the "Company 401(k) Savings Plan") prior to the Effective Time, and each Continuing Employee who is a participant in the Company 401(k) Savings Plan shall have the right to elect to receive a distribution of all or a portion of such employee\'s account balance in the Company 401(k) Savings Plan (subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of the plan and applicable law). 

  

  

 5.9 _ Form S-8._ Parent agrees to file with the SEC as soon as practicable but no later than twenty (20) business days following the Effective Time a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act covering, to the extent applicable, the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued upon the exercise of Company Options assumed by Parent. 

  

 5.10 _ Nasdaq Listing._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent agrees to use all reasonable efforts to authorize for listing on Nasdaq, the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable, and those required to be reserved for issuance, in connection with the Merger, subject to official notice of issuance. Parent agrees to promptly make such other additional filings with Nasdaq as may be required in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 5.11 _ Company Rights Plan._ The Company shall not redeem the Company Rights or amend or modify (including by delay of the "Distribution Date" thereunder) or terminate the Company Rights Plan prior to the Effective Time unless, and only to the extent that: (a) it is required to do so by order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (b) its Board of Directors has concluded in good faith, after receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that, the failure to effect such amendment, modification or termination is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its Board of Directors\' fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under applicable law. 

  

 5.12 _ Consents of Accountants._ Parent and the Company will each use all reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to each other consents from their respective independent auditors, in form reasonably satisfactory to the recipient and customary in scope and substance for consents delivered by independent public accountants in connection with registration statements on Form S-4 under the Securities Act. 

     

 5.13 _ Subsequent Financial Statements._ The Company shall, if practicable, consult with Parent prior to making publicly available its financial results for any period after the date of this Agreement and prior to filing any Company SEC Documents after the date of this Agreement, it being understood that Parent shall have no liability by reason of such consultation. 

   

 5.14 _ Conveyance Taxes._ Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration or other fees or any similar taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective Time. 

  

 5.15 _ Indemnification._ 

  

  

 (a) Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements previously disclosed to Parent between the Company and its directors, officers, employees and agents as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties") and any indemnification provisions under Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof. The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company, unless such modification is required by law. 

  

 (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to use its all reasonable efforts to maintain in effect, if available, directors\' and officers\' liability insurance covering those persons who are currently covered by the Company\'s directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy on terms comparable to those applicable to the current directors and officers of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in excess of one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage (the "Current Annual Premium Amount"), and to the extent the annual premium would exceed one hundred fifty (150%) of the Current Annual Premium Amount, the Surviving Corporation shall use all reasonable efforts to be maintained the maximum amount of coverage available for such one hundred fifty percent (150%) of such Current Annual Premium Amount. The Current Annual Premium Amount is set forth in Section 5.15 of the Company Disclosure Letter. 

   

 (c) This Section 5.15 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent and the Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and assigns. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their respective successors and assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successor and assign of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall honor the obligations set forth with respect to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, in this Section 5.15. 

  

  

 5.16 _ Treatment as Reorganization._ None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall, and they shall not permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, take any action prior to or following the Closing which would reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

       

  5.17 _ Merger Sub Compliance._ Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to comply with all of Merger Sub\'s obligations under or relating to this
Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not engage in any
business which is not in connection with the merger with and into the Company
pursuant to this Agreement.

or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial
ownership of shares representing in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the
voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company.

This Agreement may not be amended except by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company. 

   

 7.5 _ Extension; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective Time any party hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed: (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein.

 8.3 _ Interpretation; Certain Defined Terms._ 

  

  

 (a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Exhibits, such reference shall be to an Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. When reference is made herein to "the business of" an entity, such reference shall be deemed to include the business of all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such entity. 

  

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "affiliates" (other than when preceded immediately by the word "commercial") shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 

  

 (c) For purposes of this Agreement, whenever under the terms hereof the giving of a notice or performance of an act takes place after 12:00 noon California time, (i) the beginning of any period required for giving such notice or performing such act shall be deemed to be the next full day or, if the period is measured in business days, the next full business day, rather than the day of such notice or performance, and (ii) the expiration of such required period shall be deemed to be 5:00 p.m. California time on the last day or, if the period is measured in business days, last business day, of the period. By way of example, if a notice is required three (3) business days in advance and the notice is delivered at 10:00 a.m. California time on a Friday which is a business 

  

    
  

day, then the expiration of the period shall be 5:00 p.m. on the following
Tuesday, assuming that both Monday and Tuesday are business days.

  

 (d) For purposes of this Agreement, "Commercial Affiliate" shall mean any third party through whom the Company distributes its search results or otherwise receives search listing traffic in exchange for payments.

 (g) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Knowledge" means with respect to the Company, with respect to any matter in question, the actual knowledge that any of the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Operating Officer of the Company or the person identified on Section 8.3(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter has and the actual knowledge that each of the Chief Financial Officer or General Counsel of the Company has after inquiry of his respective direct reports. 

  

 (h) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" when used in connection with an entity, means any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or effect (any such item, an "Effect"), individually or when taken together with all other Effects that have occurred during the applicable measurement period prior to the date of determination of the occurrence of the Material Adverse Effect, that is reasonably likely to (i) be materially adverse to the business, assets (including intangible assets), capitalization, financial condition or results of operations of such entity taken as a whole with its Subsidiaries, or (ii) materially impede the authority of such entity to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof and applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that for purposes of clause (i) above, in no event shall any of the following be taken into account in determining whether there has been or will be, a Material Adverse Effect on any entity: (A) any Effect resulting from compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (B) any Effect resulting from the announcement or pendency of the Merger ( _provided_ , that the exception in this clause (B) shall not apply to the use of the term "Material Adverse Effect" in Sections 6.2(a) and 6.3(a) with respect to the representations and warranties contained in Sections 2.4(b)(i), 2.4(b)(ii), 3.2(b)(i) and 3.2(b)(ii)), including, in the case of the Company, any material loss of or adverse change in its relationship with any key employees, suppliers, customers or Commercial Affiliates or any failure to keep intact or renew the Commercial Affiliate Agreements, (C) any change in such entity\'s stock price or trading volume, in and of itself, (D) any Effect that results from changes affecting the industry in which such entity operates generally or the United States economy generally (which changes in each case do not disproportionately affect such entity in any material respect), (E) any Effect that results from changes affecting general worldwide economic or capital market conditions (which changes in each case do not disproportionately affect such entity in any material respect), (F) stockholder class action, derivative or similar litigation arising from 

  

    
  

allegations of a breach of fiduciary duty or misrepresentation in public
disclosure relating to this Agreement, or (G) any failure by such entity to
meet published revenue or earnings projections, which failure shall have

Reference to the Subsidiaries of an entity shall be deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such entity. 

  

  

 8.4 _ Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, and by facsimile, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

  

 8.5 _ Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and (b) are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder, except as specifically provided in Section 5.15. 

  

 8.6 _ Severability._ In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision. 

  

 8.7 _ Other Remedies; Specific Performance._ Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  

 8.8 _ Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable 

     

principles of conflicts of law thereof. In addition, each of the parties
hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any
Delaware state court in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it
will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than a state court sitting
in the State of Delaware.

   

 8.9 _ Rules of Construction._ The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. 

  

 8.10 _ Assignment._ This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to (i) Parent, (ii) to Parent and one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent incorporated as corporations in the State of Delaware, or (iii) to one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent incorporated as corporations in the State of Delaware (each, an "Assignee"); _provided_ that such Assignee shall in each case be substituted for Merger Sub with respect to, and bound by, each of the representations, warranties and covenants of Merger Sub contained herein. Any such Assignee may thereafter assign, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more additional Assignees. Subject to the preceding sentence, but without relieving any party hereto of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 8.11 _ No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative._ No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder will impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor will any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available. 

  

 8.12 _ Waiver of Jury Trial._ EACH OF PARENT, THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, THE COMPANY OR MERGER SUB IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
