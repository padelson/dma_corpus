jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a CIM
Material Adverse Effect.

5.3 _CIM Merger Sub_. All of the outstanding equity interests in CIM Merger
Sub are owned directly by CIM, free and clear of all Liens and, except as set
forth on _Schedule 5.3_ , transfer restrictions, voting agreements or other
agreements with respect to the ownership, voting, control, or other transfer

requisite limited liability company power and authority to enter into this

Agreement by each of CIM and CIM Merger Sub do not, and the consummation of
the Transactions to which it is a party and compliance by CIM and CIM Merger
Sub with the provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result

acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of
CIM, CIM Merger Sub or any CIM Subsidiary under, or give rise to any
increased, additional, accelerated, or guaranteed rights or entitlements under

assets, other than, in the case of clause (b) or (c), any such conflicts,
violations, defaults, rights or Liens that individually or in the aggregate
would not reasonably be expected to (i) have a CIM Material Adverse Effect or
(ii) prevent the consummation of the Transactions.

5.5  _Consents_. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, any federal, state or local
government or any court, administrative or regulatory agency or commission or

(a) _Schedule 5.6_ contains a true and complete copy of the following
financial statements: (a) audited consolidated financial statements of the
CIM Partnership and its Subsidiaries (including the balance sheet and the
related statements of income and cash flow) as of and for each of the 12-month
periods ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012, respectively, together
with all related notes and schedules thereto, accompanied by the reports
thereon of CIMs independent auditors (collectively, the " _CIM Year-End
Financial Statements_ "); and (ii) unaudited consolidated
financial statements of the CIM Partnership and its Subsidiaries (including

and for the three month period ended March 31, 2013 (the " _CIM Interim
Financial Statements_ " and, together with the CIM Year-End Financial
Statements, the " _CIM Financial Statements_ "). The CIM Financial Statements
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly
presented in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable
requirements of GAAP, the financial position of the CIM Partnership and its
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the results of operations and cash
flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of the CIM Interim
Financial Statements, to normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments).

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.6_ or as permitted by _Section
7.1_ (for the purposes of this sentence, as if _Section 7.1_ had been in
effect since December 31, 2012), neither the CIM Partnership nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any material liabilities or obligations of any nature
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be
set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of the CIM Partnership or, to the
knowledge of CIM, of any unconsolidated Subsidiary of the CIM Partnership or
in the notes thereto other than any such liabilities or obligations incurred
since December 31, 2012 in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice of the CIM Partnership and its Subsidiaries. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _knowledge_ " (and derivation terms thereof) with
respect to CIM shall mean the actual knowledge of those Persons set forth on
_Schedule 5.6_ and shall include the actual knowledge of such Persons gained
through their participation in the business and operations of CIM, the CIM
Partnership and the CIM Subsidiaries.

knowledge of CIM, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or
representative of CIM, the CIM Partnership or any party providing accounting

Subsidiary, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of CIM, the CIM Partnership or any CIM Subsidiary or its respective
internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim that CIM, the CIM Partnership or any CIM Subsidiary has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices. 

(d) The CIM Partnership (or CIM GP on behalf of CIM Partnership) has
established and maintains a system of internal control over financial
reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of CIM Partnerships financial reporting and the preparation of the CIM
Partnerships financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP. To the knowledge of CIM, there is not (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of CIM GPs or
the CIM Partnerships internal control over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the CIM Partnerships ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the CIM Partnerships internal control over
financial reporting.

5.7 _Binding Effect_. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by,
and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of, enforceable against each of
CIM and CIM Merger Sub in accordance with its terms as such enforceability may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
conveyance or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether such
enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 



7 5.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as disclosed on  _Schedule
5.8_, since December 31, 2012 and to the date of this Agreement, CIM, the CIM
Partnership and its Subsidiaries have conducted their business only in the

effect that individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a CIM Material Adverse Effect (a " _CIM Material Adverse

passage of time would reasonably be expected to result in a CIM Material
Adverse Change, (b) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend
or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) with respect to any
equity interests in the CIM Partnership outside the ordinary course of
business or as permitted under _Section 7.1_, (c) any issuance or
authorization of any issuance of any other equity or ownership interest in the

giving the right to acquire by exchange or exercise, of its equity interests
or any issuance of an ownership interest in, any CIM Subsidiary except as
permitted by _Section 7.1_, (d) any material damage, destruction or loss,
not covered by insurance, or (e) any change in accounting methods, principles
or practices by the CIM Partnership or any of its CIM Subsidiaries, except as

validity or enforceability of this Agreement of any of the other Transaction
Documents or prevent the consummation of any of the Transactions, nor is there

CIM Partnership and the CIM Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (ii) neither the

the knowledge of CIM, no present or former director, executive officer,
stockholder, partner, member, employee, or Affiliate of CIM, the CIM GP, the

liabilities or obligations expected to be incurred. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 5.12(b)_, the execution of, and performance of the Transactions
in, this Agreement will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under any CIM Benefit
Plan, policy, arrangement or agreement or any trust or loan that will or may
result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration,
forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or
obligation to fund benefits with respect to any employee or director. The only
severance agreements or severance policies applicable to the CIM Partnership
or its Subsidiaries are the agreements and policies specifically referred to

and the number of CIM Properties currently managed by each such party. To
CIMs knowledge, the CIM Properties are not subject to any rights of way,

occupancy, or reservations of an interest on title (collectively, " _Property
Restrictions_ "), except for (i) Liens and Property Restrictions set forth on
_Schedule 5.13_, (ii) Property Restrictions imposed or promulgated by law or
any Governmental Entity with respect to real property, including zoning

of any CIM Property (e.g., if a property is currently used for residential
purposes, the current zoning does not materially adversely affect the use of
such property for residential purposes), (iii) Liens and Property Restrictions
disclosed on existing title reports or existing surveys (in either case copies
of which have been delivered or made available to Trust) and (iv) mechanics,
carriers, workmens, repairmens liens and other Liens, Property Restrictions
and other limitations of any kind, if any, which, individually or in the
aggregate, are not substantial in amount, do not materially detract from the
value of or materially interfere with the present use of any of the CIM
Properties subject thereto or affected thereby, and do not otherwise have a
CIM Material Adverse Effect and which have arisen or been incurred only in
the ordinary course of business. Except as provided on _Schedule 5.13_ or as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the ownership and continued use or operation of any
of the CIM Properties, (i) CIM has no knowledge that any certificate, permit
or license from any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over any of the
CIM Properties or any agreement, easement or other right which is necessary to
permit the lawful use and operation of the buildings and improvements on any
of the CIM Properties or which is necessary to permit the lawful use and
operation of all driveways, roads and other means of egress and ingress to and
from any of the CIM Properties has not been obtained and is not in full force
and effect, or of any pending threat of modification or cancellation of any of
same and (ii) CIM Partnership has not received written notice of any violation
of any federal, state or municipal law, ordinance, order, regulation or
requirement affecting any portion of any of the CIM Properties issued by any
Governmental Entity. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ownership and
continued use or operation of any of the CIM Properties, neither CIM
Partnership nor any of the CIM Subsidiaries has received written notice to the
effect that (A) any condemnation or rezoning proceedings are pending or
threatened with respect to any of the CIM Properties or (B) any zoning,
building or similar law, code, ordinance, order or regulation is or will be
violated by the continued maintenance, operation or use of any buildings or
other improvements on any of the CIM Properties or by the continued
maintenance, operation or use of the parking areas.

5.14 _Taxes_.

 

(a) Except as disclosed on Schedule 5.14 or as would not have a CIM Material
Adverse Effect, each of the CIM Partnership and its Subsidiaries has (i)
timely filed all Tax returns and reports required to be filed by it (after
giving effect to any filing extension properly granted by a Governmental
Entity having authority to do so) and all such returns and reports
are accurate and complete in all material respects and (ii) timely paid (or
the CIM

 



10  Partnership has paid on its behalf) all Taxes shown on such returns and
reports as required to be paid by it, and the CIM Partnership Year-End
Financial Statements reflect an adequate reserve for all material Taxes
payable by the CIM Partnership (and by those Subsidiaries of the CIM
Partnership whose financial statements are contained therein) for all taxable
periods and portions thereof through the date of such financial statements.
True, correct and complete copies of all federal, state and local Tax returns
and reports for the CIM Partnership and each Subsidiary of the CIM Partnership
for all taxable years for which the statutory periods of limitation have not
yet expired, and all written communications relating thereto with any
Governmental Entity, have been delivered or made available to representatives
of Trust. Except as disclosed on _Schedule 5.14_, neither the CIM Partnership
nor any Subsidiary has incurred any liability for taxes under Sections
856(c)(7), 857, 860 or 4981 of the Code, and neither the CIM Partnership nor
any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any material liability for Taxes other
than in the ordinary course of business. To the knowledge of CIM, no event
has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists, which presents a
material risk that any material Tax described in the preceding sentence will
be imposed upon the CIM Partnership or any CIM Subsidiary, other than
CIM Subsidiaries which are taxable REIT subsidiaries as defined under Section
856(l) of the Code. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.14_, to the knowledge
of CIM, no deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed, asserted or
assessed against the CIM Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries, and no
requests for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes are pending. CIM
Merger Sub is, and since its formation has been a disregarded entity for
federal income tax purposes. As used in this Agreement, " _Taxes_ " shall
include all federal, state, local and foreign income, franchise, property,
sales, employment, withholding, excise and other taxes, tariffs or
governmental charges of any nature whatsoever, together with penalties,
interest or additions to Tax with respect thereto.

(b) Each of the Subsidiaries of the CIM Partnership designated as a REIT on
Schedule 5.2 (each such Subsidiary, a "REIT Subsidiary") (i)(A) is, and since
its election, has been taxable as, a REIT, and is, and since its election has
been, entitled to the benefits available under the provisions of Part II of
Subchapter M of the Code, and (B) has paid dividends during each of its
taxable years for which the statute of limitations has not expired in an
amount sufficient to satisfy Section 857(a)(1)(A) of the Code and reduce its
excise tax liabilities to zero for such years, (ii) has operated in such a
manner that it would qualify as a REIT for the taxable year ending on the
Closing Date if, hypothetically, its taxable year ended on the Closing Date,
and (iii) has not taken or omitted to take any action which would reasonably
be expected to result in a challenge to its status as a REIT by the Internal
Revenue Service, and to CIMs knowledge, no such challenge is pending or
threatened. The CIM Partnership and each Subsidiary of the CIM Partnership
(other than a REIT Subsidiary) which is a partnership, joint venture or
limited liability company (that has not joined with CIM or such REIT
Subsidiary in making an election to be a taxable REIT subsidiary in
accordance with Section 856(l) of the Code) since its formation has been and
continues to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partnership or a
disregarded entity and not as a corporation or an association taxable as a
corporation.

5.15 _No Payments to Employees, Officers or Directors_. Except as set forth
on  _Schedule 5.15_ or as otherwise specifically provided for in this
Agreement, there is no employment or severance contract, or other agreement
requiring payments to be made or increasing any amounts payable thereunder on
a change of control or otherwise as a result of the consummation of any of
the Transactions, with respect to any employee, officer or director of the CIM
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries.

5.16 _Brokers; Schedule of Fees and Expenses_. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other person is or may be entitled to any brokers,
finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in
connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of CIM or any CIM Subsidiary.

5.17 _Compliance with Laws_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.17_, neither
CIM Partnership nor any of the CIM Subsidiaries has violated or failed to
comply with any Laws applicable to its business, properties or operations,
except for violations and failures to comply that would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a CIM Material Adverse
Effect.

Contracts of the CIM Partnership and the CIM Subsidiaries (such Contracts as
described in this _Section 5.18_ being the " _CIM Material Contracts_ "):

terminable without penalty on thirty (30) days notice by the CIM Partnership

effect on the business, properties, assets, financial condition or results of
operations of Trust and the Trust Subsidiaries taken as a whole but excluding
therefrom any such change, effect, event, occurrence or state of facts
resulting from or arising in connection with (a) changes or conditions
generally affecting the industries in which Trust operates, (b) this

6.13 _Loans_.

(a) All loans and other extensions of credit (including commitments to extend
credit) by Trust and its Subsidiaries (each a " _Loan_ ") are and were
originated in compliance with all Laws applicable to such Loans, except for
failures to comply that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expect to result in a Trust Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Each outstanding Loan was solicited and originated, and is and has been
administered and, where applicable serviced, and relevant loan files are being
maintained, in all material respects in accordance with the relevant notes or
other credit or security documents, the underwriting standards of Trust and
its Subsidiaries and with all applicable requirements of Law.

(c) Schedule 6.13 identifies (A) each Loan that, as of May 31, 2013, was
contractually past due thirty (30) days or more in the payment of principal
and/or interest, (B) each Loan that, as of March 31, 2013, (i) was classified
as "OAEM," "substandard," "doubtful," or "special mention" (or words of
similar import) by Trust, any of its Subsidiaries or the rules of any
applicable regulatory authority, (ii) was on non-accrual status, (iii)
where the interest rate terms had been reduced and/or the maturity dates had
been extended subsequent to the agreement under which such Loan was originally
created due to concerns regarding the borrowers ability to pay in accordance
with such initial terms, (iv) where a specific reserve allocation existed in
connection therewith or (v) which was required to be accounted for as a
troubled debt restructuring in accordance with ASC 310, and (C) each asset of
Trust or any of its Subsidiaries that, as of March 31, 2013 was classified as
other real estate owned or as an asset to satisfy Loans. For each Loan
identified in response to clause (A) above, _Schedule 6.13_ sets forth the
outstanding balance, including accrued and unpaid interest, on each such Loan
and the identity of the borrower thereunder as of May 31, 2013, and for each
Loan identified in response to clause (B) above, _Schedule 6.13_ sets forth
the outstanding balance, including accrued and unpaid interest, on each such
Loan and the identity of the borrower thereunder as of March 31, 2013.

 

(d) To the knowledge of Trust, each outstanding Loan (i) is evidenced by
notes, agreements or other evidences of indebtedness that are true, genuine
and what they purport to be, (ii) to the extent secured, has been secured by
valid Liens which have been perfected and (iii) is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its
terms as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general equitable
principles (regardless of whether such enforcement is sought in a proceeding
in equity or at law).

 



19 (e) Trust originates loans directly and indirectly through the following
Subsidiaries: First Western SBLC, Inc. (" _First Western_ "); PMC Investment
Corporation (" _PMCIC_ "); and Western Financial Corporation (" _Western
Financial_ "). First Western is licensed as a small business lending
company (" _SBLC_ ") that originates loans through the SBAs 7(a) Guaranteed
Loan Program (" _SBA 7(a) Program_ ") and has been granted Preferred Lender
Program (" _PLP_ ") status by the SBA. PMCIC and Western Financial are
licensed as small business investment companies (" _SBICs_ "). Except as
provided on _Schedule 6.13_ , (i) neither Trust nor any of its Subsidiaries
has knowledge to the effect that (A) First Westerns SBLC license or PLP
status may not continue in full force and effect for any reason, (B) any
guarantees by the SBA of Loans under the SBA 7(a) Program may be rejected or
(C) PMCICs or Western Financials SBIC license may not continue in full
force and effect for any reason. Neither Trust nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received written notice from any Governmental Entity that could impact its
ability to continue to originate Loans as currently conducted.

 

(f) Trusts allowance for Loan losses is, and shall be as of the Effective
Time, determined in compliance in all material respects with Trusts
methodology for determining its allowance for Loan losses and, to Trusts
knowledge, is adequate as provided under the standards established by
applicable Governmental Entities and the Financial Accounting Standards
Board. 

6.14 _Taxes_.

(a) Except as disclosed on Schedule 6.14 or as would not have a Trust Material
Adverse Effect, each of Trust and each Trust Subsidiary has (i) timely filed
all Tax returns and reports required to be filed by it (after giving effect
to any filing extension properly granted by a Governmental Entity having
authority to do so) and all such returns and reports are accurate and complete
in all material respects and (ii) timely paid (or Trust has paid on its
behalf) all Taxes shown on such returns and reports as required to be paid by
it, and the most recent financial statements contained in the Trust SEC
Documents reflect an adequate reserve for all material Taxes payable by
Trust (and by those Trust Subsidiaries whose financial statements are
contained therein) for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the
date of such financial statements. True, correct and complete copies of all
federal, state and local Tax returns and reports for Trust and each Trust
Subsidiary for all taxable years for which the statutory periods of limitation
have not yet expired, and all written communications relating thereto with any
Governmental Entity, have been delivered or made available to representatives
of CIM. Except as disclosed on _Schedule 6.14_ , Trust has incurred no
liability for taxes under Sections 856(c)(7), 857, 860 or 4981 of the Code,
and neither Trust nor any Trust Subsidiary has incurred any material
liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of business. To the
knowledge of Trust, no event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance
exists, which presents a material risk that any material Tax described in the
preceding sentence will be imposed upon Trust or any Trust Subsidiary. Except
as set forth on _Schedule 6.14_, to the knowledge of Trust, no deficiencies
for any Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against Trust or any of
the Trust Subsidiaries, and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any
such Taxes are pending.

(b) Trust (i)(A) is, and since its election has been taxable as, a REIT, and
is, and since its election has been, entitled to the benefits available under
the provisions of Part II of Subchapter M of the Code, and (B) has paid
dividends during each of its taxable years for which the statute of
limitations has not expired in amounts sufficient to satisfy Section
857(a)(i)(A) of the Code and reduce its excise tax liabilities to zero for
such years, (ii) has operated in such a manner that it would qualify as a
REIT for the taxable year ending on the Closing Date if, hypothetically, its
taxable year ended on the Closing Date and (iii) has not taken or omitted to
take any action which would reasonably be expected to result in a challenge
to its status as a REIT by the Internal Revenue Service, and to Trusts
knowledge, no such challenge is pending or threatened. Each Trust Subsidiary
which is a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company (that has
not joined with Trust in making an election to be a taxable REIT subsidiary
in accordance with Section 856(l) of the Code) since its formation has been
and continues to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partnership
or a disregarded entity and not as a corporation or an association taxable as
a corporation.

forth on _Schedule 6.15_ or as otherwise specifically provided for in this
Agreement, there is no employment or severance contract, or other agreement
requiring payments to be made or increasing any amounts payable thereunder on

Trust nor any of the Trust Subsidiaries has violated or failed to comply with

aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Trust Material Adverse
Effect.

its reasonable best efforts to obtain resignations, effective as of the
Effective Time, from each manager and officer of Trust listed on _Schedule
8.9_ and to appoint as managers and officers of Trust the Persons listed on

8.10 _Acquisition Proposals; Go Shop Period; Intervening Event_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until
11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on August 6, 2013 (the " _Go Shop Period_ "), Trust
and the Trust Subsidiaries and their respective directors, managers,
officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
advisors or representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") shall have
the right to: (i) initiate, solicit and encourage any inquiry or the making
of any proposals or offers that constitute Acquisition Proposals, including by
way of providing access to non-public information to any Person pursuant to
confidentiality agreements on customary terms not materially more favorable
in the aggregate to such Person than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement; provided that Trust shall promptly (and in any event within forty-
eight (48) hours thereafter) make available to CIM any material non-public
information concerning Trust or the Trust Subsidiaries if such information was
not previously made available to CIM, and (ii) engage or enter into or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Persons or
groups of Persons with respect to any Acquisition Proposals or otherwise
cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any such inquiries,
proposals, discussions or negotiations or any effort or attempt to make any
Acquisition Proposals.

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 8.10_ (including 
_Section 8.10(c)_), Trust and the Trust Subsidiaries and their respective
officers, managers and directors shall, and Trust shall cause its and the
Trust Subsidiaries other Representatives to, (i) at 12:01 a.m. on the

relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, (C) enter into any agreement or
agreement in principle with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or (D)
otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition
Proposal.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to the time, but not after, the Trust Shareholder Approvals are
obtained, if Trust receives a written Acquisition Proposal from any Person
that did not result from a breach of _Section 8.10(b_), subject to compliance
with this _Section 8.10(c)_, (i) Trust and its Representatives may provide
non-public information and data concerning Trust and the Trust Subsidiaries in
response to a request therefor by such Person if Trust receives from such
Person an executed confidentiality agreement on customary terms
not materially more favorable in the aggregate to such Person than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that Trust shall promptly
(and in any event within

 



27  forty-eight (48) hours thereafter) make available to CIM any material non-
public information concerning Trust or the Trust Subsidiaries if such
information was not previously made available to CIM and (ii) Trust and its
Representatives may engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations
with such Person, in each of (i) and (ii), if and only to the extent that, (x)
prior to taking any action described in clause (i) or (ii) above, the Board
of Trust Managers of Trust or any committee thereof determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, and (y) in each such case referred to in clause
(i) or (ii) above, the Board of Trust Managers of Trust or any committee
thereof has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal.

 

(d) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer with respect to (x)
a merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction with any
Person or group of Persons that involves Trust or any of the Trust
Subsidiaries or (y) any acquisition (whether by tender offer, share exchange
or other manner) by any Person or group of Persons which, in each case of (x)
and (y), if consummated would result in any Person or group of Persons
becoming the beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in one or a series
of related transactions, equity securities of the Trust or any of the Trust
Subsidiaries representing more than 20% of all outstanding equity securities
of Trust (by vote or value), or more than 20% of the consolidated total assets
(including, equity securities of the Trust Subsidiaries) of the Trust and the
Trust Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each case other than the
Transactions. 

(ii) " _Business Day_ " means any day ending at 11:59 p.m. (New York local
time) other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which commercial banks in
the City of New York are required or authorized by law or executive order to
close.

(iii) " _Intervening Event_ " means a material event or circumstance relating
to the business, results of operations, assets or financial condition of Trust
and Trusts Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that occurs or arises after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement (other than a Superior Proposal) and
was not known to the Board of Trust Managers of Trust on the date of this
Agreement, which event or circumstance becomes known to the Board of Trust
Managers of Trust prior to the time at which Trust receives the Trust
Shareholder Approvals.

(iv) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
(provided, that for purpose of this definition, the percentages in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be seventy five percent (75%) rather
than twenty percent (20%)) made by a third party that did not result from a
breach of this _Section 8.10_ for a transaction that is on terms that the
Board of Trust Managers of Trust determines, in good faith after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, to be more favorable
from a financial point of view to the holders of Trust Common Shares than the
Transactions (including the Closing Dividend), taking into account all the
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement
(including any offer by CIM to amend the terms of this Agreement) that are
deemed relevant by the Board of Trust Managers of Trust, and taking into
account all legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of such
Acquisition Proposal including the financing thereof, and the Person making
the Acquisition Proposal.

(e)  _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_.
Except as set forth in this _Section 8.10(e)_, _Section 8.10(f)_ or _Section
10.3(a)_, the Board of Trust Managers of Trust and each committee thereof
shall not:

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to CIM, the Trust
Recommendation with respect to the Transactions or approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, or resolve to approve or recommend,
any Acquisition Proposal; or

 

(ii) except as expressly permitted by _Section 10.3(a)_, cause or permit
Trust to enter into any letter of intent, Alternative Acquisition Agreement
or other similar agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to
in _Section 8.10(a)_ or _Section 8.10(c)_, relating to any Acquisition
Proposal.

 



28 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time, but not after, the Trust Shareholder Approvals are obtained, the
Board of Trust Managers of Trust and any committee thereof may withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify the Trust Recommendation if the Board of Trust
Managers of Trust or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to do so would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law
(a " _Change of Recommendation_ ") and may also terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)_ (a " _Fiduciary Termination_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, Trust shall not effect a Change of Recommendation in
connection with a Superior Proposal or effect a Fiduciary Termination
pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)_ with respect to a Superior Proposal without
satisfying the following conditions: (x) Trust notifies CIM in writing, at
least five (5) Business Days in advance, that it intends to effect a Change
of Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal or effect a Fiduciary
Termination pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)_ with respect to a Superior
Proposal, which notice shall specify the identity of the party who made such
Superior Proposal and all of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal and attach the most current version of such agreement; (y)
after providing such notice and prior to making such Change of Recommendation
in connection with a Superior Proposal or effecting a Fiduciary Termination
pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)_ with respect to a Superior Proposal, Trust
shall negotiate in good faith with CIM during such five (5) Business Day
period (to the extent that CIM desires to negotiate) to make such revisions
to the terms of this Agreement as would permit the Board of Trust Managers of
Trust not to effect a Change of a Recommendation in connection with a Superior
Proposal or not to effect a Fiduciary Termination pursuant to _Section
10.3(a)_ in response to a Superior Proposal; and (z) the Board of Trust
Managers of Trust shall have considered in good faith any changes to this
Agreement offered in writing by CIM in a manner that would form a binding
contract, if accepted by Trust, and shall have determined in good faith that
the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such
changes offered in writing by CIM were to be given effect;  _provided_ that,
in the event that the Acquisition Proposal to which this provision applies is
thereafter modified in any respect by the party making such Acquisition
Proposal, Trust shall provide written notice of such modified
Acquisition Proposal to CIM and shall again comply with this _Section
8.10(e)_ and provide CIM with an additional three (3) Business Days notice
prior to effecting any Change in Recommendation or effecting a Fiduciary
Termination pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)_ (and shall do so for each such
subsequent modification).

(f) Nothing contained in this  _Section 8.10_ shall be deemed to prohibit
Trust or the Board of Trust Managers of Trust or any committee thereof from
(i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders), or (ii) making
any "stop look and listen" communication to the shareholders of Trust pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to the shareholders of Trust); provided that the foregoing
shall in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any such disclosure would
otherwise have under this Agreement. 

(g) From and after the date thereof, Trust agrees that (i) it will promptly
(and, in any event, within forty-eight (48) hours) notify CIM if (x) any
Acquisition Proposal is received by it or any Trust Subsidiary or any of its
Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of
the Person making the Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and
conditions thereof (including, if applicable, copies of any written
documentation constituting the Acquisition Proposal, including proposed
agreements) and (y) any non-public information is requested from, or any
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated with, it or any of its
Representatives in connection with a potential Acquisition Proposal,
indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of the Person seeking
such information or discussions or negotiations, and in each case, thereafter
shall keep CIM reasonably informed of the status of any such discussions or
negotiations, and (ii) in the event that any such party materially modifies
its Acquisition Proposal in any respect, Trust shall notify CIM within forty-
eight (48) hours after receipt of such modified Acquisition Proposal of the
fact that such Acquisition Proposal has been modified and the terms of such
modification (including, if applicable, copies of any written documentation
reflecting such modification). Trust agrees it shall not, and shall cause the
Trust Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement subsequent
to the date hereof which prohibits Trust from providing to CIM such
material terms and conditions and other information.

 



29 (h) Except as set forth in this _Section 8.10(h_), the Board of Trust
Managers of Trust and each committee thereof shall not effect a Change in
Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event unless the Board of Trust
Managers of Trust has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided, however, that Trust shall not effect such a Change of Recommendation
with respect to an Intervening Event unless: (x) Trust notifies CIM in
writing, at least five (5) Business Days in advance, that it intends to effect
such a Change of Recommendation, which notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the nature of the Intervening Event; (y) after providing such notice
and prior to making such a Change of Recommendation, Trust shall negotiate in
good faith with CIM during such five (5) Business Day period (to the extent
that CIM desires to negotiate) to make such revisions to the terms of this
Agreement as would permit the Board of Trust Managers of Trust not to effect a
Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event; and (z) the
Board of Trust Managers of Trust shall have considered in good faith any
changes to this Agreement offered in writing by CIM, and shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that it
would continue to be inconsistent with the Board of Trust Managers fiduciary
duties under applicable Law not to effect the Change of Recommendation if
such changes offered in writing by CIM were given effect.

8.11 _Public Announcements_. None of the Parties shall issue any press
release or make any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions without the prior written consent of the other Parties (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as permitted by _Section
8.10_ of this Agreement or as may be required by applicable Law or the
applicable rules of the NYSE or other applicable national securities exchange,
court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange. The parties agree that the initial press release
to be issued with respect to the Transactions will be issued immediately
following the execution of this Agreement and will be in the form agreed to
by the parties hereto prior to the execution of this Agreement.

8.12 _Listing_. Trust will promptly prepare and submit to a national
securities exchange mutually acceptable to Trust and CIM a listing application
covering the Trust Common Shares and Trust Preferred Shares (including the
Trust Common Shares and Trust Preferred Shares issuable in the Merger and all
Trust Common Shares issuable upon conversion of the Trust Preferred Shares).
Prior to the Effective Time, Trust shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to have such national securities exchange approve for listing, upon official
notice of issuance, the Trust Common Shares and Trust Preferred Shares
(including the Trust Common Shares and Trust Preferred Shares to be issued in
the Merger and all Trust Common Shares issuable upon conversion of the Trust
Preferred Shares).

 

8.13 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, Trust shall take such steps as
may be required to cause the Trust Common and Preferred Shares Issuance to be
exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act by reason of Rule 16b-3 under
the Exchange Act.

8.14 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_.

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including any such claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation in
which any Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a manager, director or
officer of Trust or any of the Trust Subsidiaries (each, together with such
Persons heirs, executors and administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and
collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a
party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was a manager, director or
officer of Trust or any of Trust Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the
request of Trust or any of Trust Subsidiaries as a manager, director, officer,
employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (ii) the discussion,
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or any arrangement,
agreement or document contemplated hereby or delivered in connection herewith,
or otherwise directly or indirectly relating to this Agreement or any such
arrangement, agreement or document, or any of the Transactions contemplated

 



30  hereby or thereby or otherwise directly or indirectly relating to this
Agreement or any such other arrangement, agreement or document, whether in any
case asserted or arising at or before or after the Effective Time, Trust
agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to defend against and
respond thereto. It is understood and agreed that Trust shall indemnify and
hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each
Indemnified Party against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, reasonable and documented expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding, inquiry or investigation, and, in the event of any such threatened
or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation (whether
asserted or arising at or before or after the Effective Time), (A) Trust
shall promptly pay the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any such threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, demand, proceeding, inquiry or investigation to each
Indemnified Party upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnified Party if required by Law to repay such amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be
indemnified therefor, (B) the Indemnified Parties may retain one counsel
satisfactory to them (together with one additional counsel for each additional
jurisdiction in which representation is reasonably necessary), and Trust shall
pay all reasonable and documented fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties within twenty (20) days after statements therefor are
received, and (C) Trust will use its reasonable best efforts to assist in the
vigorous defense of any such matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that Trust
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); and _provided further_ that Trust shall have no obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final and non-appealable, that indemnification by such entities of
such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this _Section 8.14_, upon learning of any such threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify
Trust thereof; _provided_ that the failure to so notify shall not affect the
obligations of Trust except to the extent, if any, such failure to promptly
notify materially prejudices such party.

(b) Trust, CIM and Trust Merger Sub each agree that all rights to
indemnification and advancement of expenses existing in favor of, and all
limitations on the personal liability of, each Indemnified Party provided for
in _Section 8.14(a_) above or in the respective declarations of trust,
charter or bylaws (or other applicable organizational documents) of Trust and
the Trust Subsidiaries or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof (including
through any agreement or arrangement between Trust or any Trust Subsidiary, on
the one hand, and any manager, director, officer, employee or agent of Trust
or any Trust Subsidiary, on the other hand) shall survive the Transactions and
continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and limitations on personal liability in respect of
any claims (each, a " _Claim_ ") asserted or made within such period shall
continue until the final disposition of such Claim. From and after the
Effective Time, Trust and each Trust Subsidiary also agree to jointly and
severally indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers,
directors and managers of Trust and the Trust Subsidiaries in respect of acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and, with respect
to acts or omissions occurring after the Effective Time, such acts or
omissions that directly or indirectly relate back to acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time) to the extent provided in any
written indemnification agreements between Trust and/or one or more Trust
Subsidiaries and such officers, directors and managers.

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Trust shall, at
no cost to the beneficiaries thereunder, cause to be maintained in effect the
current policies of managers, directors and officers and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by Trust (provided that Trust may substitute
therefor policies with reputable and financially sound carriers of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no
less advantageous) with respect to claims directly or indirectly arising from
or related to facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time;
provided that in no event shall Trust be required to expend annually in the
aggregate an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid
by Trust as of the date of this Agreement for such insurance (the " _Insurance
Amount_ "); provided, further, that if Trust is unable to maintain such policy
(or such substitute policy) as a result of the preceding proviso, Trust shall
obtain

 



31  as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount;
provided, further, that, in lieu of the foregoing insurance, at any time after
the date hereof, Trust, may purchase a managers, directors and officers
and fiduciary liability insurance "tail" or "runoff" insurance program for a
period of six (6) years after the Effective Time with respect to wrongful acts
and/or omissions committed or allegedly committed at or prior to the
Effective Time (such coverage shall have an aggregate coverage limit over the
term of such policy in an amount not less than the annual aggregate coverage
limit under Trusts existing managers, directors and officers liability
policy, and in all other respects shall be comparable to such existing
coverage); and provided, further, that if the annual premiums for such "tail"
policy exceed the Insurance Amount, then Trust may obtain a "tail" policy
with the maximum coverage available for the Insurance Amount applied over the
term of such policy.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations under this _Section 8.14_ shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this
_Section 8.14_ applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified
Party. This _Section 8.14_ is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to
grant third party beneficiary rights to, the Indemnified Parties and their
respective heirs and shall be binding on all successors of the Parties hereto.
Each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs shall be entitled
to enforce the provisions of this _Section 8.14_. 

(e) In the event that, following the Effective Time, Trust or any Trust
Subsidiary or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into or converts into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
(ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person or (iii) commences a dissolution, liquidation, assignment
for the benefit of creditors or similar action, then, and in each such case,
to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Trust or any Trust Subsidiary, as the case may
be, assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 8.14_.

8.15 _Employee Matters_.

(a) On and after the Effective Time, Trust shall honor in accordance with
their terms all employment agreements listed on _Schedule 6.18(e)_ and all
Trust Benefit Plans listed on _Schedule 6.12(a)_ ; provided that nothing
herein shall be construed as prohibiting the amendment or termination of any
of the foregoing in accordance with their terms.

(b) Subject to _Section 8.15(h)_, for no less than the twelve (12)-month
period immediately following the Closing Date, each employee of Trust and its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time shall continue to be employed by Trust
(collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") and shall continue to provide
to such Continuing Employees compensation and employee benefits that are
substantially comparable in value in the aggregate as those provided as of the
date of this Agreement by Trust and its Subsidiaries to such
Continuing Employee (excluding, for purposes of currently provided benefits,
any equity or equity-based compensation, defined benefit pension benefits,
retiree medical benefits or transaction or retention bonuses). Trust may only
increase an employees compensation between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing Date in strict accordance with documented past practices and in
the ordinary course of business. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Closing
Date occurs prior to December 31, 2013, (i) Trust shall continue to sponsor
through at least December 31, 2013 the Trust Benefit Plans, (ii) permit the
Continuing Employees and, as applicable, their eligible dependents, to
participate in the Trust Benefit Plans (including without limitation any plan
intended to qualify within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code and any
vacation, sick, per personal time off plans or programs) on terms no less
favorable than those provided to the Continuing Employees prior to the date
of this Agreement.

(c) CIM shall, and it shall cause its Affiliates (including, for periods on
or after January 1, 2014, Management Company) to, cause each of its employee
benefit plans providing benefits to any Continuing Employees to give each
Continuing Employee full credit (for all purposes, including eligibility to
participate, vesting, vacation entitlement and severance benefits) for all
service with Trust or its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date to the same
extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to
credit for such service under any similar Trust Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Closing; provided, however, that (i) such service need not be 

 



32  credited to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits, and
(ii) such service credit shall not be given with respect to benefit accruals
under any defined benefit pension plan or plans providing for post-
termination medical benefits.

(d) Following the Closing Date, with respect to the Continuing Employees and
their eligible dependents, CIM shall, and it shall cause its Affiliates to,
cause each of its employee benefit plans providing benefits to any Continuing
Employee to: (i) waive any pre-existing conditions to the extent such pre-
existing conditions were waived under the existing plans of Trust as of the
date of this Agreement, (ii) provide credit for prior service with Trust and
its Affiliates as of the Closing Date for purposes of satisfying any
applicable waiting periods to the extent such credit would be recognized for
its purpose under the existing plans of Trust as of the date of this
Agreement, and (iii) give credit in the year in which the Closing Date occurs
for any copayments, deductibles and out-of-pocket limits paid by the
continuing Employee and eligible dependents in such year prior to the Closing
Date to the extent such amounts would be recognized for such purposes under
the existing plans of Trust as of the date of this Agreement. 

(e) If the Closing Date occurs prior to December 31, 2013, Trust shall pay to
each Continuing Employee an annual bonus payment due to such Continuing
Employee under Trusts 2013 annual bonus plan, to the extent such payments
were not previously paid to the Continuing Employees pursuant to such bonus
plans terms. Not later than January 15, 2014, Trust shall fund an employer
profit sharing contribution to the PMC Commercial Trust 401(k) Plan for the
plan year ending December 31, 2013 for at least the same funding level,
determined as a percentage of annual compensation, as was funded for the plan
year ending December 31, 2012.

(f) Nothing in this _Section 8.15_, whether express or implied, shall confer
upon any Person whether or not a party to this Agreement (including any
Continuing Employee) any right to employment or recall, any right to continued
employment, any right to compensation or benefits, or any other right of any
kind or nature whatsoever.

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 8.15_, express or implied is intended
to confer upon any Person any rights as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement.

(h) The provisions of this _Section 8.15_ shall not be applicable to any
employee terminated for cause. For purposes of this _Section 8.15_, "cause"
shall mean an employees: (i) conviction of, or plea of nolo contendere to,
any felony or involving acts of theft, fraud, embezzlement, moral turpitude,
or similar conduct, (ii) intoxication by alcohol or drugs during the
performance of such Continuing Employees duties in a manner that adversely
affects the Continuing Employees performance of such duties; (iii)
malfeasance, in the conduct of such Continuing Employees duties, including,
but not limited to, (A) misuse or diversion of funds of Trust or its
Subsidiaries, (B) stealing, (C) misrepresentations or concealments regarding
hours worked or on any written reports submitted to Trust or its Subsidiaries,
including expense reimbursement requests, or (D) engaging in inappropriate
workplace behavior such as gross insubordination, fighting, harassment or
discrimination; or (iv) excessive absenteeism or tardiness that is not
otherwise protected by law.

8.16  _[Intentionally Deleted]_.

8.17 _Trust Board Nomination Committee Procedures_. Prior to the Effective
Time, Trust shall take such actions as may be necessary so that, as of the
Effective Time, (a) the number of trust managers that will comprise the Board
of Trust Managers of Trust shall be seven trust managers, consisting of three
independent managers (the " _Independent Managers_ ") and four non-
Independent Managers and (b) the Board of Trust Managers of Trust (and
committees thereof) set forth on _Schedule 2.1_ shall have been properly
evaluated and approved by Trusts Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee (or CIM shall be advised otherwise and shall be entitled to nominate
substitute candidate(s)) so that they may commence to serve effective as of
the Effective Time.

 

8.18 _Subsequent Proxy Statement_.

(a) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, CIM agrees to cause
Trust, and Trust agrees to file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement
pursuant to which Trust shall solicit proxies from Trusts

 



33  shareholders to vote in favor of an increase of the authorized number of
Trust Common Shares to 1,000,000,000 shares and a change in the name of Trust
to "CIM Commercial REIT" through an amendment to the Declaration of Trust or
reincorporation of Trust from Texas to Maryland (the _"Subsequent Proxy
Statement_ "). Each of CIM and Trust agree to use their respective reasonable
best efforts to have the Subsequent Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as
promptly as practical. As soon as practical following its clearance by the
SEC, Trust shall distribute the Subsequent Proxy Statement to Trusts
shareholders to solicit proxies in favor of the matters contained in the
Subsequent Proxy Statement.

(b) CIM agrees to cause Trust, and Trust agrees to duly call, give notice of
and convene a meeting of Trusts shareholders for the purpose of obtaining the
approval of Trusts shareholders of the matters set forth in the Subsequent
Proxy Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Date. CIM agrees to cause Trust, and Trust agrees through its then Board of

the case of the Confidentiality Agreement, subject to the terms thereof).

(i) (x) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ (in the
case of _Section 10.2(a)_ only, before obtaining the Trust Shareholder
Approvals), _Section 10.2(b)_, or _Section 10.4(b)_ (as a result of any

to an Acquisition Proposal or consummated an Acquisition Proposal (provided
that for purposes of this clause (z) the references to "20%" in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to
"50%");

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by CIM pursuant to _Section 10.4(a)_; or

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Trust pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)_;
then Trust shall:

 

(A) in the case of clause (i) above, promptly, but in no event later than
three (3) Business Days after the date on which Trust consummates the
Acquisition Proposal referred to in subclause (i)(z) above, pay CIM the
Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds; provided,
however, the portion of the Termination Fee representing the Expense
Reimbursement is payable within the later of the aforesaid three (3) Business
Day Period and two Business Days after receipt from CIM of an invoice
therefor; and

 

(B) in the case of clause (ii) and (iii) above, immediately prior to or

(c) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
10.5_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these

38  accordingly, if Trust fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to
_Section 10.5(b_), and, in order to obtain such payment, CIM commences a suit
that results in a judgment against Trust for the amount set forth in _Section
10.5(b_) or any portion thereof, Trust shall pay to the CIM its reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at
the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made through the date of payment. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement but subject to  _Section 11.7(c)_, in
circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable, CIMs right to receive

be the sole and exclusive remedy of CIM against Trust for the loss suffered
for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise.

10.6 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties in writing by
action of the Director of CIM or the Board of Trust Managers of Trust at any
time before or after the Trust Shareholder Approvals are obtained and prior to

Shareholder Approvals are obtained, no such amendment, modification or
supplement shall be made which by Law requires further approval by the
Shareholders of Trust without obtaining such approval.

may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other Party contained in this Agreement

the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The
failure of any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement
(including failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in
order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other

obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

11.9 _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in _Schedule 11.9_ is defined

11.10 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any current or future law, and if the
rights or obligations of the parties under this Agreement would not be
materially and adversely affected thereby, such provision shall be fully
separable, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part
thereof, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision or by its severance therefrom. In lieu of such illegal, invalid or

 



41  unenforceable provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of
this Agreement, a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms
to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible, and
the parties hereto request the court or any arbitrator to whom disputes
relating to this Agreement are submitted to reform the otherwise illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision in accordance with this  _Section 11.10_.

11.11 _Schedules_. CIM and CIM Merger Sub shall not be entitled to claim that
any fact or combination of facts constitutes an inaccuracy in, or a breach
of, any of the representations or warranties contained in Article VI of this
Agreement if and to the extent that such fact or combination of facts has been
disclosed in the Trust SEC Documents filed with or furnished to the SEC after
December 31, 2011 and prior to the date of this Agreement in sufficient detail
to reasonably put CIM and CIM Merger Sub on notice of the relevance of the
facts or circumstances so disclosed, but excluding any risk factor disclosure
set forth under the caption "Risk Factors" (or a similarly phrased caption) in
any such Trust SEC Documents that would similarly apply to most other
companies conducting business activities that are the same or similar to
those conducted by Trust. Any fact or combination of facts that has been
disclosed in any Schedule of the Schedules shall be deemed to be disclosed
with respect to any other Section of this Agreement to the extent that it
is reasonably apparent that such disclosure is applicable to such other
Section and Schedule. The inclusion of any information in the Schedules shall
not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgement, in and of itself, that
such information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is
material, has resulted or is reasonably expected to result in a CIM Material
Adverse Effect or a Trust Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or is
outside the ordinary course of business or that it would otherwise be
