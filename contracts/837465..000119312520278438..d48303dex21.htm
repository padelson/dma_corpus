at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of securities of
Acquiror, Merger Sub or the Company:

 

(a) (i) each share of Company Preferred Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares and
the Dissenting Shares), shall thereupon be converted into the right to
receive, and the holder of such share of Company Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive, the Per Share Preferred Stock Consideration as if the
Merger were a Deemed Liquidation Event (as defined in the Company Certificate
of Incorporation) and (ii) each share of Company Common Stock that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the
Cancelled Shares and the Dissenting Shares), shall thereupon be converted
into the right to receive, and the holder of such share of Company Common
Stock shall be entitled to receive, the Per Share Common Stock Consideration.
Following the conversion of the shares of Company Preferred Stock into the
right to receive the Per Share Preferred Stock Consideration and the
conversion of the shares of the Company Common Stock into the right to receive
the Per Share Common Stock Consideration pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
3.01(a)_, all of the shares of Company Preferred Stock and

 



32

    

 Company Common Stock so converted shall no longer be outstanding and shall
cease to exist, and each Company Stockholder shall thereafter cease to have
any rights with respect to such securities, except the right to receive the
Per Share Preferred Stock Consideration or the Per Share Common Stock
Consideration, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Acquiror to issue
any number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock (with each such share valued at

Time (clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" collectively, the " _Cancelled Shares_ "),

Stock or shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, or a record
date with respect to any such event shall have occurred, then any number,
value (including dollar value) or amount contained herein which is based upon
the number of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock or
shares of Acquiror Common Stock will be appropriately adjusted to provide to
the holders of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock and the holders
of Acquiror Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section_ __ _ 3.02_ shall not

agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At or prior to

the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Acquiror Common Stock issuable in book-
entry form equal to the applicable portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration payable through the Exchange Agent hereunder (excluding any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of

 



33

    

 Acquiror Common Stock), and (ii) cash in immediately available funds in an
amount sufficient to pay any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Acquiror
Common Stock in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 3.07_ (such evidence of
book-entry shares of Acquiror Common Stock and such cash amounts, the "
_Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole benefit of the Company
Stockholders (other than holders of any Dissenting Shares or Cancelled
Shares). In addition, Acquiror shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with
the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time at or after the Closing
cash in immediately available funds in an amount to pay any cash dividends or
distributions payable in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.03(c)_. Acquiror
shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make,
delivery of the applicable portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration
payable through the Exchange Agent hereunder, including payment of any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.07_ and cash dividends or distributions payable
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.03(c)_, out of the Exchange Fund in
accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion
of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably
directed by Acquiror; _provided_ , that (i) no investment of such cash shall
have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to
this Agreement and (ii) such investments in all events shall be in short-term
obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30
days, or guaranteed by, and backed by the full faith and credit of, the United
States of America. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Acquiror. No investment losses resulting from
investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any former holder
of Company Stock to receive cash payments contemplated by this _Article_ __ _
III_. To the extent, for any reason, the amount in the Exchange Fund is below
that required to make prompt payment of the aggregate cash payments
contemplated by this  _Article_ __ _ III_, Acquiror shall, upon becoming
aware of such deficiency, promptly replace, restore or supplement the cash in
the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to make the payment
of the aggregate cash payments contemplated by _Article_ __ _ III_.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (and in no event later than three Business Days following the
Closing Date), Acquiror shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of shares of Company Stock that were converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.01(a)_ into the right to receive shares of Acquiror Common Stock (i) with
respect to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Stock (each, a " _Company Certificate_ " and, collectively, the "
_Company Certificates_ "), a letter of transmittal in substantially the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit H_ (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Company Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent and
(ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for payment of the shares
of Acquiror Common Stock into which such shares of Company Stock have been
converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)_, including any cash amount
payable in respect of fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.07_ and any cash dividends or distributions
payable in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.03(c)_. Upon surrender of
a Company Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such Letter of Transmittal
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be

 



34

    

 reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, such holder shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) that number of whole shares of
Acquiror Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form)
representing the Per Share Common Stock Consideration and the Per Share
Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable, into which such shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, have been
converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a);_ (B) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.07_ for each share of Company Stock
formerly represented by such Company Certificate and (C) any cash dividends or
distributions payable in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.03(c)_, and the
Company Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) so surrendered
shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Company
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect
an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If
any payment in respect of a surrendered Company Certificate is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Company Certificate
is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (x) the
Company Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer (if applicable) and (y) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment being made to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Company Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of Acquiror or the Exchange Agent
that such Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. The approval
of this Agreement by the requisite vote or written consent of holders of
Company Stock required by the Company Certificate of Incorporation and
applicable Law shall also be deemed to constitute approval of all
arrangements relating to the Transactions and to the provisions hereof binding
upon the Company Stockholders, including the releases, waivers and other
provisions of the Letter of Transmittal. 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting_. All shares of
Acquiror Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Transactions shall be
deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend
or other distribution is declared by Acquiror in respect of the Acquiror
Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective
Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other distribution in
respect of all shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable pursuant to this
Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of the Acquiror
Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Company
Certificate until such Company Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
the Company Certificate as provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.04_) is surrendered
for exchange in accordance with this  _Article_ __ _ III_. Subject to the
effect of applicable Laws, following the surrender of any such Company
Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Company Certificate as
provided in  _Section_ __ _ 3.04_), there shall be issued and/or paid to the
holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date at or
after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares
of Acquiror Common Stock and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole
shares of Acquiror Common Stock with a record date at or after the Effective
Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

 

(d) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. At
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and

 



35

    

 thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company
Stock on the records of the Company. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 3.03_, each Company Certificate shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable
portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)_, any cash amount payable in respect of
fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.07_ and any cash dividends or distributions payable in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 3.03(c)_. If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates
are presented to Acquiror for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Agreement. The delivery of the Per Share
Preferred Stock Consideration shall be made as if the Merger were a Deemed
Liquidation Event (as defined in the Company Certificate of Incorporation) and
pursuant to the Consideration Spreadsheet in accordance with _Section_ __ _
6.07_. An illustrative calculation of the allocation of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration is set forth on _Schedule 3.03_.

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains unclaimed by the Company Stockholders 12 months following
the Closing Date shall, at any time thereafter at the request of Acquiror, be
delivered to Acquiror or as otherwise instructed by Acquiror, and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look only to Acquiror (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect
to the applicable portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, including
any cash amount payable in respect of fractional shares of Acquiror Common
Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.07_ and any cash dividends or
distributions payable in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 3.03(c)_, payable
upon due surrender of their Company Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.04_) and compliance with the
procedures in  _Section_ __ _ 3.03(b)_, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Acquiror, the Company, the
Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Company
Stockholder or any other Person for any portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration or other amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

3.05 _Conversion of Company Equity Awards; Treatment of Company Warrant_.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the
following:

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option, to the
extent then outstanding and unexercised and that is held by an individual
who, at the Effective Time, is providing services to the Company or its
Subsidiaries as an employee or independent contractor, or is a director who is
or will be appointed to the Acquiror Board (each, a " _Rollover Option_ "),
shall automatically, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into an option to acquire Acquiror Common Stock at an adjusted
exercise price per share (as detailed below), subject to the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to such Company Stock Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time, including applicable vesting conditions. Accordingly,
effective as of the Effective Time: (i) each such Rollover Option shall
be exercisable solely for shares of Acquiror Common Stock; (ii) the number of
shares of Acquiror Common Stock subject to each Rollover Option shall be
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to the Company Stock Option by the Company Equity Award Exchange Ratio and
rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Acquiror Common Stock; and (iii) the per share exercise price for the Acquiror
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Rollover Option shall be
determined by dividing the per share exercise price for the shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, by the Company Equity Award Exchange Ratio, and
rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent.

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option that
is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time and
that is not a Rollover Option as defined in _Section_ __ _ 3.05(a)_ (each, a
" _Settled Stock Option_ ") shall automatically, without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a right to receive shares of
Company Common Stock and be deemed exercised for a number of Net Shares (as
defined below), which Net Shares shall be treated as issued and outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)(ii)_. "
_Net Shares_ " means, with respect to each Settled Stock Option, the number of
shares of Company Common Stock, if any, determined by dividing (i) the
product of (A) the excess, if any, of the Cash Equivalent Per Share Common
Stock Consideration over the sum of (1) the per share exercise price of such
Settled Stock Option, plus (2) the total amount any applicable Taxes to be
withheld as a result of the deemed exercise of such Settled Stock Option
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.05(b)_, multiplied by (B) the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Settled Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (ii) the Cash Equivalent
Per Share Common Stock Consideration (rounded down to the nearest whole
share). In the event the exercise price of a Settled Stock Option is greater
than or equal to the Cash Equivalent Per Share Common Stock Consideration,
such Settled Stock Option shall be canceled immediately prior to the Effective
Time for no consideration.

 

(c) Effective as of the Effective Time, each share of Company Restricted
Stock, to the extent then unvested and outstanding, shall automatically,
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be entitled to receive
the Per Share Common Stock Consideration per

 



37

    

 share of Company Restricted Stock, subject to the same terms and conditions
as were applicable to such share of Company Restricted Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time, including applicable vesting conditions.

(d) Effective as of the Effective Time, the Company Warrant shall be assumed
by Acquiror pursuant to the terms of the Warrant Assumption Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the conversions described in this 
_Section_ __ _ 3.05_ will be subject to such modifications, if any, as are
required to cause the conversion to be made in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code and, in the case of any
Company Stock Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise
price and the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of such option shall be determined subject to such adjustments as are
necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.
Following the Effective Time, (i) Acquiror shall assume sponsorship of the
Company Stock Plans, provided that references to the Company therein shall be
deemed references to Acquiror and references to Company Common Stock therein
shall be deemed references to Acquiror Common Stock and (ii) each Company
Equity Award that has been converted in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
3.05_ shall be subject to the same terms and conditions, including any
vesting conditions, as had applied to the corresponding Company Equity Award
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time as described in _Section_ __ _
3.05(a)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 3.05(c)_, except for such terms rendered
inoperative by reason of the Transactions, subject to such adjustments as
reasonably determined by Acquiror to be necessary or appropriate to give
effect to the conversion or the Transactions.

(f) It is the expectation and intent of the parties that the Transactions will
result in the Company experiencing a "change in ownership or control" for
purposes of Section 280G of the Code, and that Acquiror will not experience a
"change in ownership or control" for purposes of Section 280G of the Code. In
the event that Acquiror would reasonably be expected to experience a "change
in ownership or control" for purposes of Section 280G of the Code solely as a
result of the assumption of Rollover Options pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.05(a)_ that are vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time and have an
exercise price equal to or greater than the Per Share Common Stock
Consideration, then such number of Rollover Options as are necessary to ensure
that Acquiror does not experience a "change in ownership or control" for
purposes of Section 280G of the Code shall not be assumed by Acquiror pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 3.05(a)_ and shall instead be cancelled immediately prior
to the Effective Time for no consideration. Rollover Options shall be
cancelled pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.05(f)_ in the reverse order in
which they were granted (for the avoidance of doubt, the Rollover Options
granted most recently will be cancelled first, with such cancellations to be
applied on a pro rata basis to Rollover Options granted on the same grant
date) or in such other order as determined by the Company in its sole
discretion. In the event a Rollover Option is cancelled pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 3.05(f)_, Acquiror shall take all reasonable steps required to
grant to the former holder of such Rollover Options a stock option to purchase
shares of Acquiror Common Stock on substantially the same terms as those
subject to the Rollover Options under an equity plan maintained by Acquiror,
_provided_ that any such replacement grant may be subject to an initial
vesting period of up to six months (or any longer mandatory initial
vesting period required under the terms of Acquirors equity plan, if
applicable) (a " _Replacement Grant_ "). In the event Acquiror or one of its
Affiliates terminates the employment or service of a recipient of a 

 



38

    

 Replacement Grant following the Closing without cause or good reason or due
to the holders death or disability, such holder shall be provided with
accelerated vesting of such Replacement Grant upon any such termination as to
such number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock as is equal to the number of
shares that would have been vested under the cancelled Rollover Option as of
the date of termination had such Rollover Option continued following the
Closing in accordance with its terms.

3.06 _Withholding_. Each of Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Company and their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any amounts otherwise deliverable or payable under this
Agreement such amounts that any such Persons are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to any of the deliveries and payments contemplated by
this Agreement under the Code or any other applicable Law; _provided_ , that
Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Company and their respective
Affiliates, as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide the Company with a written notice of such Persons intention to
withhold at least five Business Days prior to any such withholding and shall
cooperate with the applicable payee to minimize any such withholding. To the
extent that Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Company or their
respective Affiliates withholds such amounts with respect to any Person
(including any applicable Tax withholding arising as a result of the deemed
exercise of any Settled Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time), Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Company or their
respective Affiliates shall properly remit such withheld amounts to the
applicable Governmental Authority, and such withheld amounts shall be treated
as having been paid to or on behalf of such Person for all purposes. In the
case of any such payment payable to employees of the Company or its Affiliates
in connection with the Merger treated as compensation, the parties shall
cooperate to pay such amounts through the Companys or its Subsidiarys
payroll to facilitate applicable withholding.

 

3.07 _Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company
Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.01_, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
holder of Acquiror Common Stock. In lieu of the issuance of any such
fractional share, Acquiror shall pay to each former Company Stockholder who
otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share (after
aggregating all shares of Acquiror Common Stock, including fractional shares,
that would be issued to such Company Stockholder) an amount in cash, without
interest, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (a) the
amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Acquiror Common Stock
to which such holder otherwise would have been entitled but for this _Section_
__ _ 3.07_ multiplied by (b) the Acquiror Trading Price.

 

3.08 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and owned by a Company Stockholder who is entitled to demand
and has properly demanded (and has not effectively withdrawn or lost its right
to) appraisal for such shares in accordance with, and who complies in
all respects with, Section __ 262 of the DGCL (such shares, " _Dissenting
Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Common Stock Consideration or the Per Share Preferred Stock Consideration,
as applicable, and shall instead entitle such Company Stockholder only to
such rights as may be granted to him, her or it under the DGCL. If any such

 



39

    

 Company Stockholder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses
such Company Stockholders right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or
other applicable Law, then such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have
been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable
solely for the right to receive the Per Share Common Stock Consideration or
the Per Share Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable, in accordance
with this _Article_ _III_. The Company shall give Acquiror prompt notice (and
in any event within one Business Day) of any demands received by the Company
for appraisal of shares of Company Stock, attempted withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
the Company relating to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares,
and Acquiror shall have the right to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Acquiror (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), make, propose, enter into, or approve any payment with respect to,
or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demands or
waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or
otherwise comply with the provisions under Section 262 of the DGCL, or agree
or commit to do any of the foregoing.

3.09 _Corporate Governance Matters_. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by
the Company and Acquiror prior to the Closing, and conditioned upon the
occurrence of the Closing, Acquiror shall take all actions (to the extent such
actions are permitted by Law and do not conflict with the terms of the
Stockholders Agreement) reasonably necessary to cause (a) __the number of
directors constituting the Acquiror Board to be such number as is specified on
_Schedule 3.09_ and (b) the individuals set forth on _Schedule 3.09_  (the "
_Company Designated Directors_ ") to be appointed as members of the Acquiror
Board, in each case, effective as of the Closing. Acquiror shall take all
actions reasonably necessary to ensure that each Company Designated
Director that is properly nominated in accordance with the terms of the
Stockholders Agreement (i) __ is included in the slate of nominees
recommended by the Acquiror Board to Acquiror Stockholders for election as
directors at the next annual meeting of Acquiror Stockholders to occur
following the Effective Time and (ii) __is included in the proxy statement
prepared by Acquiror in connection with soliciting proxies at the next annual
meeting of Acquiror Stockholders to occur following the Effective Time, and
at every adjournment or postponement thereof. Each of the Company Designated
Directors shall receive compensation from Acquiror for his or her service as a
director that is consistent with the compensation of other non-employee
members of the Acquiror Board.

_Schedule 4.06(b)_ ; (ii) the Company Preferred Stock; and (iii) the Company
Warrant, there are (A) no subscriptions, calls, options, warrants, rights or

Company Stock Option was granted in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Company Stock Plan and in compliance, in all material respects,
with all applicable Laws. No Company Stock Option is subject to Section 409A
of the Code and each Company Stock Option intended to qualify as
an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies.

(c) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests
of the Companys Significant Subsidiaries: (i) have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable; (ii) were issued in
compliance in all material respects with applicable Securities Law and other

Company Equity Awards, there are (A) no subscriptions, calls, rights or other
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for the equity

properly reflected in the Companys Financial Statements.

(e) Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
Company ERISA Affiliates have sponsored, maintained, contributed to or were
required to contribute to, at any point during the six year period prior to
the date hereof, (i) a multiemployer pension plan (as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA) (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or (ii) other than any Foreign
Company Benefit Plan identified on _Schedule 4.14(k)_ , a defined benefit
pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, in each
case, regardless of whether or not it is subject to Title IV of ERISA. For

considered under common control and treated as a single employer under Section
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code.

Subsidiaries; (ii) increase any compensation or benefits otherwise payable to
any current or former director, officer, employee or independent contractor of

payments or benefits or increases in any existing payments or benefits or any
loan forgiveness, in each case, from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates.

(h) No amount or benefit that will or could be, or has been, received
(whether in cash or property or the vesting of property or the cancellation of
indebtedness or otherwise) by any current or former employee, independent
contractor officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company who is a "disqualified individual" within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code would be characterized or could reasonably be expected to be
characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code) as a result of the consummation of the Transactions
(either alone or in combination with any other event).

 

(i) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be

 Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the
meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code has been operated in all material
respects in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code since January
1, 2005 or its inception (whichever is later), and all applicable regulations
and notices issued thereunder. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, no Company Benefit Plan or award thereunder
provides to any "service provider" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the
Code) of the Company or its Subsidiaries any compensation or benefits which
have been subjected or should have been subject to gross income inclusion or
additional Tax pursuant to Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code. No Company Benefit
Plan or other agreement or arrangement provides for the gross-up of any
Person for any Taxes imposed by Section 4999 or 409A of the Code.

 

(j) No Company Benefit Plan provides welfare benefits, including death or
medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to current or former
employees or directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries beyond their
retirement or other termination of service, other than coverage mandated by
the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, or
comparable state law.

(k) Each material Company Benefit Plan that is governed by the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States or provides compensation or
benefits to any employee or former employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or any dependent thereof) who resides outside of the United
States (each a " _Foreign Company Benefit Plan_ ") is set forth on  _Schedule
4.14(k)_. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
with respect to each Foreign Company Benefit Plan, (i) such Foreign Company
Benefit Plan has been maintained, funded and administered in material
compliance with applicable laws and the requirements of such Foreign Company
Benefit Plans governing documents, (ii) except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, all contributions to such Foreign Company
Benefit Plan have been timely paid or made in full or, to the extent not yet
due, properly accrued on the Financial Statements in accordance with the
terms of the Foreign Company Benefit Plan and all applicable Laws, (iii) such
Foreign Company Benefit Plan has obtained from the Governmental Authority
having jurisdiction with respect to such Foreign Company Benefit Plan any
required determinations, if any, that such Foreign Company Benefit Plan is in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable laws and regulations
of the relevant jurisdiction if such determinations are required in order to
give effect to such Foreign Company Benefit Plan, and (iv) neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the
Transactions (either alone or in combination with another event) will create
or otherwise result in any increased liability of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to such Foreign Company Benefit Plan. No Foreign
Company Benefit Plan has any unfunded or underfunded liabilities not
accurately accrued in accordance with GAAP. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is, or has at any time been, the employer or "connected with"
or an "associate of" (as those terms are used in the Pensions Act 2004 of the
United Kingdom) the employer of a United Kingdom defined benefit pension
plan.

its Subsidiaries has: (i) taken any action since January 1, 2020 related to

indirectly, including any actual or expected group terminations, layoffs,
furloughs, shutdowns (whether voluntary or by applicable Law), reduced working
schedules or any material changes to benefit or compensation programs,
including material reductions in compensation, benefits or working schedules,
or material changes to any Company Benefit Plan; (ii) claimed any Tax credits
under Section 2301 of the CARES Act or Sections 7001-7003 of the Families
First Coronavirus Response Act or I.R.S. Notice 2020-65 or any similar
applicable Law; or (iii) deferred any Taxes under Section 2302 under the CARES
Act or any similar applicable Law, and, in each case, none of the foregoing
actions are reasonably anticipated. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any plan, program, arrangement or Contract with any
employee currently on furlough, leave or other alternative work arrangement
pursuant to which any employees continued employment or reinstatement
(including any reinstatement of any reduction or change in compensation or
benefits) is guaranteed.

to Acquirors knowledge, threatened in writing against Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries by any third party claiming infringement, misappropriation or
other violation of Intellectual Property. Except as would not reasonably be
expected to be material to Acquiror or the applicable Subsidiary whose
business is allegedly infringing, misappropriating or violating, within the
three years preceding the date of this Agreement, the conduct of Acquirors
and its Subsidiaries business has not infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
violated the Intellectual Property of any third party. To the knowledge of
Acquiror, no third party is infringing, misappropriating or otherwise
violating any Acquiror Owned Intellectual Property.

(d) Acquiror and its Subsidiaries have a valid license to use or otherwise
have the lawful right to use, all of the Acquiror Intellectual Property as
used in the conduct of the business of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries. Acquiror
and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
and protect each item of Acquiror Intellectual Property that is material to
their business.

 

(e) No director, officer or employee of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries
has any direct ownership interest in any of the Acquiror Intellectual
Property. Employees and contractors of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries who
create or develop any Intellectual Property in the course of their employment
or provision of services for Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries have assigned
to Acquiror or its Subsidiary all of such employees or contractors rights
in such Intellectual Property, and without limiting the foregoing all such
employees and contractors have

 



73

    

 executed valid written agreements pursuant to which such Persons have
assigned to Acquiror or its Subsidiary all of such employees or contractors
rights in and to such Intellectual Property that did not vest automatically
in Acquiror or its Subsidiary by operation of law (and, in the case of
contractors, to the extent such Intellectual Property was intended to be
proprietary to Acquiror or its Subsidiary).

 

(f) Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries is in material compliance with the
terms and conditions of all material licenses for Open Source Materials used
by Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries in any way.

made available, or distributed with, or used in the delivery or provision of
any Owned Acquiror Software in a manner that requires or obligates Acquiror or
any of its Subsidiaries to: (i) disclose, distribute, or otherwise make
available such Owned Acquiror Software in source code form; (ii) license such
Owned Acquiror Software for the purpose of making derivative works; (iii)
license such Owned Acquiror Software at no charge; or (iv) grant a license to,
or refrain from asserting or enforcing any of, its Patents.

(h) The IT Systems of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries operate and perform in all
material respects as is necessary for the business of Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted, and do not contain any material faults,
viruses or hardware components designed to permit unauthorized access to or to
disable or otherwise harm any computer systems or Software. To the knowledge
of Acquiror, there has been no material failure of such IT Systems in the past
two years which has not been fully resolved. There have been no unauthorized
intrusions, access to or breaches of such IT Systems. Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries have in place adequate security controls and disaster recovery
plans and procedures for such IT Systems. Such IT Systems provide the
operations of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries, including the internet
websites and mobile applications provided to Acquirors customers, with
sufficient redundancy and speed to meet industry standards relating to high
availability and Acquiror has no reason to believe that such IT Systems will
not operate or will not continue to be accessible to end users on a high
availability basis after the Closing Date.

(i) Acquiror and its Subsidiaries have a privacy policy (the " _Acquiror
Privacy Policy_ ") regarding the collection and use of Personal Information, a
true, correct and complete copy of which has been provided to the Company
prior to the date hereof. Since December 31, 2017, Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with (i) all applicable
Privacy Laws, (ii) the Acquiror Privacy Policy, and (iii) all of Acquirors
and its Subsidiaries contractual obligations with respect to Personal
Information. The execution, delivery and performance of the Transactions do
not violate the Acquiror Privacy Policy as it currently exists. Neither
Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries sells or, since December 31, 2017, has
sold (for monetary or other consideration) Personal Information.

measures in place designed to protect Personal Information stored in their IT
Systems from any Security Incidents. To the knowledge of Acquiror, since
December 31, 2017, there have not been any Security Incidents or claims
related to Security Incidents and there are no information security or other
vulnerabilities that are reasonably likely to cause a Security Incident. No

 



74

    

 Actions are pending or, to the knowledge of Acquiror, threatened in writing
against Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the collection, use,
processing or storage of Personal Information.

Affiliates.

 

(h) No amount or benefit that will or could be, or has been, received (whether

indebtedness or otherwise) by any current or former employee, independent
contractor, officer or director of Acquiror or any Subsidiary of Acquiror who
is a "disqualified individual" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code
would reasonably be expected to be characterized as an "excess parachute
payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) as a result of the
consummation of the Transactions (either alone or in combination with
any other event).

(i) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be

 former employee of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries (or any dependent
thereof) who resides outside of the United States (each a " _Foreign Acquiror
Benefit Plan_ ") is set forth on _Schedule 5.12(k)_. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to
Acquiror and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, with respect to each Foreign

or otherwise result in any increased liability of Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries with respect to such Foreign Acquiror Benefit Plan. No Foreign
Acquiror Benefit Plan has any unfunded or underfunded liabilities not
accurately accrued in accordance with GAAP. Neither Acquiror nor any of its
Subsidiaries is, or has at any time been, the employer or "connected with" or
an "associate of" (as those terms are used in the Pensions Act 2004 of the
United Kingdom) the employer of a United Kingdom defined benefit pension

Commitment Letter, and (B) other than as a result of entry by Acquiror into

(b) The Company will give Acquiror prompt written notice of any action taken

_provided_ , that, if any such action shall be taken or fail to be taken or
such development shall otherwise occur, Acquiror and the Company shall

fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that no
information received by Acquiror pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.04_ shall

transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement Amendment and/or the
Committed Backstop Financing, including providing the Required Information and
assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations,

authorization or representation letters referenced above for purposes of
effecting the cooperation envisioned hereunder); and (b) nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.06_ will require the Company (or its Subsidiaries) to take

its Subsidiaries) or result in a breach or default under the Existing Credit
Agreement. It is understood and agreed for the avoidance of doubt that the
Company shall not have any obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.06(a)_
after the date on which the Credit Agreement Amendment becomes effective.

cooperation required to be provided under this _Section_ __ _ 6.06_ in
connection with any debt financing other than the Committed Backstop Financing
contemplated by the Backstop Commitment Letter on the date hereof is
materially more onerous than what is required to be provided pursuant to this

contemplated by the Backstop Commitment Letter on the date hereof (any such
more onerous requirement, an " _Incremental Debt Financing Cooperation
Requirement_ ") and (ii) the Company reasonably refuses to satisfy any
Incremental Debt Financing Cooperation Requirement, then such failure shall
not be deemed to be a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.06 _for purposes of

ARTICLE VII

 

COVENANTS OF ACQUIROR

 

7.01 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Acquiror and the
Surviving Company agree that they shall indemnify and hold harmless each
present and former director and officer of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Action,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent that the Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would
have been permitted under applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation,
bylaws or other organizational documents in effect on the date of this
Agreement to indemnify such Indemnified Person (including the advancing of
expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law).
Without limiting the foregoing, Acquiror shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries to, (i) maintain for a period of not less than
six years from the Effective Time provisions in its certificate of
incorporation (if applicable), bylaws and other organizational documents
concerning the indemnification and exoneration (including provisions relating
to expense advancement) of officers and directors that are no less favorable
in any material respect to those Indemnified Persons than the provisions of
such certificates of incorporation (if applicable), bylaws and other
organizational documents as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any material respect that would
adversely affect the rights of those Indemnified Persons thereunder, in each
case, except as required by Law. Acquiror shall assume, and be liable for, and
shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to honor, each of the
covenants in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.01_.

(b) Acquiror and the Company shall reasonably cooperate in connection with
obtaining the "tail" policy referenced in the following sentence.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company shall be entitled to procure "tail" directors and officers liability
insurance policies covering each Indemnified Person with a claims reporting
or discovery period of at least six years from the Effective Time placed with
insurance companies having the same or better AM Best Financial rating as the
Companys and its Subsidiaries current directors and officers liability
insurance companies with terms and

 



99

    

 conditions providing retentions, limits and other material terms no less
favorable in any material respect than the current directors and officers
liability insurance policies maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
Company be permitted to spend more than 275% of the last annual premium paid
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof for the six
years of coverage under such "tail" policies, which last annual premium is set
forth on _Schedule 7.01(b)_.

 

(c) In the event that Acquiror, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Acquiror and the Surviving Company shall ensure that proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Acquiror or the Surviving
Company, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in
this  _Section_ __ _ 7.01_. The obligations of Acquiror and the Surviving
Company under this _Section_ __ _ 7.01_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
materially and adversely affect any Indemnified Person (or any such
Indemnified Persons heirs and representatives) to whom this _Section_ __ _
7.01_ applies without the prior written consent of the affected
Indemnified Person (and, after the death of such Indemnified Person, such
Indemnified Persons heirs and representatives).

(d) Each of the Indemnified Persons referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 7.01_
(and, after the death of any such Indemnified Person, such Indemnified
Persons heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.01_, with full rights of enforcement
as if a party thereto. The rights of Indemnified Persons under this _Section_
__ _ 7.01_ (and, after the death of such Indemnified Person, such
Indemnified Persons heirs and representatives) shall be in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights that such individuals may have under
the certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or
entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law
(whether at law or in equity).

its Subsidiaries by third parties that may be in Acquirors or its
Subsidiaries possession from time to time, and except for any information

than to the extent such information is to be provided to the Company in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement) or the negotiation of this

Acquiror would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege or other
privilege from disclosure or would conflict with any applicable Law or
confidentiality obligations to which Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound, Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to the
Company, its Affiliates and its and their Representatives reasonable access
during the Interim Period, during normal business hours and with reasonable
advance notice, in such manner as to not interfere with the normal operation
of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries, to all of their respective properties,
books, projections, plans, systems, Contracts, Acquiror Real Estate Lease
Documents, commitments, Tax Returns, records, commitments, analyses and, as
reasonably requested by the Company or its Representatives, appropriate
officers and employees of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries, and shall furnish as
promptly as practicable to the Company and/or its Representatives all
financial and operating data and other information concerning the business,
properties, Contracts, personnel and other affairs of Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries that are in the possession of Acquiror or its Subsidiaries as
such Representatives may reasonably request (including information for
purposes of transition and integration planning and monthly and quarterly
financial statements and other financial information prepared by Acquirors
management if requested by the Company). The parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to make alternative arrangements for such disclosure where
the restrictions in the preceding sentence apply, including that Acquiror
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any required consent
of such third party to such access or disclosure or, if unable to do so, to
make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit the maximum access or
disclosure not in violation of such consent requirement. All information
obtained by the Company, its Affiliates and its and their Representatives
under this Agreement shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement prior
to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding

 



103

    

 anything to the contrary contained herein, no action taken in connection
with or as a result of a COVID-19 Measure by Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to violate or breach this _Section_ __ _ 7.03_
in any way, _provided_ that Acquiror shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
access in a manner that does not jeopardize the health and safety of any
employee or Representative of any party or any of their Affiliates.

7.04  _Acquiror NYSE Listing_.

(a) From the date hereof through the Closing, Acquiror shall use reasonable
best efforts to ensure Acquiror remains listed as a public company on, and
for shares of Acquiror Common Stock to remain listed on, the NYSE.

(b) Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Acquiror
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Acquiror Common Stock to be
issued in connection with the Transactions to be approved for listing on the
NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. The Company will reasonably
cooperate with Acquiror as reasonably requested by Acquiror with respect to
the listing application for the Acquiror Common Stock and promptly furnish to

that may be required or reasonably requested in connection with any action
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 7.04(b)_.

 

7.05 _Acquiror Public Filings_. From the date hereof through the Closing,
Acquiror will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep current and timely
file all reports required to be filed or furnished with the SEC and otherwise
comply in all material respects with its reporting obligations under
applicable Securities Laws.

 

7.06 _Section_ __ _ 16_ _Matters_. Prior to the Closing, the Acquiror Board,
or an appropriate committee of "non-employee directors" (as defined in Rule
16b-3 of the Exchange Act) thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with
the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the acquisition of Acquiror
Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Acquiror Common
Stock) pursuant to this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated
hereby, by any person owning securities of the Company who is, or is
reasonably expected to become in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions, subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to Acquiror or the Company, shall be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act.

7.07 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Acquiror shall assume, honor and fulfill all of the Company Benefit Plans
in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the date
hereof or as subsequently amended or terminated as permitted pursuant to the
terms of such Company Benefit Plans and this Agreement. Effective as of the
Effective Time and for a period ending on December 31, 2021, subject to
any actions taken reasonably and in good faith connection with a COVID-19
Measure, Acquiror shall provide, and shall cause its Affiliates to provide, to
each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues to be
employed by Acquiror or any Subsidiary thereof (the " _Continuing Employees_
"), (i) at least the same wage rate or base salary

 



104

    

 as in effect for such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (ii) employee benefits (excluding equity incentive compensation,
retention, change-in-control or other special or non-recurring compensation or
benefits) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided
to such Continuing Employees as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cause all Continuing
Employees to receive service credit for service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for all purposes where length of
service is relevant under any employee benefit plans and arrangements
in which such Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate following
the Effective Time, except to the extent such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits. To the extent that Acquiror or any of its Affiliates
modifies any health or welfare coverage or benefits under any Company Benefit
Plan in which the Continuing Employees participate following the Effective
Time, Acquiror or its applicable Affiliate shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to waive any applicable waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or
actively-at-work requirements under the analogous employee benefit plan of
Acquiror or its Affiliates and shall give such Continuing Employees credit
under such analogous employee benefit plan of Acquiror for deductibles, co-
insurance and out-of-pocket payments that have been paid during the year in
which such health or welfare coverage or benefit modification occurs.

 

(c) If, at least ten Business Days prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror
provides written notice to the Company directing the Company to terminate its
401(k) plan(s), the Company shall terminate any and all 401(k) plans
(collectively, the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") effective as of the day
immediately preceding the day on which the Effective Time occurs (the "
_401(k) Termination Date_ "). In the event that Acquiror requests that the
Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, the Company shall provide Acquiror with
evidence that the Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated pursuant to
resolution of the Company Board prior to the day on which the Effective Time
occurs; _ provided_ that, prior to amending or terminating the Company 401(k)
Plan, the Company shall provide Acquiror with the form and substance of any
applicable resolutions or amendments for review and approval (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the Company
401(k) Plan is terminated pursuant to this _ Section 7.07(c)_, then
immediately following the 401(k) Termination Date, Acquiror shall permit all
Continuing Employees who were participants in the Company 401(k) Plan as of
the 401(k) Termination Date to participate in Acquirors 401(k) plan. The
Company agrees that it shall not provide for either a discretionary match or
a profit sharing contribution under any Company 401(k) Plan for any period
following the date of this Agreement.

 

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, (i) the Company shall submit for approval by
the Company Stockholders, in conformance with Section 280G of the Code and
the regulations thereunder (the " _280G Stockholder Vote_ "), any payments
that constitute or would reasonably be expected to constitute "parachute
payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code (each, a " _Parachute Payment_
") on behalf of each "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G of
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) and which are irrevocably
waived by such individual under clause "(ii)" hereof, (ii) prior to the
distribution of the 280G Stockholder Vote materials, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver of the right to receive or
retain any Parachute Payment (in the absence of the 280G Stockholder Vote)
from

 



105

    

 each of the applicable "disqualified individuals" (as defined under Section
280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) whose Parachute
Payments would be subject to the 280G Stockholder Vote, and (iii) the Company
shall have delivered to Acquiror complete copies of all disclosure and other
related documents that will be provided to the Company Stockholders in
connection with the 280G Stockholder Vote in a manner providing Acquiror with
sufficient time to review and comment thereon, and the Company shall consider
all reasonable comments of Acquiror in good faith. The parties acknowledge
that, to the extent any arrangements entered into at the direction of
Acquiror or between Acquiror and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and a
disqualified individual, on the other hand (" _Acquiror Arrangements_ ") are
Parachute Payments, Acquiror shall provide to the Company a
written description of any Acquiror Arrangements and the value for purposes
of Section 280G of the Code of such Acquiror Arrangements reasonably in
advance of the Companys request of the waivers under clause "(ii)" above.

 

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, Acquiror
shall grant incentive equity awards under an equity plan maintained by
Acquiror, to those certain Continuing Employees, and in the amounts and on the
terms, as set forth on _Schedule 7.07(e)_ , with any changes to such schedule
to be subject to the consent of the Companys Chief Executive Officer
or Executive Chairman. In no event will the contents of _Schedule 7.07(e)_ be
communicated to any Company employee without Acquirors prior written consent.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Acquiror or any Affiliate of
Acquiror, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of
Acquiror or any Affiliate of Acquiror, which rights are hereby expressly
reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing Employee at
any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the
extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between Acquiror,
the Company or any Affiliate of Acquiror and the Continuing Employee or any
severance, benefit or other applicable plan or program covering such
Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this _ Section 7.07_ shall (i) be deemed or construed to
be an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or employee
benefit plan of Acquiror or its Affiliates or (ii) create any third party
rights in any current or former service provider of the Company or its
Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

7.08 _Financing_.

 

(a) Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Credit
Agreement Amendment following the date hereof through the earlier to occur of
(i) the Closing Date and (ii) the date on which the Committed Backstop
Financing is launched; _provided_ that Acquiror shall not be required to agree
to any amendment, consent, or similar fee in connection with the
Credit Agreement Amendment in excess of an amount to be determined by
Acquiror in its sole discretion.

(b) Acquiror shall use, to the extent the Credit Agreement Amendment is not
obtained on or prior to 45 days following the date hereof, its reasonable best
efforts to consummate and obtain the Committed Backstop Financing on the terms
and conditions described in the Backstop Commitment Letter, including to (i)
maintain in effect the Backstop Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate, execute and
deliver definitive agreements with respect thereto

 



106

    

 on terms and conditions contemplated by the Backstop Commitment Letter (as
such terms may be modified by the "market flex" provisions in the Backstop Fee
Letters or on other terms (x) that comply with the Backstop Amendment
Limitations (as defined below) or (y) to which Acquiror and the Company may
both consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed)), (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to
Acquiror in the Backstop Commitment Letter and, if applicable, the definitive
agreements for the Committed Backstop Financing reasonably within Acquirors
control and that have not been duly waived, (iv) consummate the Committed
Backstop Financing contemplated by the Backstop Commitment Letter at or prior
to the Closing (to the extent the Credit Agreement Amendment has not been
obtained at or prior to Closing) and (v) apply the proceeds of the Committed
Backstop Financing to refinance the indebtedness outstanding under the
Acquiror Term Loan Agreement (to the extent the Credit Agreement Amendment has
not been obtained at or prior to Closing). Subject to the terms and
upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Backstop Commitment
Letter, if the Credit Agreement Amendment is not obtained on or prior to the
Closing Date, Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Backstop Lenders to provide the Committed Backstop Financing on or prior to
the Closing Date. Acquiror may from time to time substitute other financing
for all or any portion of the Committed Backstop Financing from the same
and/or alternative financing sources or by means of an equity offering;
_provided_ , that, without the Companys consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), such substitute financing
shall not (A) delay or prevent the Closing, (B) in the aggregate, be less
than the amount of the Committed Backstop Financing that is being substituted
by such substitute financing, (C) (I) be subject to conditions that would or
would reasonably be expected to delay, prevent or otherwise adversely impact
the ability of Acquiror to obtain such substitute financing or any remaining
portion of the Committed Backstop Financing at or prior to the Closing or (II)
have terms that would require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take
any action that would result in a breach of or default under the Existing
Credit Agreement, (D) make the funding of any remaining portion of the
Committed Backstop Financing (or satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
thereto) less likely to occur at or prior to the Closing, or (E) adversely
impact (x) the ability of Acquiror to consummate the Transactions or (y) the
ability of Acquiror to enforce its rights against other parties under the
Backstop Commitment Letter (the foregoing clauses "(A)" through "(E)," the "
_Alternative Financing Limitations_ ")). Subject to the immediately preceding
sentence, unless the Credit Agreement Amendment is obtained on or prior to the
Closing Date, Acquiror shall not amend, replace, supplement or otherwise
modify, or waive any of its rights under, the Backstop Commitment Letter
without the prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to the extent that such
amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification, or waiver would or
would reasonably be expected to (1) delay or prevent the Closing, (2) reduce
the aggregate net proceeds of the Committed Backstop Financing from that
contemplated by the Backstop Commitment Letter as in effect on the date
hereof, (3) impose (x) new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend
or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Committed Backstop
Financing, in each case, in a manner that would or would reasonably be
expected to delay, prevent, make less likely or otherwise adversely impact the
ability of Acquiror to obtain the Committed Backstop Financing at or prior to
the Closing or (y) terms that would require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to take any action that would result in a breach of or default
under the Existing Credit Agreement, (4) make the funding of the Committed
Backstop Financing (or satisfaction or waiver of the conditions thereto) less
likely to

 



107

    

 occur at or prior to the Closing, or (5) adversely impact (x) the ability of
Acquiror to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
Closing Date or (y) the ability of Acquiror to enforce its rights against
other parties under the Backstop Commitment Letter (the foregoing clauses
"(1)" through "(5)," the " _Backstop Amendment Limitations_ "); it being
understood that notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquiror may amend the
Backstop Commitment Letter to add _bona fide_ credit worthy lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities (it being
understood and agreed that any existing lead arranger, bookrunner,
syndication agent or similar entity under the Acquiror Term Loan Agreement or
the Acquiror ABL Agreement as of the date hereof, and their respective
creditworthy Affiliates, shall be deemed to satisfy this requirement) that
had not executed the Backstop Commitment Letter as of the date of this
Agreement and otherwise amend, modify or restate the Backstop Commitment
Letter in any manner that does not violate the Backstop Amendment Limitations.
Upon request of the Company, Acquiror shall keep the Company reasonably
informed on a current basis and in reasonable detail of material developments
in respect of the Committed Backstop Financing, the Credit Agreement Amendment
and the processes relating thereto.

 

(c) Acquiror shall give Company prompt notice (i) if, to its or any of its
Subsidiaries knowledge, there exists any material breach by any party to the
Backstop Commitment Letter or any condition thereunder which would reasonably
be expected not to be satisfied or waived, (ii) of any termination of the
Backstop Commitment Letter or the receipt of any written notice or
other written communication from any Financing Source asserting any default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any of the Backstop Commitment
Letter or definitive agreements related to the Committed Backstop Financing,
and (iii) if at any time for any reason (other than obtaining the Credit
Agreement Amendment) Acquiror believes in good faith that Acquiror will not be
able to obtain all or any portion of the Committed Backstop Financing on the
terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any
of the Backstop Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the
Committed Backstop Financing, other than any amounts that are otherwise being
obtained pursuant to other substitute financing in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 7.08(b)_.

(d) If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Acquiror
to satisfy its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 7.08_, the Committed
Backstop Financing or the Backstop Commitment Letter (or any definitive
financing agreement relating thereto) expire or are terminated or become
unavailable prior to the Closing, in whole or in part, for any reason (other
than as a result of the Credit Agreement Amendment being obtained), Acquiror
shall (i) promptly notify the Company of such expiration, termination, or
unavailability and the reasons therefor and (ii) use reasonable best efforts
promptly to arrange for alternative financing from alternative sources ("
_Replacement Financing_ ") to replace the financing contemplated by such
expired, terminated, or unavailable commitment or arrangement with one or
more financings that comply with the Alternative Financing Limitations.
Acquiror shall deliver to the Company true and correct copies of any new
financing commitment letter (including any associated engagement letter and
related fee letter; _provided_ , that any such commitment letter, engagement
letter or fee letter may be redacted to remove fee amounts, the economic
portion of any "market flex" provisions, pricing caps and other economic
terms set forth therein, none of which affect the availability or net amount
of such Replacement Financing or require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to take any action that would result in a breach of or default
under the Existing 

 



108

    

 Credit Agreement) executed by Acquiror, pursuant to which any alternative
source shall have committed to provide any portion of such Replacement
Financing (the " _Replacement Financing Documents_ ").

(e) If the Backstop Commitment Letter is amended, replaced, supplemented or
otherwise modified, if all or a portion of the Committed Backstop Financing
is substituted in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.08(b)_, if the Acquiror
obtains Replacement Financing or if the parties both consent to substitute
other committed financing for all or a portion of the Committed Backstop
Financing, Acquiror shall comply with its covenants in _Sections 7.08(b)_ and
_7.08(c)_ with respect to the Replacement Financing Documents or the Backstop
Commitment Letter (as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise
modified), in each case, to the same extent that Acquiror would have been
obligated to comply with respect to the Committed Backstop Financing, and the
references in this Agreement to "Backstop Commitment Letter" and "Committed
Backstop Financing" shall be deemed to refer to the Backstop Commitment Letter
(and the financing contemplated thereby) as so amended, replaced, supplemented
or otherwise modified or the Replacement Financing Documents (and the
financing contemplated thereby), as applicable.

(f) Upon the reasonable request of the Company, Acquiror shall, promptly,
furnish the Company with current copies of any marketing materials, rating
agency presentations, information memoranda, term sheets, definitive
documentation or any other material documents prepared or received by such
party (or any of its Affiliates) in connection with the Credit Agreement
Amendment (other than any internal documents prepared by Acquiror and not
distributed to lenders or their counsel or any other third party). If Acquiror
successfully obtains such a Credit Agreement Amendment, Acquiror shall,
promptly upon execution thereof, furnish the Company with a true and complete
copy of such Credit Agreement Amendment.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is
understood and agreed that it is not a condition to Closing under this
Agreement, nor to the consummation of the Merger, for Acquiror to obtain the
Committed Backstop Financing, the Credit Agreement Amendment, any alternative
financing and/or any Replacement Financing.

7.09 _Stockholder Litigation_. Each of Acquiror and the Company shall give
the other the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
stockholder claim or litigation (including any class action or derivative
litigation) against such party or its officers or directors relating to this
Agreement and the Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without the prior written consent of the other, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , that the
foregoing shall not require any party hereto to take any action if it may
result in a waiver of any attorney-client or any other similar privilege;
_provided_ , _further_ , that such party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to allow for the taking of such action in a manner that does not result in a
waiver of such privilege, including by entering into a customary joint defense
or similar agreement. Each of Acquiror and the Company shall

 



109

    

 cooperate, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates
and Representatives to cooperate, in the defense against such claim or
litigation.

in _Article_ __ _ VI_,  _Article_ __ _ VII_ or this _Article_ __ _ VIII_,
including the obligations of the Company and Acquiror with respect to the
notifications, filings, reaffirmations and applications described in 
_Section_ __ _ 8.02_, which obligations shall control to the extent of any
conflict with the succeeding provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.01_,
Acquiror and the Company shall each, and shall each cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to: (a) assemble, prepare and file

third parties that any of Acquiror, the Company or their respective Affiliates
are required to obtain in connection with the Transactions, including any

agreements listed on _Schedule 6.03_ ; and (d) take such other action as may
reasonably be necessary to satisfy the conditions of  _Article_ __ _ IX_ or

bear any expense or pay any fee or grant any concession in connection with

consolidating with, or by purchasing a portion of the assets of or equity in,
or by any other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership,
association or other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise
acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into of a definitive
agreement relating to, or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or

authorizations, consents, orders or declarations of any Regulatory
Consent Authorities or the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period; (ii) materially increase the risk of any Regulatory Consent
Authority entering an order prohibiting the

and the Consent Solicitation Statement contained therein, the " _Registration
Statement_ ") in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of
the Acquiror Common Stock to be issued under this Agreement, which

Solicitation Statement. Each of Acquiror and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement, the Proxy
Statement and the Consent Solicitation Statement to comply with the rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC, to have the Registration Statement
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after

reasonably be requested by the other party in connection with such actions and
the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement and the

upon (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), any response to comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Registration Statement and any amendment to the Registration Statement filed
in response thereto. If Acquiror or the Company becomes aware that any
information contained in the Registration Statement shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect or that the Registration Statement is
required to be amended in order to comply with applicable Law, then (i) such
party shall promptly inform the other parties and (ii) Acquiror, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall cooperate and mutually agree
upon (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement. Acquiror and the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement
as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and, if appropriate,
Acquiror shall cause such amendment or supplement to be disseminated to the
stockholders of Acquiror, as applicable, in each case pursuant to applicable
Law and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Acquiror Organizational Documents. Each of the Company and Acquiror shall
provide the other parties with copies of any written comments, and shall
inform such other parties of any oral comments, that Acquiror receives from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Registration Statement promptly
after the receipt of such comments and shall give the other parties a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any proposed written or oral
responses to such comments prior to responding to the SEC or its staff.

other proposals reasonably agreed by Acquiror and the Company to be necessary
or appropriate in connection with the transaction contemplated

 



119

practicable: (i) establish the record date (which record date shall be

the Acquiror Stockholder Approval with respect to each of the Proposals.
Acquiror shall, through the Acquiror Board, recommend to the Acquiror
Stockholders that they approve the Proposals (the " _Acquiror Board
Recommendation_ ") and shall include the Acquiror Board Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement, unless the Acquiror Board shall have changed the
recommendation in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.03(d)_ and _Section_ __ _
8.03(f)_. The Acquiror Board shall not (and no committee or subgroup thereof
shall) change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to
change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, the Acquiror Board
Recommendation (an " _Acquiror Change in Recommendation_ ") except as may be
permitted by, and only in accordance with, _Section_ __ _ 8.03(d)_ and 
_Section_ __ _ 8.03(f)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this

scheduled, Acquiror has not received proxies representing a sufficient number
of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to obtain the Acquiror Requisite Approval,

adjournments of the Special Meeting, in the case of a first adjournment, for
a period not to exceed 10 days after consulting with the Company, and in the
case of a second adjournment, for a period not to exceed five days after
consulting with the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that, unless otherwise
required by Law, Acquiror shall not change the record date for the Special
Meeting in connection with any such adjournment without the Companys prior
approval. Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its
terms, Acquirors obligation to solicit proxies from the Acquiror
Stockholders to obtain the Acquiror Stockholder Approval with respect to each
of the Proposals in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 8.04(d)_ shall not be
limited or otherwise affected by the making, commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission of any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal
with respect to Acquiror, or by any Acquiror Change in Recommendation.

 

(e) The Company shall solicit the Company Requisite Approval via written
consent as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement becomes

efforts to, as promptly as practicable: (i) establish the record date for
determining the Company Stockholders entitled to provide such written consent
(which record date shall be mutually agreed with Acquiror); (ii) cause the
Consent Solicitation Statement to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders
in compliance with applicable Law; and (iii) solicit written consents from the
Company Stockholders to give the Company Requisite Approval. The Company
shall, through the Company Board, recommend to the Company Stockholders that
they adopt this Agreement (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ") and shall
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Consent Solicitation
Statement, unless the Company Board shall have changed the recommendation in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.03(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.03(e)_.
The Company Board shall not (and no committee or subgroup thereof shall)
change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or

 



120

    

 modify, or publicly propose to change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or
modify, the Company Board Recommendation (a " _Company Change in
Recommendation_ ") except as may be permitted by, and only in in accordance
with, _Section_ __ _ 8.03(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.03(e)_. The Company will
provide Acquiror with copies of all stockholder consents it receives within
one Business Day of receipt. If the Company Requisite Approval is obtained,
then promptly following the receipt of the required written consents, the
Company will prepare and deliver to the Company Stockholders who have not
consented the notice required by Section 228(e) of the DGCL. Unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Companys
obligation to solicit written consents by means of the Consent Solicitation
Statement from the Company Stockholders to give the Company
Requisite Approval in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 8.04(e)_ shall not
be limited or otherwise affected by the making, commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission of any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal
with respect to the Company, or by any Company Change in Recommendation.

(a) As promptly as practicable after execution of this Agreement, Acquiror

Communications Plan described in  _Section_ __ _ 8.07(b)_, Acquiror and the

qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment. None of the parties or their

(d) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated by Acquiror
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.01(b)(i)_,  _Section_ __ _ 10.01(b)(ii)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 10.01(i)_ or by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _

and is not publicly withdrawn as of the date of such termination and (ii)
within 12 months after the date of termination, the Company shall have

Acquiror (or one or more of its designees), as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and, in any event, within two Business Days) after the date on
which the Acquisition Proposal is consummated, payable by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (it being understood that, for the purposes of
this clause "(c)," each reference to "20%" in the definition of "Acquisition

"51%").

 

(e) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company

reference to "51%").

 

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that the Company
Termination Payment and the Acquiror Termination Payment, as applicable, if,
as and when required pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.02_, shall not
constitute a penalty but will be liquidated damages in a reasonable amount
that will compensate Acquiror or the Company, as applicable, in the
circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The parties
hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Company Termination Payment or Acquiror be required to pay
the Acquiror Termination Payment, as applicable, on more than one occasion.
Each of the Company, Acquiror and Merger Sub acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 10.02_ are an integral part of the
Transactions and that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would not
enter into this Agreement.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
any circumstance (except in the case of Willful Breach of this Agreement or
Fraud) in which this Agreement is terminated and Acquiror is paid the Company
Termination Payment or the Company is paid the Acquiror Termination Payment
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 10.02_, the Company Termination Payment or
the Acquiror Termination Payment, as applicable, shall be the sole and
exclusive monetary remedy of Acquiror, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates
against the Company or any of its Affiliates, or of the Company or any of its
Affiliates against Acquiror, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates, as
applicable, for any loss or damage suffered in connection with the
Transactions or as a result of the failure of the Merger and the other
Transactions to be consummated or for a breach (other than a Willful Breach or
Fraud) of, or failure to perform under, this Agreement or any certificate or
other document delivered in connection herewith or otherwise, and upon
payment of such amounts, the Company and its Affiliates, or Acquiror, Merger
Sub and their Affiliates, as applicable, shall have no further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or in respect of
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, whether in
equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company
(on behalf of itself and each Company Related Party (other than Acquiror and
Merger Sub)) shall not have any and hereby waives any rights or claims against
any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Backstop
Commitment Letter, the Committed Backstop Financing, the

 



129

    

 definitive financing agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise) or in respect of any oral or written
representations made or alleged to be made by any Financing Source in
connection herewith or therewith, in each case relating to the Transactions,
and the Company (on behalf of itself and each Company Related Party (other
than Acquiror and Merger Sub)) agrees not to commence any Action against any
Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Backstop Commitment
Letter, the Committed Backstop Financing, the definitive financing agreements
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or in respect of any other
document or theory of law or equity, in each case in connection with the
Transactions, and agrees to cause any such Action asserted by the Company (on
behalf of itself and each Company Related Party (other than Acquiror and
Merger Sub)) in connection with this Agreement, the Committed Backstop
Financing, the definitive financing agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or in respect of any other document or theory
of law or equity against any Financing Source, in each case in connection with
the Transactions, to be dismissed or otherwise terminated, and no Financing
Source shall have any rights or claims against any Company Related
Party (other than Acquiror and Merger Sub) in connection with this Agreement,
the Committed Backstop Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. In
furtherance, and not in limitation of, the foregoing waiver, it is
acknowledged and agreed that no Financing Source shall have any liability for
any claims or damages to the Company or any Company Related Party (other than
Acquiror or Merger Sub) in connection with this Agreement, the Backstop
Commitment Letter, the Committed Backstop Financing, the definitive financing
arrangements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, in each case
in connection with the Transactions. It is understood and agreed that the
foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 10.02(h) _will not limit the
rights of the parties to the Committed Backstop Financing under any commitment
letter relating thereto.

11.03 _Assignment_. No party hereto shall assign this Agreement or any part
hereof without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that
Acquiror (or one of more of its Affiliates) shall have the right, without the
prior written consent of the Company, to assign all or any portion of its

131

    

 assigning collateral in respect of the Committed Backstop Financing or the

any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors and assigns. Any attempted assignment in
violation of the terms of this  _Section_ __ _ 11.03_ shall be null and
void, _ab initio_.

11.04 _Rights of Third Parties_. Nothing expressed or implied in this
Agreement is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give any Person,
other than the parties hereto, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing (a) in the event the Closing occurs, the
present and former officers and directors of the Company and Acquiror (and
their successors, heirs and representatives) are intended third-
party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, _Section_ __ _ 7.01 _and (b) the
Financing Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of _Section_ __ _
10.02(h)_, _Section_ __ _ 11.04_,  _Section_ __ _ 11.11_, _Section_ __ _

benefit or otherwise affect the rights of, the Financing Sources, each of
such provisions of such Sections (to such extent) shall expressly inure to
the benefit of the Financing Sources, and the Financing Sources shall be
entitled to rely on and enforce the provisions of such Sections (to such
extent).

 

11.05 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein (including _Section_ __
_ 8.02(d)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 8.06(a)_), each party hereto shall bear its
own expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions

including all fees of its legal counsel, financial advisers and accountants.

11.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of
action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
Transactions, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws
of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles or rules of
conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of Laws of another jurisdiction.

11.07 _Captions; Counterparts_. The table of contents and captions in this
Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or
affect the construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.
This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same instrument, and shall become effective when each party hereto has
received counterparts signed by each of the other parties (it being
understood and agreed that delivery of a signed counterpart signature page to
this Agreement by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in portable
document format (".pdf") form, or by any other electronic means intended
to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document shall
constitute valid and sufficient delivery thereof).

11.08  _Mutual Drafting_. Each party has participated in the drafting of this
Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of good faith
negotiations between the parties. In the event any ambiguity or question of
intent arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.

 



132

    

11.09 _Schedules and Exhibits_. The Schedules and Exhibits referenced herein
are a part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein. The Schedules
shall each be delivered as of the date hereof, and no amendments or
modifications thereto shall be made. All references herein to Schedules and
Exhibits shall be deemed references to such parts of this Agreement, unless
the context shall otherwise require. Any disclosure made by a party in the
Schedules with reference to any section or schedule of this Agreement shall be
deemed to be a disclosure with respect to all other sections or schedules to
which such disclosure may apply solely to the extent the relevance of such
disclosure is reasonably apparent on the face of the disclosure in such
Schedule. Certain information set forth in the Schedules is included solely
for informational purposes.

11.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Schedules and
Exhibits to this Agreement) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement among the parties relating to the Transactions and supersede
any other agreements, whether written or oral, that may have been made or
entered into by or among any of the parties hereto or any of their respective
Subsidiaries relating to the Transactions.

11.11 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole or in
part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing executed in the same
manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to this Agreement;
_provided_ , that after the Company Requisite Approval or the Acquiror
Requisite Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment that by
applicable Law or in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange requires
further approval by the Company Stockholders or by the stockholders of
Acquiror, as applicable, without such further approval of such stockholders.
The approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of any of the parties shall
not restrict the ability of the board of directors of any of the parties to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.01_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained herein,
_Section_ __ _ 10.02(h)_, _Section_ __ _ 11.04_,  _Section_ __ _ 11.11_,
_Section_ __ _ 11.13_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.14_ (and any other provision of
this Agreement to the extent an amendment, supplement, waiver or other
modification of such provision would modify the substance of such Sections in
a manner that is adverse to any Financing Source) may not be amended,
supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in any manner that is adverse in
any respect to the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the
Financing Sources.

11.12 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid
or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions
of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The parties further
agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing this
Agreement, they shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining
provisions of this Agreement valid, legal and enforceable to the fullest
extent permitted by Law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or
otherwise modify this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that
is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable with a valid, legal and enforceable
provision giving effect to the intent of the parties.

 

11.13 _Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_.

 



133

    

(a) Each party hereto irrevocably agrees that any Action based upon, arising
out of or related to this Agreement, or the Transactions, shall be brought in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court declines to
exercise jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of Delaware, and
each of the parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each
such court in any such Action, waives any objection it may now or hereafter
have to personal jurisdiction, venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that
all claims in respect of the Action shall be heard and determined only in any
such court, and agrees not to bring any Action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the Transactions in any other court. Each party hereto
hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such Action: (i) any claim that it
is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for
any reason other than the failure to lawfully serve process; (ii) that it or
its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of such courts or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise); and (iii) that (A) such Action
in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum; (B) the venue of such
Action is improper; and (C) this Agreement, the Transactions or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, each Company Related Party and each of the
other parties hereto (1) irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or Federal court of the
United States of America sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City
in respect of any Action against the Financing Sources arising out of or
relating to the provisions of this Agreement, the Backstop Commitment Letter,
the Backstop Fee Letters, the Transactions and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including but not limited to any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Committed Backstop Financing
or the performance thereof or the transactions contemplated thereby, and
irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of any such Action may be heard
and determined in any such court, (2) agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at its address
provided in _Section_ __ _ 11.02_ shall be effective service of process
against it for any Action relating to any such dispute, (3) waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such Action brought in any
such court, and any claim that any such Action brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum and (4) agrees that a final judgment in
any such Action brought in any such court may be enforced in any other courts
to whose jurisdiction it is or may be subject by suit upon judgment.

 

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMMITTED BACKSTOP FINANCING, THE BACKSTOP
COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, INCLUDING IN ANY ACTION AGAINST ANY FINANCING
SOURCE. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE
EVENT OF ANY

 



134

    

 SUCH ACTION; (II) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER;
(III) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (IV) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 11.13(b)_.

11.14 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that the parties hereto or thereto do not fully perform
their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing
to take such actions as are required of them hereunder or thereunder to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with their specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a)
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance, or other
equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without proof of damages, prior
to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _
10.01_, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
under this Agreement, and (b) the right of specific enforcement is an integral
part of the Transactions and without that right, none of the parties would
have entered into this Agreement. Each party agrees that it will not oppose
the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, or
oppose the granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on the
basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
equity. The parties acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an
injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 11.14_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such injunction.

11.15 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the Transactions may only be brought against, the entities that
are expressly named as parties hereto, and then only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such party. Except to
the extent a named party to this Agreement (and then only to the extent of the
specific obligations undertaken by such named party in this Agreement), (a)
no past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or
Affiliate of any named party to this Agreement and (b) no past, present
or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or
Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any liability (whether in
contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any one or more of the Company, Acquiror or Merger Sub under
this Agreement of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related
to this Agreement or the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 11.15_, nothing in this _Section_ __ _
11.15_ shall in any way limit (i) any liability of the parties to this
Agreement for breaches of the terms and conditions of this Agreement or (ii)
Acquirors or Merger Subs rights under the Support Agreements.

 

11.16 _Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. None of the
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or other agreements in
this Agreement or in any certificate, statement or instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, including any

 



135

    

 rights arising out of any breach of such representation, warranties,
covenants, obligations, agreements and other provisions, shall survive the
Closing and shall terminate and expire upon the occurrence of the Effective
Time (and there shall be no liability after the Closing in respect thereof),
except for those covenants and agreements contained herein that by their terms
expressly apply in whole or in part after the Closing, including the
Surviving Provisions.
