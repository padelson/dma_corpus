Any component of the Post-Closing Statement that is not disputed in a Dispute
Statement shall be final and binding on the Parties and not subject to appeal.
If Sellers do not deliver a Dispute Statement to Buyers within the Review
Period, the Post-Closing Statement shall be final and binding on the Parties
and not subject to appeal and the amount of the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price
as set forth in the Post-Closing Statement shall be deemed to be the Final
Adjusted Cash Purchase Price.

(e) If Sellers deliver a Dispute Statement during the Review Period, Buyers
and Sellers shall promptly meet and attempt in good faith to resolve their
differences with respect to the disputed items set forth in the Dispute
Statement during the fifteen (15) Business Days immediately following Buyers'
receipt of the Dispute Statement, or such longer period as Sellers and Buyers
may mutually agree (the "Resolution Period"). Any such disputed items that are
resolved by Sellers and Buyers during the Resolution Period shall be final and
binding on the Parties and not subject to appeal. If Sellers and Buyers do not
resolve all such disputed items by the end of the Resolution Period, Sellers
and Buyers shall submit all items then remaining in dispute with respect to
the Dispute Statement to the Accounting Firm for review and resolution (with
each Party preparing a submission to the Accounting Firm that reflects all
revisions made to such Party's proposal as a result of the negotiations during
the Resolution Period and outlining the items that remain in dispute at the
time of the submission only). The Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and
not an arbitrator. The Accounting Firm (i) shall determine only those items
remaining in dispute between Sellers and Buyers, (ii) shall apply the
valuation principles set out in Section 3.2(a)(ii) of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule to the extent that the dispute relates to the determination of
Closing Inventory, and (iii) shall only be permitted or authorized to
determine an amount with respect to any such disputed item that is either the
amount of such disputed item as proposed by Buyers in the Post-Closing
Statement or the amount of such disputed item as proposed by Sellers in the
Dispute Statement. Each of Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyers, on the other
hand, shall (A) enter into a customary engagement letter with the Accounting
Firm at the time such dispute is submitted to the Accounting Firm and
otherwise cooperate with the Accounting Firm, (B) have the opportunity to
submit a written statement in support of their respective positions with
respect to 

such disputed items, to provide supporting material to the Accounting Firm in
defense of their respective positions with respect to such disputed items and
to submit a written statement responding to the other Party's position with
respect to such disputed items and (C) subject to customary confidentiality
and indemnity agreements, provide the Accounting Firm with access to their
respective books, records, personnel and representatives and such other
information as the Accounting Firm may require in order to render its
determination. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to deliver to Sellers
and Buyers a written determination (such determination to include a worksheet
setting forth all material calculations used in arriving at such determination
and to be based solely on information provided to the Accounting Firm by
Sellers and Buyers) of the disputed items within thirty (30) calendar days of
receipt of the disputed items, which determination shall be final and binding
on the Parties hereto and not subject to appeal. All fees and expenses
relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Accounting Firm will be
allocated between Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyers, on the other hand, in
the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed items so
submitted to the Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such
party (as finally determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the total
disputed amount of such items so submitted. Neither Party shall engage in ex
parte communications with the Accounting Firm with respect to the Transactions
until the Accounting Firm issues its final determination.

(f) The Adjusted Cash Purchase Price, as determined in accordance with the
final, binding and nonappealable resolution of the calculation of the amount
of Closing Inventory and the amount of Closing MDF Liabilities pursuant to the
terms of Sections 3.2(c), 3.2(d) and 3.2(e) shall be referred to herein as the
"Final Adjusted Cash Purchase Price." As soon as practicable (and in any event
within three (3) Business Days) following the determination of the Final
Adjusted Cash Purchase Price, Buyers or Sellers shall make the following
payment, as applicable:

(i) If the Final Adjusted Cash Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated
Adjusted Cash Purchase Price, then within five (5) Business Days after such
final determination, Buyers shall deliver to Sellers or their designee(s), an
amount in U.S. dollars equal to such excess in immediately available funds by
wire transfer to an account or accounts designated in writing by Sellers or
their designee(s).

(ii) If the Estimated Adjusted Cash Purchase Price is greater than the Final
Adjusted Cash Purchase Price, then within five (5) Business Days after such
final determination, Sellers, jointly and severally, shall deliver to Buyers
an amount in U.S. dollars equal to such excess in immediately available funds
by wire transfer to an account or accounts designated in writing by Buyers.

3.3 Allocation. The Purchase Price and any Assumed Liabilities shall be
allocated among the Acquired Assets to be acquired by each Buyer, as the case
may be, in accordance with applicable Tax Law and the methodology attached as
Section 3.3 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule (the "Allocation Schedule").
Following the determination of the Final Adjusted Cash Purchase Price, the
Allocation Schedule shall be updated to reflect such adjustment or
adjustments, if any. Buyers and Sellers agree to report and to cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries to report, as applicable, the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement in a manner consistent with the Allocation
Schedule for all Tax purposes, and that none of them will take any position or
cause their respective Subsidiaries to take any position inconsistent
therewith in any Tax Return, in any refund claim, in any litigation, or
otherwise, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Buyers and Sellers
shall cooperate with each other in preparing all Tax documentation so it is
consistent with the Allocation Schedule. Buyers and Sellers shall promptly
notify the other Party in writing upon receipt of notice of any pending or
threatened Tax audit or assessment challenging the allocation of the Purchase
Price. 

3.4 Withholding. Buyers and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under any other provision of federal, state, local, or foreign Tax
Law or under any applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid. Prior to the Closing, Canadian Seller shall deliver to Buyers a
properly completed Form W-8BEN, certifying that Canadian Seller is eligible
for benefits under the U.S.-Canada income tax treaty.

Transactions) or any of the other Transaction Agreements. If any Party hereto
or Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional information or
documentary material from any such Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Transactions) or

best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable
and after consultation with the other Parties, an appropriate response in
compliance with such request.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of Section
8.1, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,

on the Closing Date after the Closing in the same manner in which Sellers
operated the AirCard Business on the date hereof and on the Closing Date
before the Closing.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is

categories of assets of Buyers or any of their Affiliates or Sellers or any of
their Subsidiaries, (B) the imposition of any limitation or regulation on the
ability of Buyers or any of their Affiliates to freely conduct their business
or own such assets, or (C) the holding separate of the AirCard Business or any
of the Acquired Assets or any limitation or regulation on the ability of
Buyers or any of their Affiliates to exercise full rights of ownership of the
AirCard Business and the Acquired Assets.

8.3 Access to Information.

(a) During the period from the date hereof and prior to the earlier of the
Closing or the termination of this Agreement, except as otherwise prohibited
by applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that the Parties shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to cause any information that is
withheld pursuant to applicable Law to be provided or made available in a
manner that is not prohibited by applicable Law), Sellers shall afford Buyers
and their accountants, counsel and other representatives, reasonable access
during Sellers' normal business hours to all of the assets, properties, books

Disclosure Schedule, or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties to
consummate the Transactions in accordance with the terms and conditions
hereof, or the remedies available to the Parties hereunder.

(b) From and after the Closing, Sellers shall provide Buyers and their
representatives with reasonable access (with the right to make copies), during

records of Sellers and their Subsidiaries related to the AirCard Business (but
only to the extent applicable to the AirCard Business) as Buyers may
reasonably request.

8.4 Notification of Certain Matters.

(a) Sellers shall promptly notify Buyers of (i) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event that would reasonably be expected to cause any
representation or warranty of Sellers or their Subsidiaries set forth in this

the Closing, (ii) any failure of Sellers or their Subsidiaries to comply with
or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or

Buyers set forth in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect at or prior to the Closing, and (ii) any failure of Buyers to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder in any material respect.

(c) The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 8.4 shall not be
deemed to affect or modify, amend or supplement any representation or warranty

hereunder.

8.5 Confidentiality.

the nature of the legal requirement and the extent of the required disclosure,
and Sellers and their controlled Affiliates shall cooperate with Buyers and
Sellers to preserve the 

confidentiality of such information consistent with such applicable Law or
Order. For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the term "Business
Confidential Information" shall mean all information of a confidential or
proprietary nature (whether or not specifically labeled or identified as

or Order to disclose any Retained Business Confidential Information, as is
necessary to perform its covenants, agreements and obligations, or exercise
its rights or ownership, under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Agreements, or as explicitly permitted by this Section 8.5 or Section 8.7 or
any other provision of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Agreements, Buyers agree not to use or disclose at any time (and shall cause

any time) any Retained Business Confidential Information. In the event Buyers
or any of their controlled Affiliates are required by Law or Order to disclose
any Retained Business Confidential Information, Buyers shall promptly notify
Sellers in writing (unless such requirement is in relation to any Action to
which Buyers or any of their Subsidiaries are a party), which notification
shall include the nature of the legal requirement and the extent of the
required disclosure, and Buyers and their controlled Affiliates shall
cooperate with Sellers and Buyers to preserve the confidentiality of such
information consistent with such applicable Law or Order. For all purposes of
and under this Agreement, the term "Retained Business Confidential
Information" shall mean all information of a confidential or proprietary
nature (whether or not specifically labeled or identified as "confidential"),
in any form or medium, to the extent delivered in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions and related to the business, products,

(d) For a period of five (5) years after the Closing, unless required by Law
or Order to disclose any Transaction Confidential Information, as is necessary
to perform its covenants, agreements and obligations, or exercise its rights
or ownership, under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction 

Agreements, or as explicitly permitted by this Section 8.5 or Section 8.7 or
any other provision of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Agreements, each Buyer and Seller agrees not to (i) disclose at any time (and
shall cause each of their Subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates not to use or
disclose at any time) any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement or any
of the other Transaction Agreements, and (ii) use or disclose at any time (and
shall cause each of their Subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates not to use or
disclose at any time) any Transaction Confidential Information disclosed by
Buyers (in the case of Sellers) or disclosed by Sellers (in the case of
Buyers). In the event any Party or any of its controlled Affiliates are
required by Law or Order to disclose any Transaction Confidential Information
disclosed by Buyers (in the case of Sellers) or disclosed by Sellers (in the
case of Buyers), such Party shall promptly notify the other Parties in
writing, which notification shall include the nature of the legal requirement
and the extent of the required disclosure, and such Party and its controlled
Affiliates shall cooperate with the other Parties to preserve the
confidentiality of such information consistent with such applicable Law or
Order. For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the term "Transaction
Confidential Information" shall mean all information of a confidential or
proprietary nature (whether or not specifically labeled or identified as
"confidential"), in any form or medium, to the extent disclosed by or on
behalf of any Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates to any
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates, or by or on behalf
of any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates to any Buyer
or any of its Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates, as the case may be,
pursuant to the terms or conditions of, or in connection with the performance
of any covenants, agreements or obligations, or exercise of rights, under this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Agreements.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.5:

(i) Sellers shall have no obligation under this Section 8.5 with respect to
(A) any information included in the Excluded Assets that is Technology (other
than any Licensed Technology), (B) Seller Owned Developed Technology (as
defined in the Joint Development Agreement) other than Seller Owned Developed
Technology listed on Schedule B of the Joint Development Agreement, (C)
information that was or has become generally available to the public other
than as a result of disclosure by Sellers or their Affiliates after the date
hereof, or (D) information that is independently developed by Sellers or their
Affiliates (other than by or on behalf of the AirCard Business or Sellers and
their Subsidiaries either prior to the Closing or, under the Joint Development
Agreement, after the Closing) without the use of any Business Confidential
Information, Buyers' or their Affiliates' confidential information or any
Transaction Confidential Information disclosed by Buyers or their Affiliates.
For the avoidance of doubt, Licensed Technology and Seller Owned Developed
Technology listed on Schedule B of the Joint Development Agreement shall be
considered both Business Confidential Information subject to Section 8.5(b)
and Retained Business Confidential Information subject to Section 8.5(c).

(ii) Buyers shall have no obligation under this Section 8.5 with respect to
(A) any information included in the Acquired Assets that is Technology (other
than any Non-Prime Transferred Technology), (B) Buyer Owned Developed

public other than as a result of disclosure by Buyers or their Affiliates
after the date hereof, or (D) information that is independently developed by
Buyers or their Affiliates (other than on behalf of the Retained Business,
under the Joint Development Agreement, after the Closing) without the use of
any Retained Business Confidential Information or any Transaction Confidential
Information disclosed by Sellers or their Affiliates. For the avoidance of
doubt, Non-Prime Transferred Technology and Buyer Owned Developed Technology
listed on Schedule A of the Joint Development Agreement shall be considered
both Business Confidential Information subject to Section 8.5(b) and Retained
Business Confidential Information subject to Section 8.5(c). 

(iii) Sellers may disclose such copies of the Transaction Agreements
(including the schedules and exhibits attached to such Transaction Agreements
and the Sellers Disclosure Schedule) in connection with any material
investment to be made in Sellers or their Subsidiaries or in connection with a
business combination involving, or change of control of, Sellers; provided
that prior to disclosing such copies, Sellers shall have entered into a
customary confidentiality agreement with the recipient of such copies
restricting the disclosure and use of such copies by such recipient in the
same manner as any other confidential or proprietary information disclosed by
Sellers to such recipient.

(iv) Buyers may disclose such copies of the Transaction Agreements (including
the schedules and exhibits attached to such Transaction Agreements and the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule) in connection with any material investment to be
made in Buyers or their Subsidiaries or in connection with a business
combination involving, or change of control of, Buyers; provided that prior to
disclosing such copies, Buyers shall have entered into a customary
confidentiality agreement with the recipient of such copies restricting the
disclosure and use of such copies by such recipient in the same manner as any
other confidential or proprietary information disclosed by Buyers to such
recipient.

(v) To the extent this Section 8.5 imposes obligations on Sellers to protect
the confidentiality of, or not to disclose, any Shared Technology, any Jointly
Owned Developed Technology (as defined in the Joint Development Agreement) or
any Technology licensed to Buyers or Sellers under the Cross-License Agreement
or the Joint Development Agreement, Sellers' obligations shall be deemed
limited solely to using the same, reasonable care and discretion as Sellers
use with their own similar Technology of like importance.

(vi) To the extent this Section 8.5 imposes obligations on Buyers to protect
the confidentiality of, or not to disclose, any Shared Technology, any Jointly
Owned Developed Technology (as defined in the Joint Development Agreement) or
any Technology licensed to Sellers or Buyers under the Cross-License Agreement
or the Joint Development Agreement, Buyers' obligations shall be deemed
limited solely to using the same, reasonable care and discretion as such
Buyers use with their own similar Technology of like importance.

8.6 Exclusivity. Sellers shall not, and shall cause their Subsidiaries and
their respective Affiliates, representatives, officers, employees, directors
and agents not to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate, consider,
entertain, encourage or accept the submission of any proposal or offer from
any Person (other than Buyers and their Affiliates in connection with the
Transactions) relating to the acquisition of the AirCard Business as a
separate and stand-alone acquisition or any portion of the Acquired Assets as
separate and distinct from the other assets of the Sellers (other than
Inventory in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice),
(b) participate in any discussions or negotiations (and as of the date hereof,
Sellers shall immediately cease any discussions or negotiations that are
ongoing) regarding, furnish any information with respect to, assist or
participate in, or facilitate in any other manner any effort or attempt by any
third party to do or seek any of the foregoing, or (c) furnish any
confidential information regarding the AirCard Business or the Acquired Assets
to any third party that is seeking to make, or has made, any such proposal or
offer. Sellers will notify Buyers promptly, and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours, if any third party makes any proposal, offer, inquiry or
contact with respect to any acquisition of the AirCard Business as a separate
and stand-alone acquisition or any portion of the Acquired Assets as separate
and distinct from the other assets of the Sellers (other than Inventory in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice). Sellers shall be
deemed to have breached the terms of this Section 8.6 if any of their
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, representatives, officers,
employees, directors or agents takes any action, whether in his or her
capacity as such or in any other capacity, that is prohibited by this Section
8.6. 

8.7 Public Statements. Except as required by Law, prior to the Closing,
neither Buyers, on the one hand, nor Sellers, on the other hand, shall,
without the prior written consent of the other, directly or indirectly make or
issue any statement or other communication to the public or any third party
regarding the subject matter of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Agreements, or the terms and conditions hereof or thereof, including, if
applicable, the termination of this Agreement and the reasons therefor, or any
disputes or arbitration proceedings hereunder or thereunder. The Parties shall
issue a mutually agreed joint press release on the date hereof. After the
Closing, except as required by Law, a Party hereto may issue any releases of
information without the consent of the other Party; provided, however, that
each such release is in compliance with the provisions of Section 8.5 and the
Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree
and acknowledge that US Buyer and Canadian Seller may be required to file this
Agreement and disclose the acquisition/divestiture of the AirCard Business in
its periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

8.8 Record Retention. Each Party agrees, on behalf of itself and its
controlled Affiliates, that for a period of not less than six (6) years
following the Closing Date, it shall not destroy or otherwise dispose of any
of the books and records relating to the Acquired Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities in its possession with respect to periods prior to the Closing.
Each Party shall have the right to destroy all or part of such books and
records after the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date or, at an
earlier time by giving each other party hereto twenty (20) days' prior written
notice of such intended disposition and by offering to deliver to the other
party, at the other Party's expense, custody of such books and records as such
first party may intend to destroy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a)
immediately after the Closing and if Sellers possess and can locate using
commercially reasonable efforts, Sellers shall deliver to Buyers or destroy
copies of Transferred Technology which is not licensed back to Sellers or
otherwise permitted to be retained by Sellers pursuant to Section 2.7(b), that
are in addition to copies delivered to Buyers as part of the Closing, whether
such copies are in paper form, on computer media or stored in another form,
and (b) immediately after the Closing and if Buyers possess and can locate
using commercially reasonable efforts, Buyers shall deliver to Sellers or
destroy copies of any Technology of Sellers or their Subsidiaries which is not
licensed to Buyers or necessary for Buyers to perform their obligations under
and during the term of the Transition Services Agreement, whether such copies
are in paper form, on computer media or stored in another form.

8.9 Bulk Sales. It will not be practicable to comply or to attempt to comply
with the procedures of the Uniform Commercial Code or other bulk sales laws or
similar laws of the jurisdiction in which the Acquired Assets to be conveyed
hereby are situated or of any other jurisdictions which may be asserted to be
applicable to the Transactions and the parties believe that it is not clear
that any such laws are applicable to such transaction. Accordingly, to induce
Buyers to waive any requirement for compliance on the part of Sellers with the
procedures of any such laws (which Buyers hereby waive), Sellers hereby agree
to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties, in accordance
with the provisions of Article 12, from and against, and to compensate and
reimburse the Buyer Indemnified Parties, in accordance with the provisions of
Article 12, for, any and all Losses arising out of or resulting from the
failure of Sellers to comply with or perform any actions in connection with
the provisions of any such law of any states or jurisdictions applicable to
the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyers agree to provide all
reasonable cooperation to Sellers in connection with obtaining bulk sales
exemptions in all jurisdictions where Sellers determine to seek such
exemption.



8.10 Business Relationships; Payments.

(a) Sellers shall provide reasonable cooperation at the expense of, and upon
the written request of, Buyers to assist in the transition of the business
relationships of the AirCard Business existing prior to the Closing, including
relationships with customers, suppliers and others.

(b) After the Closing, Sellers shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to,
as promptly as practicable, deliver, and if necessary endorse over to Buyers,
any cash, checks or other instruments of payment Sellers or any of their
Subsidiaries receive that relate to the Acquired Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities or the AirCard Business to which Buyers are entitled and shall
hold such cash, checks or other instruments of payment in trust for Buyers
until such delivery.

(c) After the Closing, Buyers shall, as promptly as practicable, deliver to
Sellers (or any of their Subsidiaries, as applicable) any mail and payments
received by Buyers that do not relate to the Acquired Assets or the AirCard
Business and to which Sellers or their Subsidiaries are entitled.

8.11 Carve-Out Financial Statements.

(a) In the event that, as a result of the consummation of the Transactions, US
Buyer is required to file Carve-Out Financial Statements with the SEC
(regardless of when such Carve-Out Financial Statements are required to be
filed with the SEC), then prior to the Closing (and as a condition to
consummation of the Transactions) Sellers shall prepare and deliver to Buyers
the Carve-Out Financial Statements. In addition, in the event that, at any
time following the Closing, US Buyer determines in good faith that it is
required to file with the SEC (or furnish to the SEC) any financial statements
of the AirCard Business (in addition to the Carve-Out Financial Statements)
under any U.S. Securities Laws (including as a result of actions taken by
Buyers, such as an offering of securities or the acquisition or one or more
businesses or other assets that, when aggregated with the AirCard Business,
require Buyers to file financial statements of the AirCard Business, either on
a stand-alone basis or consolidated with the financial statements of such
other businesses or assets), then Sellers shall, at the sole cost and expense
of Buyers, prepare and deliver to Buyers such financial statements of the
AirCard Business that US Buyer so determines are required to be filed or
furnished with the SEC, and any such financial statements of the AirCard
Business that are as of a fiscal year end or for a fiscal year shall be
audited and accompanied by an unqualified opinion of an internationally
recognized independent accounting firm. Any Carve-Out Financial Statements or
other financial statements of the AirCard Business prepared by Sellers
pursuant to this Section 8.11(a) shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP,
applied on a consistent basis, throughout the periods covered, shall present
fairly the financial condition of the AirCard Business as of the respective
dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows of the AirCard
Business for the periods covered thereby, and shall in all cases comply in all
respects with the U.S. Securities Laws that are applicable to US Buyer. For
the avoidance of doubt, none of the Parties or their respective Affiliates
shall be required to petition the SEC or its staff for an exemption from the
requirements of the Exchange Act in order to limit the requirements of the
Exchange Act relating to any requirement to file or furnish Carve-Out
Financial Statements or other financial statements of the AirCard Business in
connection with the Transactions.

(b) From and after the Closing, upon the request of US Buyer, Sellers shall
(i) use their reasonable best efforts to cause its independent accounting firm
to deliver to the SEC any auditor's consent that is required to be included in
any filing with the SEC that includes or incorporates by reference the Carve-
Out Financial Statements or other financial statements of the AirCard Business
prepared by Sellers pursuant to this Section 8.11(a) and (ii) to the extent US
Buyer conducts or intends to conduct an offering of securities (and if the
registration statement, prospectus or offering memorandum for such offering
includes 

or incorporates by reference the Carve-Out Financial Statements or other
financial statements of the AirCard Business prepared by Sellers pursuant to
this Section 8.11(a)), use their reasonable best efforts to cause their
independent accounting firm to deliver a letter containing statements and
information of the type ordinarily included in accountant's "comfort letters"
with respect to the Carve-Out Financial Statements or other financial
statements of the AirCard Business prepared by Sellers pursuant to this
Section 8.11(a) contained or incorporated by reference in any such document
relating to any such offering, in the case of each of clause (i) and (ii)
above, within the period reasonably requested by US Buyer. In addition, in
connection with any SEC filing required to be made by US Buyer (or any SEC
review of such filing), Sellers shall permit Buyers and their authorized
representatives to have reasonable access, during normal business hours and
upon reasonable advance notice, to the properties, books and records of
Sellers and their Affiliates relating to the AirCard Business for the purpose
of preparing any such SEC filing or responding to SEC questions, comments or
requests on such SEC filing, and to cause their Affiliates' and such
Affiliates' representatives to cooperate fully in such preparation or
response.

8.12 Other Actions Required to Be Taken.

(a) Buyers and Sellers shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
cause the Person identified on Section 8.12(a) of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule to enter into a Specified Agreement with US Buyer as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof. If the Person identified on Section 8.12(a)
of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule offers to enter into a Specified Agreement
with US Buyer for no additional consideration and subject to no additional
terms or conditions, US Buyer shall promptly enter into a Specified Agreement
with such Person.

(b) Sellers shall deliver a non-GAAP statement setting forth the amount of net
revenues and gross margin for each month, and the amount of inventory, accrued
warranty and marketing development fund liabilities as of each month end, for
the AirCard Business that are prepared in a manner consistent with the AirCard
Business Financial Statements within twenty (20) days after each month end
during the period between execution of this Agreement and the Closing Date.

(c) Sellers shall prepare and deliver (i) on or prior to the Closing Date, an
unaudited balance sheet of the AirCard Business as of December 31, 2011, (ii)
on or prior to March 1, 2013, unaudited financial statements of the AirCard
Business for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2012, including an
unaudited balance sheet of the AirCard Business as of December 31, 2012, and
(iii) as promptly as practicable following the end of each applicable
quarterly period, unaudited financial statements of the AirCard Business for
any quarterly period ending after the date hereof but prior to the Closing
Date. The financial statements required under (i) and (ii) above shall present
fairly the results of operations and financial condition of the AirCard
Business for the periods and as of the dates covered thereby, shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis, throughout
the periods covered, and (in the case of any income statements) shall be
delivered in the same format as the AirCard Business Financial Statements.

(d) Immediately following the Closing, Sellers shall deliver a letter to each
of the parties identified with a triple asterisk on Section 5.13(a) of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule, affirming that Sellers are responsible for any
indemnification obligations under the applicable Transferred Contract to the
extent they relate to AirCard Products sold or licensed prior to the Closing,
and requesting that such parties contact Sellers in respect of such
indemnification obligations. If, following the Closing, Buyers receive any
claim from such party that in whole, or in part, relates to an AirCard Product
sold or licensed prior to the Closing, Buyers promptly shall request that such
party contact Sellers in respect of such claim. 

(e) Sellers shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best
efforts to complete, as promptly as practicable, the development of the
AirVantage Management Services, as detailed in the ACMS Marketing Requirements
Document delivered by Sellers to Buyers on January 27, 2013 (the "ACMS
Marketing Requirements"), at no cost to Buyers. Sellers and their Subsidiaries
shall charge Buyers, per the terms of the ACMS Terms and Conditions, in form
and substance substantially the same as the version thereof delivered by
Sellers to Buyers on January 27, 2013 (the "ACMS Terms and Conditions"), for
any technical integration support, as identified on the ACMS Terms and
Conditions, for the AirVantage Management Services development provided after
the Closing by Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries to any Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries, at such Buyer's reasonable request. If any Buyer makes a
reasonable request for Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries to develop and
implement any new features and/or services for the AirVantage Management
Services not contemplated in the ACMS Marketing Requirements, Sellers agree to
negotiate with Buyers, in good faith, commercially reasonable terms and
conditions, including release schedule and applicable fees, for the
development and operation of such new features and services requested by
Buyers.

(f) The applicable Seller (or a Subsidiary thereof) and the applicable Buyer
(or a Subsidiary thereof) shall enter into a commercial agreement as promptly
as practicable after the date hereof (and shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to enter into such commercial agreement prior to the
Closing) for Sellers' provision to Buyers of the AirVantage Management
Services, in form and substance substantially the same as detailed in the ACMS
Marketing Requirements, (i) on terms and conditions that are substantially the
same as those provided in the ACMS Terms and Conditions, with such changes
thereto as are necessary to make the pricing, support offerings and service
levels for the AirVantage Management Services be no less favorable to Buyers
and their Subsidiaries than the pricing, support offerings and service levels
for the AirVantage Management Services provided to other customers using
substantially similar storage amounts and services of the AirVantage
Management Services, and (ii) on such other terms and conditions that are
substantially the same as those provided in the AirVantage Services Agreement,
in form and substance substantially the same as the version thereof delivered
by Sellers to Buyers on January 27, 2013, with such changes thereto as are
necessary to make such other terms and conditions for the AirVantage
Management Services (including the service offerings and availability) be no
less favorable to Buyers and their Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, than such
other terms and conditions for the AirVantage Management Services (including
the service offerings and availability) provided to other customers using
substantially similar storage amounts and services of the AirVantage
Management Services.

(g) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, Canadian Seller shall
transfer to the applicable Buyer (or a Subsidiary thereof) the license,
rights, covenant not to sue and privileges, provided under that certain patent
license and settlement agreement between Canadian Seller and the Person
identified on Section 8.12(g) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, solely with
respect to the AirCard Products listed in Section 5.24(a)(i) of the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule, and future, replacement and successor versions of or
natural extensions of such products (the "Transfer of Rights"). The Transfer
of Rights shall be "AS IS" without any representations or warranties by
Canadian Seller and shall be subject to the applicable terms and conditions
provided in such patent license and settlement agreement. Canadian Seller
acknowledges and agrees that under no circumstances shall Buyers or any of
their Subsidiaries be under any obligation to pay any amounts which may become
due under Section 3.1 of such patent license and settlement agreement, if any.

8.13 Cooperation Regarding Intellectual Property Matters. Following the
Closing, Buyers will have the right, but not the obligation to prosecute,
license, and enforce the Transferred Patents, and Sellers will have the right,
but not the obligation to prosecute, license, and enforce all Retained
Patents. However, (a) upon Buyers' reasonable request and at no charge to
Buyers, Sellers will reasonably cooperate with and 

assist Buyers in connection with (i) the prosecution, licensing, and
enforcement of the Transferred Patents and defending against any Patents
asserted against Buyers with respect to the AirCard Business, and (ii) third-
party licensing arrangements, including making reasonably available to Buyers,
upon reasonable advance notice, any employees retained by Sellers and their
Subsidiaries, and (b) upon Sellers' reasonable request and at no charge to
Sellers, Buyers will reasonably cooperate with and assist Sellers in
connection with (i) the prosecution, licensing, and enforcement of the
Retained Patents and defending against any Patents asserted against Sellers
with respect to the AirCard Business and/or the Retained Business, and (ii)
third-party licensing arrangements, including making reasonably available to
Sellers, upon reasonable advance notice, any Transferred Employees. The
obligations of Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyers, on the other hand, to
reasonably cooperate with and assist the other under this Section 8.13 are
intended by the Parties to be reasonably equal, including, specifically with
respect to the number of employees and employee man-hours to be provided.

ARTICLE 9 
EMPLOYEE MATTERS

9.1 Employment Offers

(a) Prior to the Closing, Buyers shall, or shall cause one of their
Subsidiaries to, extend a written offer of employment or service to each
Offered Employee (excluding for this purpose the Key Employees), in each case
effective as of the Closing, on the same or better terms as existed
immediately prior to the date hereof with respect to salary and on comparable
terms, in the aggregate, with respect to bonus and employee benefits (other
than long term equity incentives). Sellers shall have the right to review each
offer of employment or service made pursuant to this section prior to it being
sent to any Offered Employee. Such offer of employment or service shall
provide for an employee or independent contractor consideration period of one
(1) week, except in the case of any Offered Employee hired within one (1) week
of the Closing, in which case such offer shall provide for an employee or
independent contractor consideration period from the date of the offer until
the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the condition set
forth in Section 4.3(b)(vi) has not been satisfied at the end of such one
(1)-week period (or such shorter period, if applicable), then Buyer shall
extend the employee or independent contractor consideration period for one or
more one (1)-week periods until such condition is satisfied; provided however
that Buyers shall not be obligated to extend the consideration period past the
Outside Date. If Buyers, on the one hand, or Sellers, on the other hand,
reasonably believe in good faith that an Offered Employee intends to leave the
employ or service of Buyers or their Subsidiaries shortly after Closing, then
such party shall promptly notify the other party of such fact. For purposes of
determining eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits
where length of service is relevant under an employee benefit plan of Buyers
or any of their Subsidiaries (other than with respect to benefit accruals
under a defined benefit pension plan) and to the extent expressly not denied
under applicable Law, Buyers shall provide that the Offered Employees who are
employees immediately prior to the Closing shall receive service credit under
each employee benefit plan of Buyers or one of their Subsidiaries (other than
with respect to benefit accruals under a defined benefit plan) for their
period of service with Sellers prior to the Closing and, with respect to
Offered Employees who are employed by Canadian Seller immediately prior to the
Closing, shall recognize the past services of each such Offered Employees for
the purposes of severance entitlement (including notice of termination of
employment required under Employment Standards Act (B.C.)). Effective as of
the Closing, Buyers or one of their Subsidiaries shall hire and engage each
Offered Employee who accepts the offer of employment or service extended to
such Offered Employee pursuant to this section. If an Offered Employee does
not accept the offer of employment or service extended by Buyers or any of
their Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 9.1(a), then such Offered
Employee's employment or service shall be terminated by Sellers or their
Subsidiaries, as applicable, unless Buyers otherwise agree, effective as of
immediately prior to the Closing. 

Sellers shall provide all reasonable assistance to Buyers and their
Subsidiaries in connection with the offers of employment or service to the
Offered Employees contemplated by this section. Those Offered Employees who
accept employment or service from Buyers or one of their Subsidiaries pursuant
to the offers of employment or service made pursuant to this Section 9.1(a)
and commence employment or service with Buyers or one of their Subsidiaries as
of the Closing shall be referred to herein collectively as "Transferred
Employees". For the Offered Employees on approved leave of absence as set out
in Section 5.15(a)(ii) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, Buyers shall make
offers of employment effective upon the expiration of the leave of absence.

(b) Except as required by applicable Law, from and after the Closing the
Transferred Employees shall cease to participate in and/or accrue further
rights or benefits under any Employee Benefit Plan.

9.2 Sellers Payment of Pre-Closing Wages and Seller Benefit Plan
Contributions. Sellers, jointly and severally, shall pay all Wages earned or
owing up to the Closing Date in respect of all Transferred Employees at or no
later than thirty (30) days following the Closing Date. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Sellers, jointly and severally, shall pay or
provide to Transferred Employees all earned but untaken vacation pay and all
commissions, bonus and vested restricted stock units properly earned up to the
Closing Date. Sellers, jointly and severally, shall also pay all contributions
to Employee Benefit Plans due or owing up to the Closing Date in respect of
all Transferred Employees at or no later than thirty (30) days following the
Closing Date.

9.3 280G Information. Within ten (10) days after the date hereof, Sellers
shall deliver to Buyers a schedule setting forth (i) the name of each Offered
Employee that Sellers reasonably determine are "disqualified individuals"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, (ii) a determination of each
disqualified individual's "base amount" within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code, and (iii) the amount of cash compensation and information related to
the acceleration of any equity awards that will be paid or accelerated in
connection with such disqualified individual's termination of employment with
Sellers.

9.4 Buyers' 401(k) Plan. US Buyer shall ensure that the 401(k) plan sponsored
by it or one of its Affiliates in which the Transferred Employees who are
employees will participate after the Closing will accept a rollover
contribution of each such Transferred Employee's account balance from the
401(k) plan sponsored by US Seller or one of its Affiliates in accordance with
US Buyer's usual procedures.

9.5 No Third Party Beneficiaries. The Parties acknowledge and agree that all
provisions set forth in this Article 9 or any other provision of this
Agreement with respect to Offered Employees are included for the sole benefit
of the respective Parties and shall not create any right (a) in any other
Person, including any Offered Employees, any participant in any Employee
Benefit Plan or any beneficiary thereof, (b) to continued employment, either
before or after the Closing, with Sellers, Buyers or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or (c) to be construed to modify, amend or establish any benefit
plan, program or arrangement or in any way affect the ability of the Parties
hereto or any other Person to modify, amend or terminate any of its benefit
plans, programs or arrangements.

ARTICLE 10 
TAX MATTERS

10.1 Straddle Period. For purposes of this Agreement, any Taxes relating to
the Acquired Assets or the conduct or operation of the AirCard Business
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any income or gross receipts Tax) for
a Tax Period that includes, but does not end on, the Closing (a "Straddle
Period" and 

such Taxes, "Straddle Period Taxes") shall be apportioned between the
applicable Seller, on the one hand, and the applicable Buyer, on the other
hand, based on the portion of the period ending at 11:59 p.m. on the Closing
Date and the portion of the period beginning on the day after the Closing
Date, respectively. The amount of Taxes shall be allocated between portions of
a Straddle Period in the following manner: (a) in the case of a Tax imposed in
respect of property and that applies ratably to a Straddle Period, the amount
of Tax allocable to a portion of the Straddle Period shall be the total amount
of such Tax for the period in question multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the total number of days in such portion of such Straddle Period
and the denominator of which is the total number of days in such Straddle
Period, and (b) in the case of sales, value-added and similar transaction-
based Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes allocated under Section 10.2), such
Taxes shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period in which the
relevant transaction occurred. The Party required by Law to pay any such
Straddle Period Tax (the "Paying Party") shall prepare and the other Party
shall cooperate in the preparation and filing of such Tax Return. Any Tax
Return for Straddle Period Tax prepared by the Paying Party pursuant to this
section shall be made available to the other Party at least ten (10) Business
Days before such Tax Return is due to be filed. The Paying Party shall file
such Tax Return within the time period prescribed by Law and shall timely pay
such Straddle Period Tax. To the extent any such payment exceeds the
obligation of the Paying Party hereunder, the Paying Party shall provide the
other party (the "Non-Paying Party") with notice of payment details, within
ten (10) days of receipt of such notice of payment, the Non-Paying Party shall
reimburse the Paying Party for the Non-Paying Party's shares of such Straddle
Period Taxes.

10.2 Transfer Taxes. All sales, use, transfer, value-added, goods and
services, recording, ad valorem, privilege, documentary, gains, gross
receipts, registration, conveyance, excise, license, stamp, duties or similar
Taxes and fees ("Transfer Taxes") assessed in connection with the transfer of
the Acquired Assets pursuant to this Agreement, and that is not recoverable,
shall be borne one half by the relevant Buyer and one half by the relevant
Seller. The Party responsible for filing shall prepare any Tax Returns that
must be filed in connection with such Transfer Taxes at its own expense. The
Parties shall make reasonable best efforts to cooperate to the extent
necessary to obtain any such exemption or reduction of Transfer Taxes incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein.
Buyers shall pay to Sellers or Sellers shall pay to Buyers, as applicable,
half of any such Transfer Taxes actually recovered by such Party.

10.3 Tax Elections. If available, Canadian Buyer shall jointly execute with
Canadian Seller an election under subsection 167(1) of Part IX of the Excise
Tax Act (Canada) and any equivalent election provided under provincial Laws,
in the forms prescribed for such purposes, such that the sale of the Acquired
Assets sold by Canadian Seller to Canadian Buyer will take place without
payment of any GST or HST. Canadian Buyer shall register for GST and HST in
accordance with the Excise Tax Act (Canada) and shall file within the
prescribed filing period all forms supporting such election with the relevant
Tax Authority, together with its Tax Returns for the applicable reporting
periods during which the sale of the Acquired Assets contemplated herein
occurs. If the election contemplated in this Section 10.3 is not available,
Canadian Seller will charge GST, HST or relevant provincial sales tax as
required to those Buyers purchasing Acquired Assets sold by Canadian Seller in
respect of the Transactions undertaken by Canadian Seller and such Buyers, and
such Buyers will pay such amount to Canadian Seller at Closing. Canadian
Seller shall provide each Buyer subject to GST, HST or relevant provincial
sales tax with a valid Canadian tax invoice before such Buyer is required to
remit the respective tax to Canadian Seller.

10.4 Tax Characterization of Payments Under this Agreement. Sellers and Buyers
agree to treat all payments made either to or for the benefit of the other
Party under this Agreement (other than payment of the Purchase Price) as
adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and that such treatment
shall govern for purposes hereof to the extent permitted under applicable Tax
Law. 

10.5 Records. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.3 or Section 8.8,
(a) after the Closing Date, Buyers, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other
hand, will make available to the other, as reasonably requested, all
information, records or documents relating to Liability for Taxes with respect
to the Acquired Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, or the AirCard Business for
all periods prior to the Closing Date (including Straddle Periods), and will
preserve such information, records or documents until the expiration of any
applicable statute of limitations or extensions thereof, and (b) in the event
that any Party needs access to records in the possession of a second Party
relating to any of the Acquired Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the AirCard
Business for purposes of preparing Tax Returns or complying with any Tax audit
request, subpoena or other investigative demand by any Tax Authority, or for
any other legitimate Tax-related purpose not injurious to the second Party,
the second Party will allow representatives of the other Party access to such
records during regular business hours at the second Party's place of business
for the sole purpose of obtaining information for use as aforesaid and will
permit such other Party to make extracts and copies thereof as may be
necessary or convenient. The obligation to cooperate pursuant to this Section
10.5 shall terminate at the time the relevant applicable statute of
limitations expires (giving effect to any extension thereof).

ARTICLE 11

Agreement may be terminated and the Transactions abandoned at any time prior

Closing shall not have occurred on or before 11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on the
date which is 180 days following the date hereof; provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 11.1(b) shall not be

Agreement shall thereupon and forthwith become void and of no further force or
effect whatsoever, and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part
of Buyers, Sellers or their respective Affiliates or representatives in
connection herewith; provided, however, that no such termination shall relieve
any Party from Liability resulting from or arising out of any intentional
breach of such Party's representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
set forth herein or impair the right of any Party to compel specific
performance by the other Party of its obligations under this Agreement; and
provided further that the provisions of Section 8.5 (Confidentiality), Section
8.7 (Public Statements), this Section 11.2 and Article 13 shall remain in full

with:

(i) any Excluded Liabilities;

(b) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article 12, from and after

any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or by the waiver of any
condition. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any

reliance on any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement in order
for such Buyer Indemnified Party to be entitled to indemnification,

respect of Losses described in Section 12.2(a)(v), collectively shall be
limited in the aggregate to Four Million Dollars (US $4,000,000);

provided, however, that the limitations contained in this Section 12.3(b)(i),
Section 12.3(b)(ii), Section 12.3(b)(iii) and Section 12.3(b)(iv) shall not
apply to any breach of or inaccuracy in any Seller Fundamental Representation.

have been asserted but not resolved, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall seek
to recover amounts in respect of any claims for indemnification, compensation
or reimbursement under Section 12.2(a)(ii), Section 12.2(a)(iii) and Section
12.2(a)(vi) (but in the case of Section 12.2(a)(vi) solely in respect of any
Action relating to any matter of the type referred to in Section 12.2(a)(ii)
or Section 12.2(a)(iii)) from the Escrow Fund prior to seeking to recover
amounts in respect of such claims directly from Sellers; provided, however,
that to the extent any amounts are released from the Escrow Fund to any Buyer
Indemnified Party with respect to claims for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement that are not subject to the limitation set forth in Section
12.3(b)(i), such recovered amounts shall not reduce the amount that the Buyer
Indemnified Parties may recover with respect 

to claims for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement that are subject
to the limitation contained in Section 12.3(b)(i).

(e) All Losses shall be net of any third-party insurance proceeds which have
been paid in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of
indemnification, which proceeds shall be net of any related costs and
expenses, including the cost of pursuing any related insurance claims;
provided, however, that no Indemnified Party shall have any obligation to
pursue or recover any insurance claim in connection with any Losses sustained
by such Indemnified Party.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, (i) in the event that a particular matter
entitles a Buyer Indemnified Party to indemnification pursuant to more than
one clause of Section 12.2(a) or pursuant to any other Transaction Agreement,
such Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover a particular dollar
of Losses associated with such matter only once under this Article 12 and the
Transaction Agreements, and (ii) in the event that a particular matter
entitles a Seller Indemnified Party to indemnification pursuant to more than
one clause of Section 12.2(b) or pursuant to any other Transaction Agreement,
such Seller Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover a particular dollar
of Losses associated with such matter only once under this Article 12 and the
Transaction Agreements.

(g) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover any Losses
under Section 12.2(a)(ii) and Section 12.2(a)(vi) in each case in respect of
any breach of or inaccuracy in the Sufficiency Representation unless and until
the remediation process next described is complied with and fully implemented
and completed. In the event of any breach of or inaccuracy in the Sufficiency
Representation, the Parties shall work together promptly and diligently in a
cooperative and collaborative manner to address such breach or inaccuracy
through the addition of, or modification to, the services provided by Sellers
and their Subsidiaries under the Transition Services Agreement, or by the
transfer, for no additional consideration, of an asset (or assets) or property
(or properties) by Sellers and their Subsidiaries to Buyers or through such
other means as the Parties may agree. Any continuing failure to work in a
cooperative and collaborative manner shall be referred to the Chief Executive
Officers of the Canadian Seller and US Buyer for resolution. If resolution
satisfactory to Buyers, acting reasonably and in good faith, is not reached
within fifteen (15) Business Days of the date Buyers first notify Sellers, in
writing, of the breach or inaccuracy in the Sufficiency Representation, only
then may Buyers elect to pursue the indemnification remedies available in this
Article.

12.4 Indemnification Claims.

(a) If an Indemnified Party is of the opinion that it has or may have a right
to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under this Agreement (an
"Indemnification Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall so notify the
Indemnifying Party in a written notice (a "Claim Certificate"), prior to the
expiration of the applicable Survival Period (if applicable): (i) stating that
such Indemnified Party has directly or indirectly suffered or incurred any
Losses, or reasonably anticipates that it will directly or indirectly suffer
or incur any Losses, for which it is entitled to indemnification, compensation
or reimbursement under this Agreement; (ii) a brief description in reasonable
detail (to the extent available to such Indemnified Party) of the facts,
circumstances or events giving rise to each item of Losses based on such
Indemnified Party's good faith belief thereof; and (iii) the basis for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under this Agreement to which
such item of Losses is related.

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall seek to contest any matter
set forth in a Claim Certificate, the Indemnifying Party shall so notify the
Indemnified Party in writing within thirty (30) days after receipt of such
Claim Certificate, which notice shall set forth a brief description in
reasonable 

detail of the Indemnifying Party's basis for objecting to such matter. In the
event that the Indemnifying Party shall fail to object to any matter set forth
in a Claim Certificate within the foregoing thirty (30)-day period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have irrevocably agreed and consented to
indemnify, compensate and reimburse the Indemnified Party in respect of such
items of Loss pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

12.5 Third Party Claims. In the event any claim, demand, complaint or Action
is instituted by a third party against an Indemnified Party which involves or
appears reasonably likely to involve an Indemnification Claim hereunder (a
"Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall, promptly after receipt of
notice of any such Third Party Claim, notify the Indemnifying Party of the
commencement thereof; provided, however, that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party of the commencement of any such Third Party Claim will
relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability in connection therewith only if
and to the extent that such failure caused damages, for which the Indemnified
Party is obligated, which are greater than the damages would have been had the
Indemnified Party given the Indemnifying Party prompt notice hereunder. Upon
receipt of such notice, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, in its
sole discretion, to control the defense or settlement of such Third Party
Claim by appointing a recognized and reputable counsel acceptable to the
Indemnified Party to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense;
provided that prior to the Indemnifying Party assuming control of such defense
it shall first verify to the Indemnified Party in writing that the
Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for all liabilities and obligations
relating to such Third Party Claim up to the limitations set forth in Section
12.3 and subject to such limitations. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this Section 12.5:

(a) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose;
provided that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by
the Indemnified Party (other than any reasonable fees and expenses of such
separate counsel that are incurred prior to the date the Indemnifying Party
effectively assumes control of such defense which, notwithstanding the
foregoing, shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party, and except that the
Indemnifying Party shall pay all of the reasonable fees and expenses of such
separate counsel if the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that a
reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party);

(b) notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 12.5(c), the
Indemnifying Party shall control the defense or settlement of any Third Party
Claim by appointing counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party to
be the lead counsel in connection with such defense (i) to the extent such
Third Party Claim is described in Section 2.4(m) or (ii) if such Third Party
Claim is listed on Section 2.4(o) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule;

(c) except as provided in Section 12.5(b), the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume control of the defense of any Third Party Claim (unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by the Indemnified Party) and shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if:
(i) the claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal or quasi criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation; (ii) the Indemnified Party reasonably
believes an adverse determination with respect to the Third Party Claim would
be detrimental to or injure the Indemnified Party's reputation, business,
operations or future business prospects in a material respect; (iii) the claim
seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, or is
an Action before the United States International Trade Commission; (iv) the
amount of Losses reasonably estimated to be incurred pursuant to such Third
Party Claim (when combined with all other outstanding claims for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement and any amount previously paid
by the Indemnifying Party that applies toward the applicable cap under Section
12.3 (if any) would exceed the applicable cap contemplated by Section 12.3 (if
any)); (v) the claim relates to a breach or alleged breach 

of or inaccuracy or alleged inaccuracy in Section 5.4 (Title) or Section 5.12
(Intellectual Property); (vi) the claim is made by a customer of the AirCard
Business; (vii) the claim is in respect of a Specified Matter; or (viii) the
claim is in respect of the matters described in Section 12.2(a)(v); provided
that the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not
control) the defense of such Third Party Claim (and any and all settlement
discussions related to such Third Party Claim) and to employ, at its sole
expense, separate counsel of its choice to advise the Indemnifying Party for
such purpose;

(d) if the Indemnifying Party shall control the defense of any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party may not settle or otherwise resolve such claim
or cease to defend such claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) unless (i) prior to the Indemnifying Party entering
into such settlement or ceasing to defend such claim, the Indemnifying Party
first verifies to the Indemnified Party in writing that the Indemnifying Party
shall be responsible for all liabilities and obligations relating to such
Third Party Claim, (ii) such settlement or cessation involves, with respect to
the Indemnified Party, only the payment of a lump sum amount of money and the
Indemnifying Party pays such lump sum amount of money when due, and (iii) such
settlement expressly and unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party from
all Liabilities with respect to such claim, with prejudice; and

(e) in the event the Indemnified Party controls the defense of any Third Party
Claim, it shall request the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party
before entering into any settlement of such claim or ceasing to defend such
claim; provided, that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to settle or
cease to defend such claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, and the failure of the Indemnifying Party to provide such
prior written consent shall not impair or otherwise limit any of the
Indemnified Party's rights to indemnification, compensation and reimbursement
hereunder. If the Indemnified Party settles any Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, then neither the decision to
settle nor the settlement amount shall be conclusive evidence of, or give rise
to any presumption of the commercial reasonableness of, the terms of the
settlement or the commercial reasonableness of the amount of indemnifiable
Losses relating thereto, and any claim for indemnification, reimbursement or
compensation brought by the Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party
under this Article 12 with respect to the settlement of such Third Party Claim
will be subject to the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section
13.11.

12.6 Tax Treatment. All indemnity payments made pursuant to this Agreement
shall be treated for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the Adjusted Cash
Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

12.7 Mitigation. Each of the Parties acknowledges that under applicable
principles of common law in the State of Delaware, a party may have a duty to
mitigate damages and losses arising out of a breach of contract under certain
circumstances. This Agreement is not intended to, and does not, expand upon,
or extend in any manner, any such duty or other similar obligation.

13.2 Amendments and Waivers. Subject to applicable Law, any provision of this
Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver
is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each of the
Parties, or, in the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is
to be effective. No course of dealing and no failure or delay on the part of
any Party hereto in exercising any right, power or remedy conferred by this
Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise prejudice such
party's rights, powers and remedies. The failure of any of the Parties to this
Agreement to require the performance of a term or obligation under this
Agreement or the waiver by any of the Parties to this Agreement of any breach
hereunder shall not prevent subsequent enforcement of such term or obligation 

or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach hereunder. No single or partial
exercise of any right, power or remedy conferred by this Agreement shall
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy.

13.3 Successors and Assigns. All covenants and agreements and other provisions
set forth in this Agreement and made by or on behalf of either Party shall
bind and inure to the benefit of the successors, heirs and permitted assigns
of such party, whether or not so expressed. Neither Party may assign or
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the
consent in writing of the other Party, except that, without the consent of the
other Party: (a) Buyers may assign their rights and obligations hereunder
(including their right to purchase the Acquired Assets), in whole or in part,
to any Affiliate, (b) either Party may assign their rights and obligations
pursuant to this Agreement, in whole or in part, to an entity that succeeds to
all or substantially all of the business of such Party (whether by sale of
stock, sale of assets, merger, recapitalization, business combination or
otherwise) and (c) either Party may assign any or all of its rights pursuant
to this Agreement, and each of the other agreements and instruments
contemplated hereby, including its rights to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement, to any of its lenders as collateral security.

13.4 Severability. In the event that any one or more of the provisions of this
Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any
reason in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of any
such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions hereof
shall not be in any way impaired or affected (so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party), it being intended that each Parties' rights and privileges
shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, and
any such invalidity, illegality and unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other
jurisdiction (so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions
is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party).

13.5 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, each of Sellers, on the
one hand, and Buyers, on the other hand, shall pay all of their own respective
fees, costs and expenses (including fees, costs and expenses of legal counsel,
investment bankers, brokers and other representatives and consultants)
incurred in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement, the performance
of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation of the
Transactions. Losses suffered by a Party for a breach of this Agreement shall
in no way be limited by the amounts described in this Section 13.5.

13.6 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions (without proof of damages) to prevent actual or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity and the Parties hereby agree to waive any
requirements for posting a bond in connection with any such action.

13.7 Other Remedies. Except to the extent set forth otherwise herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.



13.8 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as specifically set forth or
referred to herein, nothing herein expressed or implied is intended or shall
be construed to confer upon or give to any Person any rights or remedies under
or by reason of this Agreement or any other certificate, document, instrument
or agreement executed in connection herewith nor be relied upon other than the
Parties hereto and their permitted successors or assigns. The representations
and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the
Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties in accordance with and
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and are not necessarily
intended as characterization of actual facts or circumstances as of the date
of this Agreement or as of any earlier date.

13.9 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule (and all schedules thereto) and all Schedules to this Agreement, and
all other agreements referred to herein is complete, and all promises,
representations, understandings, warranties and agreements with reference to
the subject matter hereof, and all inducements to the making of this Agreement
relied upon by all the Parties hereto, have been expressed herein or in such
Sellers Disclosure Schedule, Schedules or such other agreements and this
Agreement, including such Sellers Disclosure Schedule, Schedules and such
other agreements supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or among the Parties, written or oral, to the extent that
they related in any way to the subject matter hereof.

13.10 Governing Law. This Agreement, including the validity hereof and the
rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder, shall be construed in
accordance with and governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable
to contracts made and to be performed entirely in such state without giving
effect to the conflicts of Laws principles thereof.

13.11 Dispute Resolution

(a) As used in this Agreement, "Dispute" shall mean any dispute or
disagreement between Buyers and Sellers concerning the interpretation of this
Agreement, the validity of this Agreement, any breach or alleged breach by any
Party under this Agreement, any claim for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement under Article 12 or any other matter relating in any way to this
Agreement; provided, however, that "Dispute" shall not include any dispute
which is subject to the procedures set forth in Section 3.2 or in which a
Party seeks equitable relief (including pursuant to Section 13.6).

(b) If a Dispute arises, the parties to the Dispute shall follow the
procedures set forth in this Section 13.11.

(c) The Parties shall promptly attempt in good faith to resolve any Dispute by
negotiations between Buyers and Sellers. Buyers and Sellers shall meet at a
mutually acceptable time and place within twenty (20) calendar days after
delivery of such notice, and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem
necessary to exchange relevant information and to attempt to resolve the
Dispute in good faith.

(d) If a Dispute is not resolved by negotiation pursuant to Section 13.11(c),
the Parties agree that such Dispute and any other claims arising out of or
relating to this Agreement (other than any dispute which is subject to the
procedures set forth in Section 3.2 or in which a Party seeks equitable relief
(including pursuant to Section 13.6)) shall be heard, adjudicated and
determined exclusively and only by final and binding arbitration conducted by
JAMS in Los Angeles, California, in accordance with the JAMS rules and
procedures. The Parties further understand and agree that this Agreement
evidences a transaction involving commerce within the understanding of 9
U.S.C. Section 2, and that this Agreement shall therefore be governed by the
Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1, et seq. 

(e) Notwithstanding any statute or rule governing limitations of actions, any
arbitration relating to or arising from any Dispute shall be commenced by
service of an arbitration demand.

(f) To commence an arbitration pursuant to this Agreement, a Party shall serve
a written arbitration demand (the "Demand") on the other Party in accordance
with this Agreement and at the same time submit a copy of the Demand to JAMS,
together with a check payable to JAMS in the amount of that entity's then-
current arbitration filing fee; provided that in no event shall the claimant
be required to pay an arbitration filing fee exceeding the sum then required
to file a civil action in the United States District Court for Central
District of California. The claimant shall attach a copy of this Agreement to
the Demand, which shall also describe the Dispute in sufficient detail to
advise the respondent of the nature of the Dispute, state the date on which
the Dispute first arose, list the names and addresses of every Person whom the
claimant believes does or may have information relating to the Dispute, and
state the relief requested by the claimant, including a monetary amount, if
the claimant seeks a monetary award of any kind. Within thirty (30) days after
receiving the Demand, the respondent shall mail to the claimant a written
response to the Demand (the "Response"), and submit a copy of the Response to
JAMS, together with a check for the difference, if any, between the filing fee
paid by the claimant and JAMS' then-current arbitration filing fee. The
Response shall describe the Dispute in sufficient detail to fairly inform the
claimant of the respondent's position in the matter, list the names and
addresses of every Person whom the respondent believes does or may have
information relating to the Dispute, and, if the respondent has asserted a
counterclaim, state with particularity the relief requested by the respondent,
including a specific monetary amount, if the respondent seeks a monetary award
of any kind.

(g) Promptly after service of the Response, the Parties shall confer in good
faith to attempt to agree upon a suitable arbitrator. If the Parties are
unable to agree upon an arbitrator, JAMS shall select the arbitrator, based,
if possible, on his or her expertise with respect to the subject matter of the
Dispute.

(h) Notwithstanding the choice-of-law principles of any jurisdiction, the
arbitrator shall be bound by and shall resolve all Disputes in accordance with
the substantive law of the State of Delaware, federal law as enunciated by the
federal courts situated in the District of Delaware, and all federal rules
relating to the admissibility of evidence, including, without limitation, all
relevant privileges and the attorney work product doctrine.

(i) Before the arbitration hearing, each Party shall be entitled to take a
discovery deposition of up to three (3) representatives of the opposing Party
who has knowledge of the matters in Dispute. In addition, upon the application
of a Party showing good cause for the taking of a deposition intended to
preserve evidence for introduction at trial, the arbitrator shall enter such
orders as may be necessary to permit the preservation of such Person or
Person(s) and such deposition(s) shall not count with respect to any limit
imposed by agreement or otherwise on the number of discovery depositions
allowed to be taken in connection with the arbitration. Further, upon the
written request of either Party, the other Party shall promptly produce
documents relevant to the Dispute or reasonably likely to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence. The manner, timing and extent of any further
discovery shall be committed to the arbitrator's sound discretion, provided
that under no circumstances shall the arbitrator allow more depositions or
interrogatories than permitted by the presumptive limitations set forth in
F.R.Civ.P. 30(a)(2)(A) and 22(a). The arbitrator shall levy appropriate
sanctions, including an award of reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party
that fails to cooperate in good faith in discovery permitted by this Section
13.11(i) or ordered by the arbitrator.

(j) Within thirty (30) days after the arbitration hearing is closed, the
arbitrator shall issue a written award setting forth his or her decision and
the reasons thereof. If a Party prevails on a statutory 

claim that affords the prevailing Party the right to recover attorneys' fees
and/or costs, then the arbitrator shall award to the Party that substantially
prevails in the arbitration its costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees. The arbitrator's award shall be final, nonappealable and
binding upon the Parties, subject only to the provisions of 9 U.S.C. Section
10, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The arbitrator shall have authority to award any remedy or relief that a court
of the State of California could order or grant, including specific
performance of any obligation created under this Agreement, the issuance of an
injunction, or the imposition of sanctions for abuse or frustration of the
arbitration process. The arbitrator shall award reasonable attorneys' fees,
costs, and expert witness fees to the prevailing Party.

13.12 Consent to Jurisdiction. Subject to Section 13.11, and without limiting
the other provisions of this Section 13.12, the Parties hereto agree that any
legal proceeding by or against any Party hereto or with respect to or arising
out of this Agreement shall be brought in the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware located within New Castle County. Subject to Section 13.11, by
execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Party hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts solely
for the purposes of disputes arising under this Agreement and not as a general
submission to such jurisdiction or with respect to any other dispute, matter
or claim whatsoever. The Parties hereto irrevocably consent to the service of
process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or
proceeding by the delivery of copies thereof by overnight courier to the
address for such party to which notices are deliverable hereunder. Any such
service of process shall be effective upon delivery. Nothing herein shall
affect the right to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable
Law. The Parties hereto hereby waive any right to stay or dismiss any action
or proceeding under or in connection with this Agreement brought before the
foregoing courts on the basis of (a) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason, or that
it or any of its property is immune from the above-described legal process,
(b) that such action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that
venue for the action or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement may not
be enforced in or by such courts, or (c) any other defense that would hinder
or delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which any Party
hereto is entitled pursuant to any final judgment of any court having
jurisdiction.

13.13 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

13.14 Counterparts. This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument
entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments hereto or
thereto, may be executed in two or more counterparts and by the different
Parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and
delivered shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same instrument. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by
means of a fax machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic Delivery") shall be treated
in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and shall be
considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party hereto shall raise the
use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature or agreement or







instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of Electronic
Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each such party
forever waives any such defense, except to the extent that such defense
relates to lack of authenticity.
