(C) other  than  obtaining or making, as applicable, any other consents,
approvals, orders,  authorizations, registrations, declarations or filings

of, and there has been no event, condition  or occurrence which, after notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute  such a default or violation of,
or permit the termination of, any term,  condition or provision of (i) its

directly or indirectly arising or relating  to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.

 

 

Section  5.3 _Entire  Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_

 

 

This  Agreement  constitutes the entire agreement between and among the
parties hereto pertaining  to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all
prior agreements,  understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral
or written, of the  parties, and there are no warranties, representations or
other agreements  between or among the parties in connection with the subject
matter hereof except  as set forth specifically herein or contemplated
hereby. No supplement,  modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be
binding unless executed in  writing by the party to be bound thereby. The
failure of a party to exercise  any  right or remedy shall not be deemed or
constitute a waiver of such right or  remedy in the future. No waiver of any
of the provisions of this Agreement  shall  be deemed or shall constitute a
waiver of any other provision hereof (regardless  of whether similar), nor
shall any such waiver constitute a continuing waiver  unless otherwise
expressly provided.

 

 

Section  5.4 _Binding  Effect  and Assignment_

 

 

This  Agreement  shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their  respective permitted successors and assigns.
Nothing in this Agreement, express  or implied, is intended to confer upon
any person other than the parties hereto  and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any rights, benefits  or  obligations hereunder. No
party hereto may assign, transfer, dispose of or  otherwise alienate this
Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations  under this
Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise). Any attempted 
assignment, transfer, disposition or alienation in violation of this
Agreement  shall be null, void and ineffective.

 

 

Section  5.5 _Severability_

 

 

If  any term or  other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or
incapable of being  enforced by any rule of applicable Law, or public policy,
all other conditions  and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and  effect so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions  contemplated herein are not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any  party hereto. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is  invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall  negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original  intent of the parties hereto as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable  manner in order that the transactions
contemplated herein are consummated as  originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible.

 

 

Section  5.6 _Execution_

 

 

This  Agreement may  be executed in multiple counterparts each of which
shall be deemed an original  and all of which shall constitute one
instrument.
