MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT

THIS MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of July 31, 2013, by and between CATAMARAN LLC, a Texas
limited liability company (the "Buyer"), and THE F. DOHMEN CO., a Wisconsin
corporation ("Dohmen"). Buyer and Dohmen are sometimes referred to
collectively as the "Parties" and individually as a "Party." Except as
otherwise set forth herein, capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meaning specified in Appendix A.

RECITALS

WHEREAS, Dohmen owns all of the outstanding limited liability company
interests, including capital, profits and voting interests (the "Membership
Interests"), of RESTAT, LLC, a Wisconsin limited liability company ("RESTAT");

WHEREAS, RESTAT is in the business of pharmaceutical benefits management
services, including providing adjudication of claims on behalf of employers,
managed healthcare plans, workers' compensation plans, HMOs, insurance
companies, Medicaid, government plans and unions, providing a network of
pharmacies throughout the United States and certain territories of the United
States for the dispensing of prescriptions, providing and/or administering
prescription savings programs, including prescription savings cards and
related services, and the aggregation of claims to secure manufacturer rebates
(the "Business");

WHEREAS, Buyer desires to acquire RESTAT and its Business; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Dohmen has determined that the transactions
contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interests of Dohmen and its
shareholders and, in furtherance thereof, has approved and adopted this
Agreement and agreed to effect the sale of RESTAT on the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, based upon the above premises and in consideration of the
mutual promises set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the Parties, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

PURCHASE AND SALE OF MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS

1.1 Agreement to Purchase and Sell Membership Interests. On the terms and
subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement, at the Closing, Buyer
shall purchase from Dohmen, and Dohmen shall sell, transfer and assign to
Buyer, all of the Membership Interests, free and clear of all Encumbrances.

1.2 Purchase Price. In consideration of the Membership Interests, Buyer shall
pay Dohmen an aggregate purchase price (the "Purchase Price") equal to:

(a) four hundred nine million five hundred thousand dollars ($409,500,000);
minus



(b) the aggregate amount of all Closing Date Indebtedness; plus

(c) the amount, if any, by which Closing Date Working Capital exceeds zero
dollars ($0) ("Target Working Capital"); minus

(d) the amount, if any, by which Target Working Capital exceeds Closing Date
Working Capital; minus

(e) the aggregate amount of all unpaid RESTAT Transaction Costs as of
immediately prior to the Closing.

1.3 Closing Date Balance Sheet; Determination of Indebtedness and Working
Capital. The amounts of Closing Date Indebtedness and Closing Date Working
Capital shall each be determined from a balance sheet (the "Closing Date
Balance Sheet") of RESTAT prepared as of 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date (the "Valuation Time"). For purposes of measuring
the carrying value of any element reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet,
the assets and liabilities of RESTAT will be presented as though the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement had not occurred. The Closing Date
Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with the Agreed Accounting
Principles. The Closing Date Working Capital shall be calculated from the
Closing Date Balance Sheet. Buyer shall deliver the Closing Date Balance
Sheet, and Buyer's proposed calculation of the Closing Date Indebtedness,
Closing Date Working Capital and the Buyer's proposed calculation of the
resulting Purchase Price (the "Adjustment Calculation") to Dohmen not more
than ninety (90) days following the Closing Date. "Delivery Date" means the
date on which the Closing Date Balance Sheet is so delivered. Buyer and Dohmen
shall, throughout the entire period starting on the Closing Date and ending on
the expiration of the Dispute Period (as defined in Section 1.4(a), below),
reasonably cooperate regarding any and all financial and business matters
relating to the preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the
Adjustment Calculation. Buyer shall grant Dohmen and its representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours, to RESTAT's and Buyer's
personnel, and reasonable access to and copies of RESTAT's books, records,
ledgers, journals and other financial records and information, including work
papers, trial balances, worksheets, notes and schedules, to the extent related
to the preparation or review of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the
proposed Adjustment Calculation, used in or helpful to the preparation or
review of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the proposed Adjustment
Calculation, in each case as may be reasonably requested by Dohmen to assure
that the Adjustment Calculation has been accurately calculated in accordance
with this Section 1.3.

1.4 Disputes Regarding Closing Date Balance Sheet. Disputes with respect to
the Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be resolved as follows:

(a) General. Dohmen shall have thirty (30) days after the Delivery Date (the
"Dispute Period") to dispute any of the elements of or amounts reflected on
the Closing Date Balance Sheet or the proposed Adjustment Calculation (a
"Dispute"). Written notice of a Dispute shall be given by Dohmen to Buyer
within such 30-day period (a "Dispute Notice") and shall specify (to the
extent known) the item or items in dispute. If Dohmen does not give Buyer a
Dispute Notice within the Dispute Period, the Closing Date Balance Sheet and
proposed Adjustment Calculation shall be treated as if they had been accepted
and agreed to by Dohmen in the form in which they were delivered by Buyer, and
shall be final and binding upon the Parties hereto. If a



Dispute Notice is so delivered within the Dispute Period, Buyer and Dohmen
shall attempt in good faith for a period of twenty (20) days (or such longer
period as Buyer and Dohmen may mutually agree) from the date of delivery of
the Dispute Notice to resolve the Dispute and agree in writing upon the final
content of the disputed Closing Date Balance Sheet, and the resulting
Adjustment Calculation or to stipulate to such portion thereof with respect to
which there is no dispute.

(b) Arbitrating Accountant. If Buyer and Dohmen are unable to resolve any
Dispute within the aforesaid 20-day period, Dohmen and Buyer shall jointly
engage a nationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually agreed
upon by Dohmen and Buyer (the "Arbitrating Accountant") as arbitrator. In the
event that Dohmen and Buyer are unable to agree upon the Arbitrating
Accountant after consulting with the other in good faith for a 15-day period,
then the Arbitrating Accountant shall be selected pursuant to the Special
Arbitration (as hereinafter defined). In connection with the resolution of any
Dispute, the Arbitrating Accountant shall have reasonable access to all
documents, ledgers, journals, records, work papers, trial balances,
worksheets, facilities and personnel of RESTAT which relate to, or which the
Arbitrating Accountant reasonably requests in connection with its review and
consideration of, the Closing Date Balance Sheet, or portion thereof in
Dispute, and reasonably necessary to perform its function as arbitrator. The
Arbitrating Accountant's sole function shall be to decide the accounting
issues that are the subject of the Dispute, and only the accounting issues
that are the subject of the Dispute, in accordance with the requirements of
Section 1.4 hereof. The Arbitrating Accountant shall allow Dohmen and Buyer to
present their respective positions regarding the Dispute. The Arbitrating
Accountant may, at its discretion, conduct a conference concerning the
Dispute, at which conference each Party shall have the right to present
witnesses and additional documents, materials and other information and to
have present its advisors, counsel and accountants. In connection with such
process, there shall be no other hearings or any oral examinations, testimony,
depositions, discovery or other similar proceedings. The Arbitrating
Accountant shall thereafter promptly render its decision on the question in
writing and finalize the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the resulting
Adjustment Calculation to reflect the resolution of all Disputes. Such written
determination shall be final and binding upon the Parties hereto (absent
manifest error), and judgment may be entered on the award. The fees and
expenses of the Arbitrating Accountant shall be shared between Dohmen and
Buyer so that Dohmen's aggregate share of such fees and expenses shall be
equal to the product of (i) and (ii), where (i) is the aggregate amount of
such fees and expenses, and where (ii) is a fraction, the numerator of which
is the amount in dispute that is ultimately unsuccessfully disputed by Dohmen
(as determined by the Arbitrating Accountant), and the denominator of which is
the total amount disputed by Dohmen. "Special Arbitration" means expedited
arbitration: (i) before a single arbitrator in Milwaukee, Wisconsin conducted
by an alternative dispute resolution organization mutually agreed by the
Parties hereto in accordance with its own rules and procedures or as may be
mutually agreed by the Parties or, if the Parties hereto are unable to
mutually agree on such organization, by the American Arbitration Association
pursuant to its Commercial Arbitration Rules and Expedited Procedures; (ii)
the scope of which is limited solely to selecting the Arbitrating Accountant
contemplated by this Section 1.4(b) (as distinguished from resolving any
Dispute); and (iii) in which the arbitrator's award is final and binding and
conclusive on the Parties and may be enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction.

(c) Final Purchase Price. The Adjustment Calculation, whether in the form (i)
originally proposed by Buyer with no objection by Dohmen within the aforesaid
30-day Dispute



Period, (ii) in the form as so finally agreed by Buyer and Dohmen following a
timely delivery of a Dispute Notice by Dohmen, or (iii) in the form as so
finally determined by the Arbitrating Accountant, shall be the final and
binding Adjustment Calculation (the "Final Adjustment Calculation"), and the
resulting Purchase Price derived therefrom (the "Final Purchase Price") shall
be the final and binding Purchase Price for all purposes under this Agreement.

1.5 Closing Purchase Price Estimate; Payment at Closing.

(a) Estimate. For purposes of the Closing, Dohmen shall make a good-faith
estimate of the Purchase Price, including Closing Date Indebtedness, unpaid
RESTAT Transaction Costs, Closing Date Working Capital and resulting Final
Adjustment Calculation (the "Closing Purchase Price Estimate"), based upon the
most recent ascertainable financial information of RESTAT, which estimates
shall be reasonably acceptable to Buyer. The Closing Purchase Price Estimate
shall be prepared in accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles. The
Closing Purchase Price Estimate, including each component thereof, shall be
set forth in a written certificate, duly executed by the Chief Financial
Officer of RESTAT (the "Closing Estimate Certificate") and delivered by Dohmen
to Buyer at least five (5) days prior to the Closing Date.

(b) Payment. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay the Closing Purchase Price
Estimate by wire transfer of immediately available funds as follows:

(i) thirty million dollars ($30,000,000) (the "Escrowed Funds") shall be paid
to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, who shall
hold the same in escrow to secure Dohmen's obligations to (A) make any
adjustment required of Dohmen pursuant to Section 1.6(b) hereof, and (B)
indemnify Buyer pursuant to Article VIII hereof; and

(ii) the balance of the Closing Purchase Price Estimate, reduced by the
deductions pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 1.5(b), shall be paid to
Dohmen.

(c) Transaction Costs. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay, or shall cause RESTAT
to pay, the amount of the RESTAT Transaction Costs described in Section 1.2(e)
to the appropriate Persons entitled thereto in accordance with invoices or
payoff letters provided by Dohmen to Buyer at least three (3) days prior to
the Closing.

(d) Wire Transfer Instructions. Wire transfer of each payment described in
this Section 1.5 shall be made in accordance with written payment instructions
delivered to Buyer by Dohmen and/or the Escrow Agent at least three (3) days
prior to the Closing Date.

1.6 Payment of Final Purchase Price. Following the Closing, the Parties shall
determine the Final Purchase Price, taking into account the Final Adjustment
Calculation and following the procedures established in Sections 1.2 through
and including 1.4. If, based on the Final Purchase Price:

(a) the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Closing Purchase Price Estimate,
Buyer shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) days of the
determination of the Final Purchase Price) pay an aggregate amount equal to
such excess to Dohmen; or



(b) the Closing Purchase Price Estimate exceeds the Final Purchase Price,
Dohmen shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) days of the
determination of the Final Purchase Price) pay an aggregate amount equal to
such excess to Buyer. If Dohmen fails to pay such amount within such five-day
time period, Buyer shall be entitled to recover such amount from the Escrowed
Funds and the Parties, in such event, shall execute joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent to that effect. In the event that Buyer recovers such
amount from the Escrowed Funds, Dohmen shall promptly (but in any event within
five (5) days of the date of such joint written instruction) deposit cash in
the Escrowed Funds in an amount equal to the amount released from the Escrowed
Funds to Buyer pursuant to this Section 1.6(b).

Any amount required to be paid pursuant to Section 1.6(a) or (b) shall be
paid, together with interest on such payment from the date such payment
described in either the foregoing clauses (a) or (b) is due to the date of
payment, at six percent (6%) per annum. Any payment made pursuant to this
Section 1.6 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds
pursuant to wire transfer instructions furnished by Dohmen (if the payment is
to Dohmen) or by Buyer (if the payment is to Buyer).

1.7 Time and Place of Closing. The transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be consummated (the "Closing") at 10:00 a.m., at the offices
of Michael Best and Friedrich LLP, 100 East Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 3300,
Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202, on October 1, 2013, or, if by such date any of the
conditions to Closing set forth in Article VII (other than those which, by
their nature, are to be satisfied at Closing, but subject to such satisfaction
of all such conditions) have not been satisfied or waived by the Party
entitled to the benefit thereof, then (subject to Section 9.1(b) hereof) on
the first Monday following the satisfaction or waiver of all such outstanding
conditions, or on such other date, or at such other time or place, or in such
other manner (such as an electronic closing with documents and signatures
transmitted electronically or by facsimile) as shall be mutually agreed upon
by Dohmen and Buyer. The date on which the Closing occurs in accordance with
the preceding sentence is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date."

1.8 Allocation of the Purchase Price.

(a) Within sixty (60) days following the calculation of the Final Purchase
Price pursuant to Section 1.4, Buyer shall deliver to Dohmen a schedule (the
"Preliminary Allocation Schedule") allocating the Purchase Price (which for
this purpose shall be deemed to include any Liabilities properly taken into
account pursuant to Section 1001 of the Code) among the assets of RESTAT. The
Preliminary Allocation Schedule shall be reasonable and shall be prepared in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder. If, within ten (10) days following receipt of the Preliminary
Allocation Schedule, Dohmen does not notify Buyer in writing of its
disagreement with the Preliminary Allocation Schedule, the Preliminary
Allocation Schedule shall be final and binding. If, within such ten (10)-day
period, Dohmen so notifies Buyer, Dohmen and Buyer shall endeavor to resolve
such disagreement, and if they are able to do so shall make such revisions to
the Preliminary Allocation Schedule to reflect such resolution, which as
revised shall be final and binding. The Preliminary Allocation Schedule, upon
becoming final and binding in accordance with the foregoing, shall constitute
the "Final Allocation Schedule." Each of Buyer and Dohmen agrees that neither
it nor any of its respective Affiliates shall file any federal,



state, local and foreign Tax Returns in a manner that is inconsistent with the
Final Allocation Schedule.

(b) If, within thirty (30) days following receipt of the Preliminary
Allocation Schedule by Dohmen (or such longer period as Dohmen and Buyer
mutually agree), Dohmen and Buyer are unable to resolve such disagreement,
then each of Dohmen and Buyer shall, except as set forth on Schedule 1.8, be
entitled to allocate the Purchase Price among the assets of RESTAT in any
manner it so determines in its sole discretion and neither shall have any
obligation or liability to the other with respect to any such allocation.

ARTICLE II 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF DOHMEN

Except only as expressly provided in this Article II or in any certificate
signed by Dohmen delivered by or on behalf of Dohmen pursuant to this
Agreement, none of Dohmen, its Affiliates or any of their respective owners,
directors, managers, officers, employees, agents or representatives makes any
express or implied representation or warranty regarding RESTAT or the Business
of any kind whatsoever, including any representation or warranty as to the
physical condition, use, value of RESTAT's Business or assets or the future
profitability, earnings or cash flow performance of RESTAT. No
representations, warranties or other promises, except any as expressly
provided in this Article II, have been made by Dohmen, its Affiliates or any
of their respective owners, directors, managers, officers, employees, agents
or representatives with respect to the accuracy or completeness of any
information contained in any materials circulated by Dohmen, RESTAT or Leerink
Swann LLC, and, except in the case of fraud or intentional misrepresentation,
none of them shall have any liability to Buyer or its Affiliates arising out
of the use of the information contained in any such materials. ALL IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE
EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED.

Dohmen has delivered to Buyer disclosure schedules (the "Schedules") setting
forth any and all exceptions to the representations and warranties contained
in this Article II. Items of disclosure included in a Schedule for a
particular representation and warranty shall be considered to be made for
purposes of any other representation and warranty of Dohmen contained in this
Agreement to the extent that it would be reasonably apparent to a reasonably
prudent Person on its face (without reference to the text of any document
referred to therein) that such disclosed item would also qualify as an
exception to such other representation and warranty.

Subject to the foregoing, Dohmen represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

2.1 Organization and Qualification.

(f) RESTAT is a limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and
in active status under the laws of the State of Wisconsin. RESTAT has filed
its most recent required annual report with the WDFI, and has not filed
articles of dissolution with the WDFI. RESTAT has the limited liability
company power to own its properties and to carry on the Business as now being
conducted. RESTAT is duly qualified to transact business as a foreign entity
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which, by virtue of the
conduct of the Business or ownership or lease of its assets, it is required to
be so qualified. Schedule 2.1 lists each jurisdiction in which RESTAT is



qualified to transact business as a foreign entity. Neither RESTAT nor Dohmen,
with respect to the Business, has received any written notice, demand or
request from any other jurisdiction that RESTAT is required so to qualify on
account of the ownership or leasing of its assets or properties or the conduct
of the Business. Dohmen has furnished to Buyer true and complete copies of
RESTAT's articles of organization and Amended and Restated Operating Agreement
of RESTAT, dated as of January 1, 2011, by and between Dohmen and RESTAT (the
"Operating Agreement"), each as in effect on the date hereof. RESTAT is not in
default under or in violation of any provisions of its articles of
organization or the Operating Agreement. The Membership Interest certificates
(if any), transfer books and the minute books of RESTAT, all of which have
been made available to Buyer before the date hereof, are true and complete. At
the Closing, all such books will be in the possession of RESTAT.

(g) Dohmen is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in active
status under the laws of the State of Wisconsin. Dohmen has filed its most
recent required annual report with the WDFI, and has not filed articles of
dissolution with the WDFI. Dohmen has the corporate power to own its
properties, including the Membership Interests, and to carry on its business
as now being conducted.

2.2 Subsidiaries. RESTAT does not have nor has it ever had any direct or
indirect ownership, equity or voting interest in any Person or Control of any
Person.

2.3 Capitalization; Title to the Membership Interests.

(d) Dohmen is, and since the date of formation of RESTAT, has been, the sole
record and beneficial owner of all of the Membership Interests, free and clear
of all Encumbrances. The Membership Interests owned by Dohmen represent all of
the equity securities of RESTAT outstanding. Other than such Membership
Interests, Dohmen owns no limited liability company interest in RESTAT and has
no right of any kind to have any such limited liability company interest
issued. Except as represented by the Membership Interests, no Person has any
right to the capital or profits of RESTAT, or rights as to allocations or
distributions thereof, or any voting rights. All of the Membership Interests
are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable (to the
extent such concepts are applicable to the Membership Interests), were not
issued in violation of any purchase option, call option, right of first
refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right, and such
Membership Interests are owned by Dohmen, free and clear of all Encumbrances.
Dohmen has full right, power and authority to transfer and deliver to Buyer
valid title to the Membership Interests, free and clear of all Encumbrances,
and the delivery by Dohmen to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement of the
Membership Interests will transfer and convey good and marketable title
thereto to Buyer, free and clear of all Encumbrances.

(e) Except for this Agreement, there are no options, warrants, calls, rights,
puts or agreements to which RESTAT or Dohmen is a party or by which either
RESTAT or Dohmen is bound obligating RESTAT or Dohmen (with respect to RESTAT)
to issue, deliver, sell, redeem or repurchase or cause to be issued,
delivered, sold, redeemed or repurchased, any limited liability company
interests of RESTAT, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for
limited liability company interests, of RESTAT or obligating RESTAT or Dohmen
(with respect to RESTAT) to grant, extend or enter into any such option,
warrant, call, right, put, agreement or convertible security.



There are no Contracts, voting trusts, proxies or understandings with respect
to the voting, sale, transfer or registration under the Securities Act of any
of the Membership Interests.

that this Agreement is advisable, fair to and in the best interest of Dohmen

Permitted Encumbrances. The furniture, furnishings, machinery, equipment,
vehicles and other tangible personal property owned or leased by RESTAT and
used or held for use in the operation or conduct of the Business are, in the
aggregate, (a) in reasonably good operating condition and repair (normal wear,
tear and obsolescence excepted) and (b) suitable and adequate for the conduct
of the Business as presently conducted. Except for (i) Cash and assets used to
provide services pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement and (ii)

with GAAP applied by RESTAT on a consistent basis throughout the indicated

other Schedule hereto, RESTAT is not subject to any material Liability (which

(c) Title. RESTAT neither owns nor ever has owned any real property, except
that RESTAT owned the Schoolhouse Property until April, 2012, at which time
all right, title and interest in and to the Schoolhouse Property was assigned
to Dohmen. Schedule 2.7(a) sets forth true and correct addresses of all real
property currently leased, licensed, subleased or rented by RESTAT (the
"Leased Real Property"), which are not subject or subordinate to any
Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances. RESTAT has valid interests in
the Leased Real Property. The use and operation of the Leased Real Property by
RESTAT materially conform to all applicable Laws, Permits and Orders. The
Leased Real Property is all of the real property currently used or held for
use in the Business. There are no (i) violations by RESTAT of building,
zoning, safety or fire ordinances or regulations with respect to any Leased
Real Property; (ii) claims by RESTAT of any material defect or deficiency with
respect to any Leased Real Property; or (iii) agreements or other written
documents to which RESTAT is a party for the performance of any repairs,
alterations or other work to the Leased Real Property reasonably expected to
cost RESTAT more than $50,000 in any single instance or $250,000 in the
aggregate of all such instances, other than any which RESTAT has remedied or
corrected, or otherwise governing or materially affecting the occupancy or
tenancy of any of the Leased Real Property by RESTAT. RESTAT is not a party to
or obligated under any Contract to purchase any real property, or, except as
provided in any Lease described in Section 2.7(b) hereof, to lease any Leased
Real Property or other real property.

(d) Leases. Each parcel of the Leased Real Property is the subject of a
written lease, license or sublease agreement identified on Schedule 2.7(b),
true and complete copies of which have been delivered or otherwise made
available to Buyer (individually, a "Lease" and, collectively, the "Leases"),
along with any title opinions, surveys and appraisals in Dohmen's or RESTAT's
possession or any policies of title currently in force and in the possession
of Dohmen or RESTAT with respect to each parcel of Leased Real Property.
Except as identified in Schedule 2.7(b), RESTAT is the tenant, licensee or
subtenant under each written Lease pertaining to each Leased Real Property,
RESTAT has not assigned or transferred any of its right, title or interest in
or to any Leased Real Property or any Lease relating thereto, nor has RESTAT
sublet the right to use or occupy any Leased Real Property or portion thereof.
Each Lease is in full force and effect and RESTAT is not in violation, and the
landlord or licensor has not waived, any of the terms and conditions of any
Lease. All covenants to be performed by RESTAT and, to Dohmen's Knowledge, the
landlord or licensor under each Lease have been performed in all material
respects.

2.8 Intellectual Property.

(a) List. Schedule 2.8(a) sets forth a complete and accurate list of the
following Intellectual Property: (i) patents and patent applications; (ii)
trademark, trade name, and service mark registrations and applications for
registrations thereof and material unregistered trademarks; (iii) registered
copyrights and applications for registrations thereof; and (iv) software
(excluding



Desktop Software) that is material (i.e., in the case of software that RESTAT
licenses involves the expenditure by RESTAT of more than $250,000 on an annual
basis) used in the conduct of the Business as currently conducted or otherwise
owned by or licensed to RESTAT or Dohmen, with respect to the Business.
Schedule 2.8(a) identifies, in each case, whether RESTAT is the owner or
licensee of the Intellectual Property identified thereon, and the expiration
date and registration or application number, if any. "Desktop Software" means
any mass market software licensed to or used by RESTAT that is commercially
available and subject to "shrink-wrap" or "click-through" license agreements.

(b) General.

(i) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.8(b)(i)(1), RESTAT owns the entire
right, title and interest in and to, or has a valid right to use all
Intellectual Property (including that described in Schedule 2.8(a)) necessary
to conduct the Business as currently conducted, and, to Dohmen's Knowledge,
there is no other intellectual property necessary for RESTAT to conduct the
Business as currently conducted. Each item of Intellectual Property purported
to be owned by RESTAT ("Owned IP") is subsisting and has not been held to be
invalid and unenforceable, has not been abandoned or passed into the public
domain and all right, title and interest therein is owned by RESTAT, free and
clear of any Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances). Except as set
forth in Schedule 2.8(b)(i)(2), RESTAT has not, in whole or in part,
transferred ownership of, or granted any exclusive license of or exclusive
right to use, or authorized the retention of any exclusive rights to use or
joint ownership of, any of the Owned IP to any Person.

(ii) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.8(b)(ii): (A) RESTAT has received no
written claims or demands of any Third Party pertaining to RESTAT's ownership
or right to use the Intellectual Property or the validity or enforceability of
any Owned IP, and (B) no Litigation is pending or, to Dohmen's Knowledge, has
been instituted or threatened that challenges the validity, ownership or use
of the Intellectual Property by RESTAT. The operation of the Business as it is
currently conducted does not infringe or misappropriate any intellectual
property rights of any Person, and neither Dohmen nor RESTAT has received any
written notice or, to Dohmen's Knowledge, other communication overtly alleging
or that would reasonably be construed as overtly alleging that RESTAT's use or
possession of any Intellectual Property, or the conduct of the Business as
currently conducted, may infringe on or misappropriate the intellectual
property rights of any Third Party.

(iii) To Dohmen's Knowledge, each of RESTAT and Dohmen, with respect to the
Business, has taken reasonable steps to protect its rights in its Confidential
Information and Trade Secrets. There has been no unauthorized disclosure or
use by Business Employees, consultants, officers, equityholders and agents of,
and, to Dohmen's Knowledge, there has otherwise been no unauthorized
disclosure or use of, Confidential Information, Trade Secrets and other know-
how of the Business, other than any such unauthorized disclosure that,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(iv) No Owned IP constitutes open source, public source or freeware
intellectual property, or is subject to a license that, with respect to the
foregoing, requires RESTAT to distribute or provide access to the public of
the source code of the applicable Owned IP.



(v) To Dohmen's Knowledge, RESTAT has information technology systems that are,
in the aggregate, reasonably adequate to operate the Business as it is
currently conducted. RESTAT has taken reasonable steps to safeguard the
information technology systems utilized in the operation of the Business as it
is currently conducted. To Dohmen's Knowledge, there have been no unauthorized
intrusions or breaches of the security of RESTAT's information technology
systems within the past two (2) years.

(c) IP Contracts. Schedule 2.8(c) lists all material (i.e., as to clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii) hereof, involving the expenditure or receipt, respectively, by
RESTAT exceeding $250,000 per annum) Contracts to which Dohmen, with respect
to the Business, or RESTAT is a party under which such Person (i) is licensed
or otherwise obtains rights to use, modify, sell or license Intellectual
Property (other than Desktop Software), including licenses from Related
Parties, (ii) licenses or otherwise permits other Persons (including Dohmen)
to use, modify, sell or register, in each case, any Intellectual Property,
other than "click-thru" licenses accessed via RESTAT's websites, or (iii)
otherwise relating to RESTAT's ownership or right to use, or the maintenance
of, Intellectual Property (collectively, the "IP Contracts"). To Dohmen's
Knowledge, no actions by any Third Party infringe upon or misappropriate any
Owned IP.

(d) Net Names. Schedule 2.8(d) sets forth a complete and accurate list of all
Net Names registered with a domain name registrar. RESTAT is the owner of or
has a valid right to use the Net Names set forth in Schedule 2.8(d). No such
Net Name is involved in any pending opposition, invalidation or cancellation
proceeding nor, to Dohmen's Knowledge, is any such proceeding threatened.

2.12 Environmental Compliance.

(a) Compliance. RESTAT is and has been in compliance in all material respects
with all Environmental Laws relating to the Leased Real Property or any other
real property previously owned or operated by RESTAT. RESTAT has obtained and
possesses, and has possessed, all Permits which are necessary or required
under Environmental Laws in connection with the operation of the Leased Real
Property and the Business conducted thereat; and RESTAT is and has been in
compliance in all material respects with such Permits. Neither RESTAT nor
Dohmen, with respect to the Business, has received any written notice or other
communication, whether from a Governmental Authority, citizens group, employee
or any other Person, that alleges that RESTAT



or Dohmen, with respect to the Business, has been or is not in compliance with
any Environmental Law.

(b) Claims for Remediation. Since January 1, 2010, neither RESTAT nor Dohmen,
with respect to the Business, has received any Environmental Claim from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person, or other written demand to
undertake or contribute to the costs of investigating, restoring, repairing,
cleaning up or otherwise remediating (i) Leased Real Property or (ii) any
other real property owned or operated by RESTAT or Dohmen, with respect to the

other than any Environmental Claim which has been remedied or obtained case
closure from the appropriate Governmental Authority.

Business, other than any which has been remedied or obtained case closure from
the appropriate Governmental Authority.

2.13 Taxes. Except as set forth in Schedule 2.13:

(a) General. Each of Dohmen and RESTAT has timely filed all income Tax Returns
and all other material Tax Returns required to be filed by it (taking into
account all applicable extensions to file any such Tax Returns). All such Tax
Returns are true and complete and disclose all Taxes required to be paid by or
with respect to Dohmen, to the extent RESTAT is or may become liable therefor,
and RESTAT for the periods covered thereby. All Taxes due and owing by RESTAT
or Dohmen (to the extent RESTAT is or may become liable therefor), whether or
not shown on any Tax Return, have been paid. Neither RESTAT nor Dohmen, to the
extent RESTAT is or may become liable therefor, is currently the beneficiary
of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. Neither RESTAT
nor Dohmen has, since January 1, 2010, received written notice by a
Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction where RESTAT or Dohmen, as the case
may be, has never filed Tax Returns asserting that RESTAT or Dohmen (to the
extent RESTAT is or may become liable therefor) is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction. There are no Tax rulings, requests for rulings,
or closing agreements entered into by RESTAT or Dohmen relating to Taxes that
reasonably could be expected to affect RESTAT's liability for Taxes for any
taxable period ending after the Closing Date.

(b) Withholdings. Each of RESTAT and Dohmen (to the extent RESTAT is or may
become liable therefor) has withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental
Authority all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with
any amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor,
member, or other Third Party.

(c) Audits. No Tax audits or administrative or judicial Tax proceedings are
pending or, to Dohmen's Knowledge, threatened in writing with respect to
RESTAT or Dohmen (to the extent that RESTAT is or may become liable therefor).
Neither RESTAT nor Dohmen has received in writing from any Governmental
Authority any (i) notice indicating an intent to open an



audit or other review with respect to Taxes for which RESTAT is or may become
liable, (ii) request for information related to Taxes for which RESTAT is or
may become liable, or (iii) notice of deficiency or proposed adjustment for
any amount of Tax proposed, asserted, or assessed by such Governmental
Authority with respect to which RESTAT is or may become liable. All
deficiencies asserted or assessments made as a result of any examination of
the Tax Returns referred to in the first sentence of Section 2.13(a) have been
paid in full or otherwise finally resolved. There are no liens for Taxes upon
the assets of RESTAT except liens relating to current Taxes not yet due.

(d) Examined Returns. No material Tax Returns required to be filed by or with
respect to RESTAT or Dohmen (to the extent RESTAT is or may become liable
therefor) for Tax periods beginning after the year ended December 31, 2008
have been examined. None of RESTAT or Dohmen has waived any statute of
limitations in respect of Taxes for which RESTAT is or may become liable or
agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency
with respect to which RESTAT is or may become liable, which waiver or
extension is currently in effect, and no request for such a waiver or
extension is outstanding.

(e) Dohmen's and RESTAT's Tax Status. Dohmen has been a validly electing S
corporation for federal and state (where applicable) income Tax purposes
within the meaning of Code Sections 1361 and 1366 and corresponding provisions
of state Law since January 1, 2007. At all times since its formation, RESTAT
has been properly disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for federal
and state income Tax purposes pursuant to Treasury Regulations §
301.7701-3(b)(ii) and corresponding provisions of state income Tax law. At no
time since its formation has RESTAT (or any direct or indirect predecessor of
RESTAT, other than Dohmen) been treated for any federal or state income Tax
purposes as an association or other entity (or publicly traded partnership)
taxable as a corporation. At all times since its formation, all of the limited
liability company interests of RESTAT have been beneficially owned by Dohmen.
Neither Dohmen nor RESTAT has any liability for Taxes of another Person
pursuant to Treasury Regulations § 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
state, local, or other law), for which RESTAT is or may become liable, as
transferee or successor or otherwise.

(f) Tax Sharing Agreements. RESTAT will not have any Liability under any Tax
Sharing Arrangement or Tax indemnity arrangement on or after the Closing Date.

(g) No Unpaid Taxes. The unpaid Taxes of RESTAT (i) did not, as of the Latest
Balance Sheet Date, exceed the Taxes reflected as a Liability or reserve for
Tax Liabilities (rather than any Liability or reserve for deferred Taxes
established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set
forth on the face of the Latest Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes
thereto), and (ii) will not, as of the close of business on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, exceed the Taxes reflected as a
Liability or reserve for Tax Liabilities (rather than any Liability or reserve
for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and
Tax income) on the Closing Date Balance Sheet.

(h) Reportable Transactions. Neither Dohmen nor RESTAT has entered into any
"reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation §
1.6011-4(b)(2).

(i) FIRPTA. No transaction contemplated by this Agreement is subject to
withholding under Section 1445 of the Code (relating to "FIRPTA").



(j) Powers of Attorney. Any powers of attorney granted by RESTAT (or Dohmen in
respect of RESTAT) prior to the Closing relating to Taxes will terminate and
be of no effect following the Closing.

2.14 Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) General. Schedule 2.14(a) sets forth a complete and accurate list of each
Plan covering or providing benefits to any Business Employee (or the
dependents or beneficiaries of any such Business Employees) (all of the
foregoing being herein called "RESTAT Plans") and Schedule 5.4(e) sets forth a
complete and accurate schedule of the maximum bonus opportunity for each
Business Employee listed on Schedule 5.4(e) under all of RESTAT'S 2013 bonus
programs, other than any bonuses paid by Dohmen to such Business Employees
pursuant to Item 1(ii) of Schedule 4.1. True and complete copies of the
following with respect to each RESTAT Plan have been delivered or otherwise
made available to Buyer: (i) all documents setting forth the terms of each
RESTAT Plan, including any amendments thereto and related trust documents (or,
in the case of any unwritten RESTAT Plan, descriptions thereof); (ii) the
annual reports (Form 5500 series) and accompanying schedules, if any, with
respect to each RESTAT Plan (if any such report was required to be filed with
the IRS) for the last three complete fiscal years; (iii) the most recent
summary plan description together with the summaries of material modifications
thereto, if any, with respect to each RESTAT Plan; (iv) all currently
effective IRS rulings or determination letters relating to any RESTAT Plan;
(v) all written materials provided to any Business Employee relating to any
RESTAT Plan and any proposed RESTAT Plans, in each case, relating to any
amendments, terminations, establishments, increases or decreases in benefits,
acceleration of payments or vesting schedules or other events that would
result in any Liability to RESTAT; (vi) all correspondence since January 1,
2010 to or from any Governmental Authority relating to any RESTAT Plan; and
(viii) all insurance policies pertaining to fiduciary liability insurance
covering the fiduciaries for each RESTAT Plan.

(b) Administration. Each RESTAT Plan (and each related trust, insurance
contract, or fund) has been administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms. All of the RESTAT Plans (and each related trust,
insurance contract, or fund) are and have been in compliance in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other
applicable Laws. All reports, returns and similar documents with respect to
the RESTAT Plans required to be filed with any Governmental Authority or
distributed to any RESTAT Plan participant have been duly filed or
distributed. There are no investigations by any Governmental Authority,
termination proceedings or other claims (except any claim for benefits payable
in the normal operation of the RESTAT Plans) or Litigation pending or, to
Dohmen's Knowledge, threatened, with respect to any RESTAT Plan.

(c) Contributions; Funding. All contributions to, and payments from, the
RESTAT Plans that have been required to be made in accordance with the RESTAT
Plans and applicable Law have been timely made. Each RESTAT Plan that is an
employee welfare benefit plan either (i) is funded through an insurance
company contract and is not a "welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of
Section 419 of the Code, or (ii) is unfunded.

(d) Compliance. All the RESTAT Plans comply, in all material respects, with
the applicable provisions of the Code and ERISA and all applicable regulations
duly promulgated



under either the Code or ERISA. Each RESTAT Plan that is an employee pension
benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA and that is intended
to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code (a "Qualified Plan") is either (i)
an individually designed plan that has received a determination letter from
the IRS to the effect that such Qualified Plan is currently qualified and
exempt from Federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a),
respectively, of the Code, and such determination letter has not been revoked
or (ii) is a prototype plan that has received an approval letter from the IRS
with respect to the prototype plan's qualification under Section 401(a) of the
Code and such approval letter has not been revoked.

(e) Prohibited Transactions; Other Plan Liabilities. No "prohibited
transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA)
has occurred involving the assets of any RESTAT Plan that would reasonably be
expected to subject RESTAT, any Business Employee or a trustee, administrator
or other fiduciary of any trusts created under any RESTAT Plan, to the tax or
penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or the
sanctions and penalties imposed on prohibited transactions under Title I of
ERISA. Neither Dohmen or RESTAT, nor any of the trustees, administrators or
other fiduciaries of any RESTAT Plan, has engaged in any transaction or acted
or failed to act in a manner which would subject Dohmen or RESTAT, or any
RESTAT Plan, to any material tax, penalty or other Liability under ERISA or
any other applicable Law, whether by way of indemnity or otherwise. No RESTAT
Plan or related trust has any material Liability, including Liabilities for
Taxes, other than for routine payments to be made in due course to
participants, investment managers, trustees and beneficiaries.

(f) Certain Matters. Except as provided in Schedule 2.14(f) hereof, the
execution and performance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not constitute an event under any RESTAT Plan that will result in any
payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, vesting,
funding, delivery, or increase in any payments or benefits with respect to any
current or former Business Employee, officer or director of RESTAT. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable to a
Business Employee (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits)
by Dohmen or any of its Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such
transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

(g) Post-Retirement Benefits. No RESTAT Plan provides benefits, including
death, disability, or medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect
to Business Employees beyond their retirement or other termination of service
other than: (i) coverage mandated by applicable Law; (ii) death benefits or
retirement benefits under any "employee pension benefit plan", as that term is
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA; or (iii) benefits, the full cost of which is
borne by the Business Employee (or his or her beneficiary).

(h) COBRA. Each RESTAT Plan which is a "group health plan" within the meaning
of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code (a "Group Health Plan") is and has been
administered in compliance in all material respects with the continuation
coverage requirements initially enacted as part of the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("COBRA") and as formerly provided under
Section 162(k) of the Code and as currently provided under Section 4980B of
the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, and any regulations
promulgated under



either the Code or ERISA with respect to those requirements and with the
privacy regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
at 45 C.F.R. Parts 160 and 164.

(i) Multiemployer Pension Plans. None of the Plans is a "multiemployer plan"
within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer Pension
Plan"). Neither Dohmen nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever contributed to, or
been obligated to contribute to, any Multiemployer Pension Plan on behalf of
any Business Employees. Neither Dohmen nor any ERISA Affiliate has contributed
to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Pension Plan for at
least six (6) years prior to the Closing Date. Neither Dohmen nor any ERISA
Affiliate has or potentially has any Controlled Group Liability to any
Multiemployer Pension Plan, including but not limited to any Liability arising
under Sections 4204(a) or 4212(c) of ERISA.

(j) Defined Benefit Pension Plan; PBGC. None of the Plans is subject to Title
IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, except for the
Retirement Plan for Office Time Clock Employees of Northwestern Drug Company
(the "NDC Retirement Plan") which is not and has never been a RESTAT Plan.
With respect to the NDC Retirement Plan, (i) the applicable minimum funding
standards of Sections 412, 430 and 431 of the Code and Sections 302, 303 and
304 of ERISA, whether or not waived, are satisfied and the NDC Retirement Plan
is not currently, and is not reasonably expected to be, in "at risk status"
within the meaning of Section 430(i) of the Code or Section 303(i) of ERISA;
(ii) neither Dohmen, RESTAT nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has
incurred any outstanding Liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
other than Liabilities for premiums; and (iii) the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation has not instituted proceedings to terminate the NDC Retirement
Plan and no condition exists that presents a risk that such proceedings will
be instituted or that would constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for
the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee or administrator under,
the NDC Retirement Plan. Neither the Buyer nor any Affiliate thereof will
assume or be responsible for any Liabilities arising under or with respect to
the NDC Retirement Plan. There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances
exist that reasonably would be expected to result in, any Controlled Group
Liability that would be a material Liability of Dohmen, RESTAT or any of their
ERISA Affiliates following the Closing for which Dohmen is not obligated to
indemnify pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(vi) hereof. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, neither Dohmen, RESTAT nor any of their ERISA
Affiliates has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069 of ERISA.

2.15 Employee Relationships.

(a) Employment Agreements. Except as set forth in Schedule 2.9(a) or Schedule
2.15(a), no Person is a party to any Contract with RESTAT which provides for
the employment of such Person (other than any Contract terminable "at will")
or which provides for payment by RESTAT of severance, deferred, retention or
incentive (other than routine annual incentive bonus arrangements incurred in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice) compensation
("Employment Agreements").

(b) Change in Control and Stay Bonus Agreements. Except as set forth in
Schedule 2.9(a) or Schedule 2.15(b), no Person is a party to any employment or
other Contract with RESTAT that entitles him or her to compensation or other
consideration (i) as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other change in control of RESTAT, (ii)
as a result of such Person remaining in the employ of RESTAT through the date
of



the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or for a
specified period of time following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other change in control
transactions of RESTAT coupled with the attainment of any RESTAT performance
criteria ("Change in Control/Stay Bonus Agreements"). For the avoidance of
doubt, none of the Contracts listed on Schedule 2.15(a), other than the three
(3) Executive Retention Agreements with Messrs. Helvick, Bergan and Conrad
listed on Schedule 2.15(b), shall be deemed a "Change in Control/Stay Bonus
Agreement."

(c) No Unions. No labor organization has represented or currently represents
any Business Employees for purposes of collective bargaining. Dohmen has no
Knowledge of any Person currently seeking the support of any of the Business
Employees to designate a collective bargaining representative for any group of
Business Employees. There is no current or, to Dohmen's Knowledge, threatened
labor strike, dispute, slow-down or work stoppage against or involving RESTAT.

(d) Compliance with Employment Laws. RESTAT (i) is and has been in compliance
in all material respects with all applicable Laws that relate to employment,
equal employment opportunity (including Laws prohibiting employment
discrimination, harassment or retaliation), wages, hours, leaves, workers'
compensation, disability, occupational safety and health, immigration,
collective bargaining, other employment terms and conditions and plant
closings and layoffs (including the WARN Act and similar state and local
Laws), other than any such noncompliance which, individually or in the
aggregate, does not and will not have an adverse effect on the Business in any
material respect, and (ii) is not liable for any arrears of wages, other
compensation or any Taxes or penalties for failure to comply with any of the
foregoing.

2.16 Events Subsequent to Latest Balance Sheet Date. Except (a) as set forth
in Schedule 2.16, (b) for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
Related Agreements, and (c) for solicitations to and negotiations with other
prospective acquirors of RESTAT, since the Latest Balance Sheet Date, RESTAT
has conducted its business in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice and there has not been:

(i) any Material Adverse Effect on RESTAT or the Business;

(ii) any material damage, destruction, loss or claim to the Membership
Interests or any tangible asset or property of RESTAT, whether or not covered
by insurance; and

(iii) any action taken (or omitted to be taken) by RESTAT which, if such
action were taken following the date hereof, would require the consent of
Buyer or otherwise would violate any of the provisions of Sections 4.1(a)-(z).

2.17 Brokers. Except for Leerink Swann LLC, the fees and expenses of which
will be paid by Dohmen, neither Dohmen nor RESTAT has incurred, or made
commitments for, any brokers', finders' or similar fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



2.18 Insurance. Schedule 2.18 contains a list and brief description
(including name of the policy holder, nature of coverage, limits, deductibles,
premiums and the loss experience for 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 with
respect to each type of coverage) of all policies of insurance maintained with
respect to the Business on the date hereof or otherwise owned or held by or in
the name of RESTAT or Dohmen, with respect to the Business, other than
workers' compensation policies, stop-loss/excess policies or any insurance
policies related to any Plan. Except as set forth in Schedule 2.18, each of
such policies is valid, binding and in full force and effect, and all premiums
due thereunder have been paid. RESTAT or Dohmen, as the case may be, has
complied in all material respects with each such insurance policy, is not in
breach under any such insurance policy and has not failed to give any notice
or present any claim thereunder relating to the Business in a due and timely
manner. Except as set forth in Schedule 2.18, there is no claim pending under
any such insurance policy as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or
disputed by the underwriter of such insurance policy. No written notice of
cancellation or non-renewal or breach of any insurance policy listed on
Schedule 2.18 has been received by RESTAT or Dohmen (with respect to the
Business) since January 1, 2010. All such policies or comparable insurance
policies will be kept in full force and effect through the Closing Date.

2.19 Permits.

(a) General. RESTAT possesses, and has possessed, all Permits from
Governmental Authorities and any other regulatory authorizations from any
Governmental Authorities which are necessary to entitle it to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on the Business as currently
conducted, except as described on Schedule 2.19(a). Schedule 2.19(a) sets
forth a list and brief description (including dates of expiration) of all

received by RESTAT or Dohmen (with respect to the Business) since January 1,
2010. Each of such Permits is valid, subsisting and in full force and effect
(provided, however, that Dohmen makes no representation or warranty concerning
the continued existence of validity of any Permit as a result of the change in
control of RESTAT contemplated by this Agreement).

2.20 Related Parties. Except as set forth in Schedule 2.20, since January 1,
2010, RESTAT has not purchased, leased, licensed or otherwise acquired any

that will remain in place from and after the Closing Date or with respect to
which RESTAT will have any ongoing obligations after the Closing Date. Except

permitted to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the Business. Dohmen
and RESTAT shall only be required to provide such access and furnish such
information to the extent that it would not violate applicable Laws or
Contracts; provided, however, that Dohmen shall, and shall cause RESTAT to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of any Third Party

representations and warranties made by Dohmen in this Agreement; or (b)
determining whether any of the conditions set forth in Article VII have been
satisfied.

4.5 Governmental Approvals; Consents.

(e) General. During the period from the date of this Agreement and until the

pursuant to Section 4.5(a) hereof, as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the date hereof and in no event more than five (5) business days after the
date hereof, Dohmen shall file with the FTC and the Antitrust Division the
notifications and other information and submissions required to be filed under
the HSR Act or other antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions

additional information requested by the FTC or the Antitrust Division under
the HSR Act or other antitrust Laws with respect to the notification filed by

reasonable efforts to obtain early termination or expiration of the applicable

expressly set forth in Schedule 2.20 as remaining in place from and after the
Closing; it being the Parties' mutual intent and expectation that, except as
so provided in Schedule 2.20, all Related Party Agreements, including such
intercompany accounts between RESTAT and Dohmen, will be eliminated such that
none will exist for purposes of preparing the Closing Date Balance Sheet.
Following the Closing Date, neither RESTAT and its Affiliates (including Buyer
and its Affiliates), on the one hand, nor Dohmen and any other Related Party,
on



the other hand, shall have any obligation or Liability to the other with

Laws, RESTAT may pay Cash distributions to Dohmen at any time or times prior
to the Valuation Time so long as the source of such distributions is not from
the proceeds of any Indebtedness from Third Parties incurred by RESTAT.

(c) Confidential Information. Dohmen acknowledges and agrees that all business
relationships and goodwill of RESTAT constitute valuable proprietary rights
and interests of RESTAT, and inure to the sole benefit of, and are the
property of, RESTAT. Dohmen further acknowledges and agrees that upon its
admittance as a member in RESTAT, it contributed to RESTAT all of its right,
title and interest in and to the goodwill, business relationships, and other
intangible assets related to the Business, and that such intangible assets now
constitute valuable proprietary rights and interests of RESTAT, and inure to
the sole benefit of, and are the property of, RESTAT. Dohmen acknowledges and
agrees that it has acquired valuable knowledge of certain confidential
information that constitutes the property of RESTAT solely and exclusively,
and which, if lost or used by Dohmen outside the Business could cause
irreparable and continuing injury to the Business for which there will be no
adequate remedy at Law. Conditioned upon the Closing and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, during the Restricted Period, Dohmen shall,
and shall cause each other Restricted Party to, retain in confidence and shall
not disclose, communicate or divulge to any Person, or use for the benefit of
any Person, any Confidential Information relating to the Business's current
operations. Dohmen further acknowledges and agrees that all Confidential
Information to the extent relating to the operations of RESTAT or the Business
made or received by Dohmen are the exclusive property of RESTAT. Confidential
Information means proprietary information, whether oral, written, recorded
magnetically or electronically or otherwise stored, which is possessed by or
developed for RESTAT, which information is not reasonably ascertainable by
RESTAT's competitors or by the general public through lawful means, including
proprietary data processing systems and software; corporate information,
including contractual arrangements, plans, strategies, tactics, policies,
technologies, inventions, know-how, and any Litigation or negotiations;

hereafter becomes generally available to the public without a breach (directly
or indirectly) by a Restricted Party of this Agreement, (b) disclosure is made
to a Governmental Authority where it is necessary or appropriate to disclose
such information to such Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the
Parties, or (c) disclosure is otherwise required by Law; provided, however
that in the case of clauses (b) and (c), (i) Dohmen shall, and shall cause
each other Restricted Party to, provide RESTAT with prompt notice of such
requirement as well as a copy of the text of the proposed disclosure as far in
advance of its disclosure as is reasonably practicable, and will in good faith
consult with and consider the suggestions of RESTAT concerning the nature and
scope of the information such Restricted Party proposes to disclose, (ii)
Dohmen agrees, and shall cause each other Restricted Party to agree, to
cooperate reasonably with and not to oppose any action by RESTAT to obtain a
protective order or other appropriate remedy in order to limit such
disclosure, in each case at RESTAT's sole expense and (iii) in the event that
no such protective order or other remedy is obtained, or in the event RESTAT
waives compliance with the terms of this sentence, such Restricted Party may
disclose only that part of the Confidential Information as it is advised by
counsel in writing is legally required to be disclosed, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts (at RESTAT's sole expense) to ensure that all
Confidential Information and other information that is so disclosed will be
accorded confidential treatment.

(d) Trade Secrets. Conditioned upon the Closing and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, Dohmen shall, and shall cause each other
Restricted Party to, retain in confidence and not disclose, communicate or
divulge to any Person, or use for the benefit of any Person any Trade Secrets
of RESTAT so long as they remain Trade Secrets. For purposes hereof, the term
"Trade Secrets" has the meaning ascribed thereto in the Wisconsin Uniform
Trade Secrets Act.

(e) Severability. Each of the covenants contained in Section 4.8(a) through
and including 4.8(c) is independent and severable. If any such covenant shall
for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other Sections
or subsections of this Section 4.8, but this Section 4.8 shall be construed as
if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained
herein. It is the intention of the Parties that if any of the restrictions or
covenants contained herein is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a
length of time which is not permitted by applicable Law, or in any way
construed to be unreasonable or to any extent invalid, such provision shall
not be construed to be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent such
provision would be valid or enforceable under applicable Law, a court of
competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or reform this Section 4.8
to provide for a covenant having a reasonable and enforceable geographic area,
time period and other provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as
shall be valid and enforceable under such applicable Law. Accordingly, Buyer
would be irreparably harmed by any breach of this Section 4.8 and there would
be no adequate remedy at Law or in damages to compensate Buyer for any such
breach. Without limiting any other available remedies, Dohmen agrees that
Buyer shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief requiring specific
performance of this Section 4.8 without bond, in addition to such further or
other relief as may appertain at equity or Law. Dohmen shall not assert that
an adequate remedy at Law exists. Obtainment of such an injunction by Buyer
shall not be considered an election of remedies or a waiver of any right by



Buyer to assert any other remedies Buyer has at Law or in equity. No waiver of
any breach or violation hereof shall be implied from the forbearance or
failure by Buyer to take action hereon.

4.9 Certain Transfers. If Dohmen has not done so by the date of this
Agreement, Dohmen may, prior to the Closing, cause RESTAT to transfer the URLs
and domain names (including related content) "dohmen.com," "dohmen.us,"
"dohmencapitalgroup.com," "dohmencapitalgroup.net," "dohmeninvestment.com,"
"dohmeninvestment.net," "benefitallies.com," "benefitallies.org,"
"mybenefitally.com," "mybenefitally.net," and "mybenefitally.org." The Parties
hereto expressly agree to such transfer.

4.10 Benefit Plans after Closing.

(d) Dohmen's Welfare Plans. Effective as of the end of the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, all Business Employees shall cease to be covered
by Dohmen's Welfare Plans (as hereinafter defined). Except as provided in
Section 4.10(b), Dohmen shall be responsible, after the Closing, for all of
the following claims incurred by Business Employees prior to the Closing Date
under Dohmen's Welfare Plans: (i) under any medical, dental or health plans
for any treatment or service actually rendered prior to the Closing Date (but
not rendered on or thereafter) regardless of whether the service or treatment
is part of an ongoing course of treatment that commenced prior to the Closing
Date; (ii) under any life insurance plans with respect to deaths occurring
prior to the Closing Date; and (iii) for any payments or benefits for claims
incurred prior to the Closing Date under any other of the Dohmen's Welfare
Plans, except that the extent to which any such claims are payable shall be
determined by the provisions of the applicable Dohmen's Welfare Plan. Dohmen
shall be responsible for providing all Business Employees whose employment is
terminated prior to the Closing Date and who are covered under a "Group Health
Plan" (within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) maintained by
Dohmen ("Dohmen's Group Health Plan"), and the qualified spouses and
dependents of these Business Employees, with continuation coverage under
Dohmen's Group Health Plan with respect to "qualifying events" occurring prior
to the Closing Date to the extent required by the provisions of COBRA, as
currently set forth in Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section
4980B of the Code, and the implementing regulations promulgated or proposed
under either of those laws. Buyer shall not assume and shall have no
obligation to provide, nor any Liability for, any benefits of any kind under
any of Dohmen's Welfare Plans which shall remain the sole responsibility of
Dohmen on and after the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section, "Dohmen's
Welfare Plans" shall include each RESTAT Plan (as defined in Section 2.14(a)
herein) that is not an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA.

(e) Dohmen's FSA and DCA Plans. Dohmen maintains a flexible spending account
plan (the "Dohmen FSA Plan") under Section 105(h) of the Code and a dependent
care assistance plan (the "Dohmen DCA Plan") under Section 129 of the Code, to
which Business Employees may irrevocably elect to have amounts taken from
their compensation and contributed to accounts under the respective Plans for
a plan year. After the Closing Date, pursuant to a separate agreement to be
executed at the Closing between Dohmen and Buyer, Dohmen shall cause the
Dohmen FSA Plan to transfer to the Buyer's flexible spending account plan
under Section 105(h) of the Code (the "Buyer's FSA Plan") the unexpended
account balance, as of the date of the transfer, of each Business Employee
participating in the Dohmen FSA Plan. Upon completion of such



transfer, the Buyer's FSA Plan shall be solely and exclusively responsible for
providing benefits to Business Employees with respect to the transferred
account balances under the Buyer's FSA Plan. After the Closing Date, pursuant
to a separate agreement to be executed at the Closing between Dohmen and
Buyer, Dohmen shall cause the Dohmen DCA Plan to transfer to the Buyer's
dependent care assistance plan under Section 129 of the Code (the "Buyer's DCA
Plan") the unexpended account balance, as of the date of the transfer, of each
Business Employee participating in the Dohmen DCA Plan. Upon completion of
such transfer, the Buyer's DCA Plan shall be solely and exclusively
responsible for providing benefits to Business Employees with respect to the
transferred account balances under the Buyer's DCA Plan.

(f) Dohmen 401(k) Plan. Dohmen maintains The F. Dohmen Company 401(k) Plan
(the "Dohmen 401(k) Plan"), a defined contribution profit-sharing plan with a
cash or deferred arrangement that is intended to be qualified under Sections
401(a) and 401(k) of the Code. Dohmen shall retain sponsorship of the Dohmen
401(k) Plan after the Closing Date and neither Buyer nor any plan maintained
by Buyer shall be entitled to any assets of the Dohmen 401(k) Plan. Buyer
shall not assume any responsibility or Liability for the Dohmen 401(k) Plan,
and Dohmen and the Dohmen 401(k) Plan shall remain solely and entirely
responsible for satisfying any and all Liabilities arising under the Dohmen
401(k) Plan. Except as provided in Section 5.4(c), the accrued benefits under
the Dohmen 401(k) Plan of all Business Employees shall become 100% vested and
non-forfeitable as of the Closing Date to the extent not already 100% vested
and non-forfeitable and Dohmen shall cause the Dohmen 401(k) Plan to be
amended, if necessary, to provide for such 100% vesting and nonforfeitability.
The accrued benefits of the Business Employees under the Dohmen 401(k) Plan
shall be distributed to these Business Employees after the Closing Date, if
elected by such Business Employees and in accordance with the terms of the
Dohmen 401(k) Plan and the applicable provisions of the Code.

(g) Workers' Compensation. Dohmen shall be liable for any workers'
compensation or similar workers' protection claims of any Business Employee
incurred with respect to which the date of injury occurred prior to the
Closing Date.

(h) Business Employee Transfers. Effective no later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, the Business Employees identified on Schedule
4.10(e) shall be transferred to Dohmen and Dohmen shall be responsible for all
compensation and benefits to be paid to or received by such Business Employees
on and after the date of such transfer of employment. For the avoidance of
doubt, neither Buyer nor RESTAT shall pay such Business Employees any bonuses
with respect to 2013 or any severance or other post-employment compensation.

4.11 Release of Guaranties and Bonds. Dohmen shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer to obtain the Guaranty Releases in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer signed by the obligees.

4.12 Retention of Business Records; Access. Dohmen shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, retain for a period of at least six (6) years following the
Closing Date, all of the records in the possession of Dohmen or its Affiliates
on the Closing Date related to the Business (including Tax records and other
records which could be relevant to determine whether Buyer is or may be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(iii) or the amount of
such indemnification), and upon reasonable prior written request by Buyer,
shall provide Buyer reasonable access to the



same during normal business hours to the extent such access may reasonably be
required by Buyer in connection with matters relating to or affected by the
operations of the Business prior to the Closing Date; provided, that prior to
the expiration of such six (6) year period, Dohmen or its Affiliates may
dispose of any of such records which it no longer desires to retain if Dohmen
or its Affiliates first shall have notified Buyer in writing of such proposed
disposition and allowed Buyer a reasonable opportunity to take possession of
the records proposed to be disposed of.

4.13 Use of Name. As promptly as practicable following the Closing, (a) Dohmen
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, amend or terminate any certificate
of assumed name or d/b/a filings so as to eliminate its right to use the name
"RESTAT", or any name that, in the reasonable judgment of Buyer, is similar to
such name, and (b) Dohmen shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
thereafter use such name or other names acquired by Buyer hereunder or names
confusingly similar thereto.

4.14 No Solicitation of Purchase Proposals. Effective upon the execution
hereof, Dohmen shall, and shall cause RESTAT to, terminate any discussions or
negotiations regarding any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Other Bid, and shall promptly after the execution
hereof request each Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with its consideration of acquiring RESTAT or substantially all the
Business or assets of RESTAT to return or destroy all confidential information
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of Dohmen or RESTAT. From the date
hereof until October 1, 2013, Dohmen shall not directly, nor shall Dohmen
indirectly through any of its or RESTAT's respective directors, officers,
partners, members, stockholders, Affiliates, employees, agents, consultants,
advisors or other representatives (each, a "Representative"), including legal
counsel, accountants and financial advisors, authorize or permit any such
Representative to, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage any Other Bid, (ii)
enter into any Contract with respect to any Other Bid or (iii) participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Other Bid; provided, however, that after October 1,
2013 until the Closing, Dohmen and its Representatives may take the foregoing
actions except that neither Dohmen nor any of its Representatives shall (A)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person any information with respect to, any Other Bid unless and until such
other Person has entered into a confidentiality agreement with Dohmen
regarding RESTAT and the Business (x) on terms and conditions no less
restrictive in the aggregate than those terms and conditions applicable to
Buyer set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement and (y) which expressly
provides that RESTAT is a third party beneficiary of all rights of Dohmen
thereunder or (B) enter into any Contract with respect to any Other Bid (other
than a confidentiality agreement), unless and until this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its terms. Dohmen shall, and shall cause RESTAT
to, promptly advise Buyer orally and in writing of any Other Bid or any
inquiry with respect to, or which could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Other Bid and the identity of the Person making any such Other Bid or inquiry.

4.15 Phone Numbers. Dohmen shall transfer each telephone and telephone number
in use by RESTAT or any Business Employee (other than the employees listed on
Schedule 4.8) prior to the Closing to Buyer, effective as of the Closing Date.



4.16 Insurance. After the Closing, at the request of Buyer, Dohmen shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to procure all proceeds of insurance payable
in respect of any claim that arises out of any occurrence pertaining to RESTAT
or the Business prior to Closing for which Dohmen or RESTAT is insured under
Dohmen's general commercial liability insurance covering RESTAT. Any insurance
recovery in respect of any such claim received by Dohmen or any of its
Affiliates shall be remitted promptly following receipt to Buyer (after
deducting any expenses incurred by Dohmen in procuring such recovery).

ARTICLE V 
COVENANTS OF BUYER

Buyer covenants and agree with Dohmen as follows:

5.1 Conditions to Closing. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things in
each case, within Buyer's control, necessary or advisable to cause the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2 to be satisfied and to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the satisfaction thereof. Subject to the satisfaction of all other conditions
at the Closing, Buyer shall execute and deliver all agreements and documents
relating to Buyer and required to be executed or delivered by Buyer as set

5.2 Governmental Approvals; Consents.

(c) General. During the period from the date of this Agreement and until the
Closing Date, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate
with Dohmen in attempting to obtain any consents and approvals of Governmental
Authorities or Third Parties required to be obtained by Buyer in order to
permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
to otherwise satisfy the conditions in Sections 7.1(d), 7.1(e) or 7.2(d).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dohmen shall, and shall cause RESTAT to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer, but Buyer shall be
primarily responsible for filing all notifications with or obtaining necessary
approvals or authorizations from Governmental Authorities with respect to
Permits which RESTAT (after the Closing) may require in order to conduct the
Business without interruption notwithstanding the change in control of RESTAT
contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) HSR. In addition to and without limiting the obligations of Buyer pursuant
to Section 5.2(a) hereof, as promptly as reasonable practicable after the date
hereof and in no event more than five (5) business days after the date hereof,
Buyer shall file with the FTC and the Antitrust Division the notifications and
other information and submissions required to be filed under the HSR Act or
other antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.
Buyer agrees to make available to Dohmen such information as Dohmen may
reasonably request relative to the business, assets and property of Buyer and
its Affiliates as may be required by Dohmen to file any additional information
requested by the FTC or the Antitrust Division under the HSR Act or other
antitrust Laws with respect to the notification filed by Dohmen in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to supply any additional information requested by the FTC,
Antitrust Division or other Governmental Authority, under the



HSR Act or other antitrust Laws; promptly provide to Dohmen copies of all
material correspondence between it (or its advisors) and any such agency
relating to this Agreement or any of the matters described in this Section
5.2(b); subject to applicable Laws, permit Dohmen to review in advance any

of Dohmen.

5.3 Retention of Business Records; Access. Buyer shall, or shall cause RESTAT
to, retain for a period of at least six (6) years following the Closing Date,
all of the records in the possession of RESTAT on the Closing Date (including
Tax records and other records which could be relevant to determine whether
Buyer is or may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(iii)
or the amount of such indemnification), and upon reasonable prior written
request by Dohmen, shall provide Dohmen reasonable access to the same during
normal business hours to the extent such access may reasonably be required by
Dohmen in connection with matters relating to or affected by the operations of
the Business prior to the Closing Date; provided, that prior to the expiration
of such six (6) year period, Buyer or RESTAT may dispose of any of such
records which it no longer desires to retain if Buyer or RESTAT first shall
have notified Dohmen in writing of such proposed disposition and allowed
Dohmen a reasonable opportunity to take possession of the records proposed to
be disposed of.

5.4 Buyer's Benefits Plans.

(g) Buyer's 401(k) Plan. Buyer has established and maintains a defined
contribution profit-sharing plan with a cash or deferred arrangement that is
intended to be qualified under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code (the
"Buyer's 401(k) Plan"). The Buyer's 401(k) Plan shall provide credit to
Business Employees for all of their service with RESTAT, solely for purposes
of eligibility to participate and vesting, to the same extent such service
would have been credited if the service had been performed for Buyer prior to
the Closing. After the Closing Date, Buyer shall permit Business Employees who
are entitled and who elect to receive an "eligible rollover distribution" (as
described in Section 402(f)(2)(A) of the Code) from the Dohmen 401(k) Plan to
direct that the eligible rollover distribution be transferred to the Buyer's
401(k) Plan in accordance with Section 402(c) of the Code, and the
administrative procedures established under Buyer's 401(k) Plan for the
transfer of "eligible rollover distributions," unless the administrator of
Buyer's 401(k) Plan reasonably concludes that such transfers are not valid
"eligible rollover distributions" under Code Section 401(a)(31) and the
regulations thereunder. Transfers of eligible rollover distributions shall not
include any outstanding loan of a Business Employee under the Dohmen 401(k)
Plan.

(h) Buyer's Welfare Plans. Buyer shall not assume or continue any Plans. Other
than the Buyer's 401(k) Plan described in subsection (a) above, Buyer shall
provide Business Employees, following the Closing Date, with such employee
benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements (the "Buyer's Welfare
Plans") as Buyer may determine, except that with respect to medical and other
health-related benefits, Buyer shall provide each Business Employee (and each



such Business Employee's spouses and dependents) with coverage as of the
Closing Date, under a "group health plan" (within the meaning of Section
5001(b) of the Code) maintained by Buyer (the "Buyer's Group Health Plan")
that provides benefits and includes terms and conditions as determined by
Buyer, except that Buyer shall waive any pre-existing condition exclusions or
restrictions with respect to Business Employees under the Buyer's Group Health
Plan. Each Business Employee shall receive credit under the Buyer's Group
Health Plan for all amounts paid by each Business Employee in calendar year
2013 under the Dohmen's Group Health Plan for purposes of any applicable
deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums. Buyer shall be solely
responsible for providing Business Employees with any continuation coverage
(and shall have sole Liability in respect of any failure to provide such
continuation coverage) under Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Subtitle B
of Title I of ERISA resulting from any "qualifying event" occurring on or
after the Closing Date. Buyer shall grant full credit to Business Employees,
under the Buyer's Welfare Plans that are not group health plans, for service
with Dohmen and RESTAT for purposes of (i) satisfying any and all eligibility
and participation requirements under the Buyer's Welfare Plans and (ii)
determining the amount and duration of any benefits under the Buyer's Welfare
Plans to the extent that service or seniority is a consideration in
calculating benefits but Buyer shall not be required to credit any service
that would result in a duplication of benefits.

(i) Employment Terms and Benefits after the Closing Date. Nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed to limit or restrict Buyer in any way with
respect to (i) the conduct of the Business after the Closing Date; (ii) the
modification or change in the terms of employment (including the termination
of employment) of any Business Employee; and (iii) the modification, amendment
or termination of any employee benefit plan maintained or contributed to by
Buyer, including but not limited to any of the Buyer's Welfare Plans.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 5.4, the provisions of
this Section and Section 4.10 shall not apply to any Business Employee who is
employed by Dohmen and not RESTAT on and after the Closing Date. No Business
Employee, including any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any other person
not a party to this Agreement, shall be entitled to assert any claim, or
otherwise have any third party beneficiary rights, hereunder. Buyer shall be
responsible for all obligations, if any, that may arise under the WARN Act,
including any financial Liability thereunder with respect to any Business
Employees, solely in connection with the terminations of employment of
Business Employees on and after the Closing. Dohmen shall be responsible for
all obligations, if any, that may arise under the WARN Act, including any
financial Liability thereunder, solely in connection with the terminations of
employment of Business Employees prior to the Closing.

(j) Workers' Compensation. Buyer shall be liable for any workers' compensation
or similar workers' protection claims of any Business Employee incurred with
respect to which the date of injury occurred on or after the Closing Date.

(k) Performance Management Bonuses. To the extent that any employee of RESTAT
listed on Schedule 5.4(e) who remains in the employment of RESTAT on the
Closing Date does not receive a performance management bonus at least equal to
the Applicable Bonus Amount on or prior to March 15, 2014, Buyer shall
promptly notify Dohmen and pay, or cause RESTAT to pay, to Dohmen, on or
before March 31, 2014, the Applicable Bonus Amount not so paid to such
employee by March 15, 2014. For purposes hereof, the "Applicable Bonus Amount"
is the amount of the performance management bonus set forth on Schedule 5.4(e)
opposite each



employee's respective name, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of days in 2013 from January 1, 2013 through the Valuation Time
and the denominator of which is 365, provided that such amount is specifically
reflected in and taken into account as a current liability in determining the
Closing Date Working Capital pursuant to Section 1.3.

5.5 Release of Guaranties and Bonds. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts which shall include, but not be limited to, offering to substitute
Buyer's obligations for those of Dohmen) to (a) cause Dohmen and its
Affiliates (other than RESTAT) to be released from all Liabilities arising or
resulting from Dohmen's guaranty of the Lease described I Schedule 2.7(b),
item (1) and each guaranty or indemnification obligation with respect to each
performance, completion or other surety bond or similar undertaking listed on
Schedule 2.9(a) (collectively, the "Guaranty Releases"), and (b) obtain and
deliver to Dohmen at Closing written evidence of such Guaranty Releases (in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Dohmen) signed by the obligees.
If Buyer fails or is unable to obtain and deliver any such Guaranty Releases
to Dohmen at Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold Dohmen and its
Affiliates harmless from and against any Losses and Expenses which Dohmen or
its Affiliates may incur or suffer as a result of such failure or inability.

5.6 No Libel or Slander. For a period of five (5) years following the Closing
Date, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall libel or slander Dohmen or
any of its Affiliates or their respective businesses in any manner that could
reasonably be expected to be harmful to Dohmen, its Affiliates and their
respective businesses.

ARTICLE VI 
TAX MATTERS

6.1 Tax Treatment of Transaction; Straddle Periods.

(e) Intended Tax Treatment of Transaction. Buyer and Dohmen are entering into
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the assumption that: (a) at
all times since its formation, RESTAT has been properly disregarded as an
entity separate from its owner for federal, and all relevant (except as
disclosed in item 1(b) of Schedule 2.13) state, local and other income Tax
purposes pursuant to Treasury Regulations § 301.7701-3 and applicable state,
local and other income Tax law, and (b) for federal, and all relevant state,
local and other income Tax purposes, the sale and purchase of the Membership
Interests pursuant to this Agreement will be properly treated as a sale and
purchase of the assets of RESTAT to which Section 1060 of the Code and
Treasury Regulations thereunder, and comparable provisions of state, local and
other income Tax law, apply (the "Intended Tax Treatment").

(f) Straddle Periods. If it is necessary to determine Liability for Taxes for
purposes of Section 8.2 or refunds of Taxes with respect to a taxable year or
period beginning on or before and ending after the Closing Date (a "Straddle
Period"), the determination of such Taxes or refunds for the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date shall be determined
by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or
periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other which
began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and items of
income, gain, deduction, loss or credit for the Straddle Period shall be
allocated between such two taxable years or periods on the basis of an interim
closing



of the books, except that Taxes, such as real property Taxes, imposed on
periodic basis shall be apportioned on a daily basis and exemptions,
allowances and deductions that are otherwise calculated on an annual basis
shall be apportioned on a daily basis.

6.2 Preparation and Filing of Certain Tax Returns.

(d) Preparation. In accordance with the Intended Tax Treatment, for federal,
state, local and other income Tax purposes Dohmen shall take into account, and
report on its Tax Returns, each item of income, gain, loss and deduction of
RESTAT for all periods through the close of the Closing Date, shall file or
cause to be filed any related Tax Returns required to be filed by or with
respect to RESTAT, and shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes required
to be paid with respect to any such Tax Returns. Dohmen, at its expense, shall
timely file when due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained)
all other Tax Returns which are required to be filed by RESTAT on or prior to
the Closing Date and shall remit, or cause to be remitted, any Taxes required
to be paid with respect to such Tax Returns. Buyer, at its expense, shall
timely file when due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained)
all other Tax Returns that are required to be filed by RESTAT. With respect to
all Tax Returns to be filed by Buyer pursuant to the preceding sentence that
relate to taxable years or periods that end on or before or include the
Closing Date (each, a "Review-Eligible Return"), such Review-Eligible Returns
shall be submitted to Dohmen for review and comment by Dohmen, and Buyer shall
incorporate any changes to such Review-Eligible Returns reasonably requested
by Dohmen. Buyer shall provide Dohmen a draft of any Review-Eligible Return
(along with copies of appropriate workpapers and schedules requested by
Dohmen) at least fifteen (15) days prior to the filing of such Review-Eligible
Return. Buyer shall provide Dohmen timely and reasonable access to RESTAT's
employees, facilities, accountants, books and records in connection with such
Review-Eligible Return.

(e) Amendments. None of Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall file any amended
income Tax Returns, or make any election, with respect to RESTAT for any
taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date without the
written consent of Dohmen, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

(f) Refunds. If RESTAT or Buyer (on behalf of RESTAT) receive, after the
Closing Date, any Tax refunds attributable to any taxable period of RESTAT
ending on or before the Closing Date (including the period ending on the close
of the Closing Date of any Straddle Period), they shall promptly notify Dohmen
thereof and pay over to Dohmen the amount received and attributable to such
tax periods to the extent that such amount (or portion thereof) exceeds the
amount of Tax Refunds reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet and taken
into account in determining the Adjustment Calculation. Buyer shall be
entitled to any refund or credit (i) reflected on the Closing Date Balance
Sheet and taken into account in determining the Adjustment Calculation or (ii)
attributable to any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date (including
the period beginning on the beginning of the day following the Closing Date of
any Straddle Period). Dohmen shall promptly notify Buyer and pay over to Buyer
the amount of any such Tax refund or credit received or taken into account by
Dohmen or any of its Affiliates. Dohmen shall take reasonable steps as may be
requested by Buyer to obtain any refund or credit to which Buyer is entitled
under this Section 6.2(c).



6.3 Contest Provisions. Following the Closing, Buyer shall promptly notify
Dohmen in writing upon receipt by Buyer or RESTAT of notice of any pending or
threatened federal, state, local, foreign or other Tax audits, examinations or
assessments of RESTAT (a "Tax Audit") for any taxable year or period that ends
on or before the Closing Date. Such notice shall describe the asserted Tax
Audit in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notices and other
documents received from any Governmental Authority in respect of such Tax
Audit. Dohmen shall be entitled to control the legal defense (with counsel of
its choosing) of any such Tax Audit provided, however, that Dohmen agrees with
Buyer that, as between Buyer and Dohmen, Dohmen shall be liable for and
indemnify each Buyer Group Member for any and all Losses and Expenses relating
to Taxes that result from such Tax Audit. To the extent that Dohmen controls
any Tax Audit in accordance with this Section 6.3, (i) Dohmen shall provide
Buyer with a timely and reasonably detailed account of each phase of such Tax
Audit, (ii) Dohmen shall reasonably consult with Buyer before taking any
significant action in connection with such Tax Audit, (iii) Dohmen shall
reasonably consult with Buyer and offer Buyer an opportunity to make
reasonable comments before submitting any written materials prepared or
furnished in connection with such Tax Audit, (iv) Dohmen shall defend such Tax
Audit diligently and in good faith as if it were the only party in interest in
connection with such Tax Audit, (v) Buyer shall be entitled to participate, at
its own expense, in such Tax Audit and receive copies of any written materials
relating to such Tax Audit received from the relevant Governmental Authority
and (vi) Dohmen shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Audit, if
such action would reasonably be expected to have an adverse impact on Buyer or
RESTAT, without obtaining the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent
shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed. Buyer shall have
the right to control (or to assume control, in the event that the requirement
set forth in clause (iv) of the preceding sentence ceases to be satisfied), at
its own expense, any other Tax Audit. Nothing herein shall be construed to
impose on Buyer any obligation to defend RESTAT in any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding. Any proceeding with respect to which
Dohmen does not control in accordance with this Section 6.3 may be settled or
compromised in the discretion of Buyer, and any such settlement or compromise
shall not affect any Buyer Group Member's right to indemnification under this
Agreement.

6.4 Cooperation. From and after the Closing Date, each of Dohmen and Buyer
shall: (i) assist in all reasonable respects (and cause their respective
Affiliates to assist) the other party in the preparation of any Tax Returns
that are required to be filed by RESTAT after the Closing Date; (ii) cooperate
in all reasonable respects in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with
Governmental Authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of Dohmen or RESTAT; (iii)
make available to the other and to any Governmental Authority as reasonably
requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of Dohmen
or RESTAT (iv) timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be
necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce),
or file Tax Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes described in
Section 6.6 (relating to sales, transfer and similar Taxes); and (v) furnish
the other with copies of all correspondence received from any taxing authority
in connection with any Tax Audit or information request with respect to any
taxable period that ends on or before or includes the Closing Date.

6.5 Tax Sharing Arrangements. On the Closing Date, all Tax Sharing
Arrangements between either RESTAT, on the one hand, and Dohmen or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, shall be terminated effective as of the closing
of business on the Closing Date and have no further effect for any taxable
year or period (whether a past, present, or future year or period) and no

harmless the Buyer Group Members from any Losses or Expenses indemnifiable

harmless hereunder with respect to, the matters set forth in clauses (i) and
(viii) of this Section 8.2(a) with respect to Losses and Expenses incurred by
the Buyer Group Members (other than Losses and Expenses incurred in connection
with (x) intentional misrepresentation or fraud by Dohmen, or (y) a breach or
inaccuracy of any of the Fundamental Representations or the representations
and warranties of Dohmen contained in Section 2.13 (Taxes) or Section 2.14
(Employee Benefit Plans)):

(A) unless and until the aggregate amount of such Losses and Expenses subject

breach or inaccuracy of any of the Fundamental Representations or the
representations and warranties of Dohmen contained in Section 2.13 (Taxes) or
Section 2.14 (Employee Benefit Plans) or (z) which are disallowed as a result
of clause (B), below) three million dollars ($3,000,000) (the "Threshold") and

Group Members shall be entitled to indemnification only for the aggregate
amount of all such Losses and Expenses in excess of one million five hundred
thousand dollars ($1,500,000); or

(B) with respect to any individual item of Loss or Expense (or group of
similar Losses or Expenses arising out of the same or series of related acts,
conditions or occurrences) involving $50,000 or less and when such Losses and
Expenses exceed $50,000, then the Buyer Group Members shall be entitled to



indemnification for the full amount of such individual item (or group of
similar items as set forth above), subject to clause (A), above, and all other
limitations contained in this Article VIII.

(f) Escrow Agreement. Any payment pursuant to this Section 8.2 made in the
form of a transfer from the Escrowed Funds to any Buyer Group Member shall be
made in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(g) Mitigation. The Buyer Group Members shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the character and amount of all
Losses and Expenses to the extent required by applicable Law upon and after
becoming aware of any event that would reasonably be expected to give rise to
Losses and Expenses that may be indemnifiable under this Section 8.2 (it being
understood and agreed that any reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs or
expenses incurred in connection with such mitigation shall themselves
constitute Losses, to the extent the Losses and Expenses mitigated would have
been indemnifiable pursuant to this Section 8.2).

(h) Materiality. For purposes of this Section 8.2, all representations and
warranties of Dohmen under this Agreement, other than those contained in
Section 2.6(b), shall be construed without giving effect to any materiality,

Buyer as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date (as if made on the
Closing Date) (except with respect to such representations and warranties that
are made as of a specific date other than the date hereof, in which case as of
such date) contained in this Agreement or any certificate signed by Buyer and
delivered by or on behalf of Buyer pursuant hereto; or

(ii) any breach by Buyer of, or the failure by Buyer to perform and comply
with, any of its covenants or agreements, or any failure of Buyer to perform
any of its obligations, contained in this Agreement (including Buyer's failure
to obtain and deliver to Dohmen at Closing any of the Guaranty Releases as
provided in Section 5.5).

(d) Mitigation. The Seller Group Members shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the character and amount of all
Losses and Expenses to the extent required by applicable Law upon and after
becoming aware of any event that would reasonably be expected to give rise to
Losses and Expenses that may be indemnifiable under this Section 8.3 (it being
understood and agreed that any reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs or
expenses incurred in connection with such mitigation shall themselves
constitute Losses, to the extent the Losses and Expenses mitigated would have
been indemnifiable pursuant to this Section 8.3).



(e) Materiality. For purposes of this Section 8.3, all representations and
warranties of Buyer under this Agreement shall be construed without giving
effect to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications
limiting the scope of such representation or warranty.

8.4 Survival of Representations and Indemnity Obligations.

(f) Representations.

(i) (A) Each of the representations and warranties made by Dohmen contained in
Section 2.3 (Capitalization; Title to Membership Interests) and Section 2.4(a)

all other representations and warranties made by Dohmen contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby for a period of eighteen (18) months from the Closing

(ii) (A) Each of the representations and warranties of Buyer contained in
Section 3.2(a) shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby indefinitely and without limitation; (B) each
of the representations and warranties of Buyer contained in Sections 3.1, 3.3
and 3.4 shall survive the Closing and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby until sixty (60) days following expiration of all
applicable statutes of limitations; and (C) all other representations and
warranties made by Buyer contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby for a period of
eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in Section

may be first made by a Party after the expiration of the applicable survival
period set forth in clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 8.4(a); provided, no
claim first made in accordance with the terms of this Article VIII prior to
the expiration of the applicable survival period shall be barred or
extinguished because of the expiration of such applicable survival period.

(g) Release of Escrowed Funds. Subject to the Escrow Agreement and the
following requirements, the Escrowed Funds then held by the Escrow Agent shall
be released by the Escrow Agent within five (5) business days after, and the
indemnification provided for in Section 8.2(a)(i) and Section 8.2(a)(viii)
shall terminate on, the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date
and no claim shall be made by Buyer under Section 8.2(a)(i) or Section
8.2(a)(viii)



thereafter (subject to Dohmen's obligation to indemnify pursuant to Section
8.2(a)(i) with respect to any breach of or inaccuracy in any of the
Fundamental Representations or the representations and warranties contained in
Section 2.13 (Taxes) or Section 2.14 (Employee Benefit Plans) or in the event
of any intentional misrepresentation or fraud, which shall survive until
expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in Section 8.4(a));
provided, that the escrow shall not terminate with respect to any amount that
is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied, bona fide indemnification claim as to
any Losses or Expenses in connection with which a Notice of Claim was timely
given in accordance with the requirements of this Section 8.4 and Section 8.5
on or prior to the date such indemnification obligation would otherwise
terminate in accordance with this Section 8.4, as to which the indemnification
obligation hereunder shall continue until the Liability to be satisfied shall
have been determined pursuant to this Article VIII, and Buyer shall have been
reimbursed for such Losses or Expenses in accordance with the terms hereof.

8.5 Procedures for Making Claims.

(f) Notice of Claim. If and when any Buyer Group Member, on the one hand, or
any Seller Group Member, on the other hand (each, an "Indemnified Party"),
desires to assert a claim for indemnification against a Party obligated to
provide such indemnification in accordance with this Agreement (each, an
"Indemnifying Party"), such Indemnified Party shall deliver a Notice of Claim
to the Indemnifying Party (and, if any Buyer Group Member is the Indemnified
Party, shall simultaneously deliver a Notice of Claim to the Escrow Agent)
reasonably promptly (but not later than twenty (20) days) after such
Indemnified Party's receipt of notice of the assertion or commencement of any
actual or potential claim, action or proceeding; provided, however, that
failure to so timely give a Notice of Claim shall not limit such Indemnified
Party's ability to be indemnified pursuant to this Article VIII unless the
ability of the Indemnifying Party to defend such claim is materially and
actually prejudiced by such failure. If such claim is based upon or related to
any claim, action or proceeding commenced or threatened by a Third Party
against such Indemnified Party (a "Third-Party Claim"), upon the written
request of the Indemnifying Party, such Indemnified Party shall promptly
furnish to the Indemnifying Party copies of any documents in the possession of
such Indemnified Party which reasonably relate to such Third-Party Claim
(including any which are received from such Third Party specifically regarding
such Third-Party Claim).

(g) Notice of Objection. Through the thirtieth (30th) day following delivery
of a Notice of Claim by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party may
deliver a Notice of Objection to the Indemnified Party (and, if any Buyer
Group Member is the Indemnified Party, shall simultaneously deliver a Notice
of Objection to the Escrow Agent). If the Indemnifying Party is Dohmen or its
Affiliates, Buyer agrees that, with respect to any Notice of Claim, it shall,
upon reasonable prior written request by Dohmen, provide Dohmen with
reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the books and records,
employees and agents of RESTAT and the Business to the extent reasonably
related to Dohmen's evaluation of the Notice of Claim and determination of
whether the delivery of a Notice of Objection related to such Notice of Claim
is warranted. If a Notice of Objection shall not have been so delivered within
such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have waived any
objection to the entirety of the claims set forth in the Notice of Claim, and
the Losses and Expenses set forth in the Notice of Claim shall be paid by the
Escrow Agent to Buyer from the Escrowed Funds.



(h) Payment from Escrow. If Dohmen shall make a timely Notice of Objection
containing an admission of any portion of the Losses or Expenses related to
any claim asserted in the Notice of Claim, the Escrow Agent shall pay to Buyer
from the available Escrowed Funds such portion of the Losses and Expenses
identified as expressly admitted in such Notice of Claim in the amount so
admitted. If a Notice of Objection by Dohmen is received by the Escrow Agent,
except for Losses and Expenses so expressly admitted by Dohmen in a Notice of
Objection, the Escrow Agent shall make no payments from the Escrowed Funds to
any Buyer Group Member unless and until such Buyer Group Member's entitlement
to indemnification, as well as the amount of indemnification to which such
Buyer Group Member shall be entitled, under this Article VIII, shall have been
determined by either: (i) the written agreement of Buyer (on behalf of itself
and the Buyer Group Members) and Dohmen (on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates); or (ii) a final and nonappealed judgment or decree of any court
of competent jurisdiction. After any such determination in favor of such Buyer
Group Member of both the entitlement to and the amount of indemnification,
Buyer and Dohmen shall promptly provide joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent regarding the disbursement of available Escrowed Funds to satisfy
the amount of indemnification to which such Buyer Group Member's entitlement
has been so established.

8.6 Defense of Third-Party Claims.

(i) By Indemnifying Party. Except with respect to Third-Party Claims with
respect to Taxes which shall be governed solely by Article VI, in the event an
Indemnified Party determines to make an indemnity claim hereunder with respect
to a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall provide a Notice of Claim
to the Indemnifying Party (and, if any Buyer Group Member is the Indemnified
Party, to the Escrow Agent) in accordance with Section 8.5. The Indemnifying
Party shall, subject to Section 8.6(b), have the right, at its expense, to
conduct and control the defense of any such Third-Party Claim. Notice of the
intention so to conduct and control the defense of such a Third-Party Claim
shall be given by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party within
thirty (30) days after the Indemnifying Party receives the Notice of Claim,
and such notice shall include an acknowledgement without qualification by the
Indemnifying Party that such Third-Party Claim involves Losses and Expenses
which, if successfully asserted against the Indemnified Party, are
indemnifiable by the Indemnifying Party hereunder (subject only to the
applicable limitations set forth in this Article VIII). With respect to any
Third-Party Claim where the Indemnifying Party is entitled to conduct and
control the defense, the Indemnifying Party shall select counsel to defend
such Third-Party Claim and shall defend in good faith such Third Party Claim.
In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-
Party Claim, subject to Section 8.6(b), it shall have the right to take such
reasonable action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or
make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third-Party Claim in the name and on
behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party may participate,
through counsel chosen by it and at its own expense (which expense shall not
constitute a Loss or Expense), in the defense of any such Third-Party Claim as
to which the Indemnifying Party is entitled to and has so elected to conduct
and control the defense thereof and in such event shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party in connection with such defense.

(j) By Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Section 8.6, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume
control of a Third-Party Claim if (A) the Third-Party Claim relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal proceeding,



action, indictment, investigation or allegation, (B) the Third-Party Claim
seeks injunctive or other equitable relief or relief other than for monetary
Losses against the Indemnified Party, (C) the Indemnified Party waives all
rights to recover Losses and Expenses from the Indemnifying Party (including
rights to indemnification) with respect to such Third Party Claim and releases
the Indemnifying Party therefrom in form and substance reasonably required by
such Indemnifying Party, (D) an actual or readily apparent conflict of
interest (as reasonably determined by the Indemnified Party after obtaining
advice of counsel) exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party with respect to the Third-Party Claim that materially precludes
effective joint representation, or (E) with respect to any Third-Party Claim
as to which the Buyer Group Members' sole recourse is to the Escrowed Funds as
provided in Section 8.7(b), the amounts reasonably expected to be incurred in
connection with such Third-Party Claim, together with all other outstanding
claims on the Escrowed Funds, exceed the amount remaining in the Escrowed
Funds by an amount greater than the amounts remaining in the Escrowed Funds.
If, pursuant to this Section 8.6(b), the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to
assume control of the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party
shall do so or shall waive the provisions of this Section 8.6(b) preventing
the Indemnifying Party from assuming control of the defense of such Third-
Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party assumes or is required to assume control
of the defense of such Third-Party Claim for which it is entitled to
indemnification hereunder, it shall conduct such defense in good faith, and
the Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party for the
reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses of defending the Third-Party
Claim which are incurred from time to time, promptly following the
presentation to the Indemnifying Party of itemized bills for such attorneys'
fees and other expenses, subject, however, to any applicable limitations set
forth in this Article VIII. Subject to any applicable limitations set forth in
this Article VIII, all Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by the
Indemnifying Party in connection with the foregoing shall be paid by the
Indemnifying Party. In the event of any Third-Party Claim as to which the
Indemnifying Party voluntarily declines to exercise its right under Section
8.6(a) to assume control of the defense of a Third-Party Claim or fails to
give timely and sufficient notification to the Indemnified Party in writing of
its election to assume control of the defense, the Indemnified Party may,
without prejudice to its right to indemnification hereunder, conduct and
control the defense of such Third-Party Claim as to which indemnification will
be sought hereunder and seek indemnification for any and all Losses and
Expenses in connection with such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party may
participate, through counsel chosen by it and at its own expense, in the
defense of any such Third-Party Claim as to which the Indemnified Party is
entitled to and does conduct and control the defense thereof and, in such
event, shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in connection with such
defense.

(k) Settlement of Third Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, with respect to any Third-Party Claim as to which the
Indemnifying Party is entitled to conduct the defense, the Indemnifying Party
shall not compromise or settle any such Third-Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not unreasonably
be withheld, delayed or conditioned. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the
defense pursuant to this Section 8.6, the Indemnified Party shall not, without
the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which written consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), compromise or settle any
such Third-Party Claim.



8.7 Exclusive Remedy; Recourse Generally Limited to Escrowed Funds.

(k) Exclusive Remedy. After the Closing, except for seeking equitable relief,
including specific performance to enforce the provisions of Section 4.8 as
provided in Section 4.8, a claim for indemnification pursuant to the
indemnification provisions of this Article VIII sets forth the sole and
exclusive monetary remedy of the Indemnified Party with respect to any claim
based upon, arising out of, or otherwise in respect of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (provided that the foregoing shall not be
interpreted to waive the rights or obligations of any party to any Related
Agreement). In furtherance thereof, Buyer, on behalf of itself and all the
Buyer Group Members, hereby waives from and after the Closing Date to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any and all other rights, claims, demands,
remedies and causes of action (including any based upon tort) seeking monetary
damages which any of them may have against Dohmen or its Affiliates, relating
to any matters arising or resulting from a breach of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, other than a claim for indemnification
pursuant to the indemnification provisions of this Article VIII (provided that
the foregoing shall not be interpreted to waive the rights or obligations of
any party to any Related Agreement). The provisions of this Section 8.7(a)
shall not apply to any fraud or intentional misrepresentation claim asserted
against the Indemnifying Party.

(l) Certain Claims Limited to Escrowed Funds. Except for any claim for
indemnification by any Buyer Group Member arising out of or in connection with
(i) any intentional misrepresentation or fraud of Dohmen, (ii) any breach of
or inaccuracy in the Fundamental Representations made by Dohmen, (iii) any
breach of or inaccuracy in a representation or warranty made by Dohmen in
either (A) Section 2.13 (Taxes) or (B) Section 2.14 (Employee Benefit Plans),
or (iv) the matters referred to in clauses (ii) through (vii) of Section
8.2(a) (collectively, the "Excluded Matters"), the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Buyer Group Members for indemnification under Section 8.2(a)(i) (other
than with respect to any Excluded Matter) and Section 8.2(a)(viii) shall be
recourse to the Escrowed Funds to the extent thereof (whether or not the same
are sufficient to satisfy all such Buyer Group Member's claims), and no more.
If any Buyer Group Member is entitled to indemnification arising out of or in
connection with any Excluded Matter, then the obligation to make such payment
shall not be limited to the Escrowed Funds but rather shall be satisfied (i)
from the available Escrowed Funds and to the extent thereof or (ii) from
Dohmen, as Buyer may elect (but, in no event shall Dohmen be required to
indemnify the Buyer Group Members with respect to such matters described in
this proviso in an amount (together with any amount paid from the Escrowed
Funds) greater than the Purchase Price).

8.8 Limitations on Indemnification. Indemnification under this Article VIII
shall be limited as follows:

(k) Limitation on Certain Types of Damages. No Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to indemnification for Losses or Expenses which consist of punitive
or exemplary damages, or damages of a type not reasonably foreseeable, except
to the extent such Losses or Expenses are payable to a Third Party in respect
of a Third-Party Claim.

(l) No Duplication. No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover, more
than once, the same Losses or Expenses that may have resulted from a breach of
more than one



representation, warranty, covenant or agreement hereunder arising from the
same facts and circumstances.

(m) Third Party Recoveries. No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification to the extent that such Indemnified Party is entitled to, and
actually receives, from any applicable insurance policy or other Third Party
source, any Third Party recovery (whether insurance proceeds, indemnity
recovery, or otherwise) in connection with such Indemnified Event; provided,
that any such reduction of the Indemnified Party's entitlement to
indemnification hereunder by virtue of this Section 8.8(c) shall be net of (i)
any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the applicable Indemnified Party
in connection with the collection of such Third Party recovery and (ii) any
increases in premiums under insurance policies expected to be attributable to
such recovery. The Indemnified Party shall take commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue such recoveries from any Third Party insurer and collect all
such amounts available to the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance
policies then in effect of such Indemnified Party. If any proceeds to be
netted hereunder with respect to such Losses and Expenses are actually
received by the Indemnified Party after payment by the Indemnifying Party of
any amounts otherwise required to be paid to an Indemnified Party pursuant to
this Article VIII with respect to such Losses and Expenses, then the
Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of the receipt of such
proceeds and pay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such receipt, any
amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have been required to pay
pursuant to this Article VIII with respect to such Losses and Expenses had
such proceeds been received at the time of such payment.

(n) Closing Date Working Capital. No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
any indemnification for or with respect to any Losses or Expenses to the
extent that the same were specifically reflected in and taken into account as
current liabilities in determining the Closing Date Working Capital pursuant
to Section 1.3.

8.9 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification payments
made under this Agreement will be treated by the parties as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable
Laws.

ARTICLE IX 
TERMINATION

9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing Date as follows:

(i) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Dohmen;

(j) by written notice given by either Buyer or Dohmen, if the Closing shall
not have been consummated by October 31, 2013 (the "Drop Dead Date");
provided, however that in order to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.1(b), the terminating Party shall not be the Party whose failure to
comply with or perform any covenant or obligation set forth in this Agreement
has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to
occur on or before such date;



(k) by written notice given to Dohmen by Buyer if: (i) any of the
representations and warranties of Dohmen contained in this Agreement shall be
inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement, or shall have become inaccurate
as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement, such that the condition
set forth in Section 7.1(a) would not be satisfied; (ii) any of the covenants
of Dohmen or RESTAT contained in this Agreement shall have been breached such
that the condition set forth in Section 7.1(b) would not be satisfied; or
(iii) any Material Adverse Effect on RESTAT or the Business shall have
occurred, or any event or other change, event, effect, claim, circumstance or
matter shall have occurred or circumstance or other change, event, effect,
claim, circumstance or matter shall exist that, in combination with any other
changes, events, effects, claims, circumstances or matters that have occurred
or shall exist, would reasonably be expected to have or result in a Material
Adverse Effect on RESTAT or the Business; provided, however, that, in the case
of clauses (i) and (ii) only, if an inaccuracy in any of the representations
and warranties of Dohmen as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement
or a breach of a covenant by Dohmen or RESTAT is curable by the applicable
Person through the use of reasonable efforts within ten (10) days after Buyer
notifies Dohmen in writing of the existence of such inaccuracy or breach (the
"Dohmen Cure Period"), then Buyer may not terminate this Agreement under this
Section 9.1(c) as a result of such inaccuracy or breach prior to the
expiration of the Dohmen Cure Period, provided that the applicable party,
during the Dohmen Cure Period, continues to exercise reasonable efforts to
cure such inaccuracy or breach (it being understood that Buyer may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(c) with respect to such
inaccuracy or breach if such inaccuracy or breach is cured prior to the
expiration of the Dohmen Cure Period);

(l) by written notice given to Buyer by Dohmen if: (i) any of Buyer's
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall be inaccurate
as of the date of this Agreement, or shall have become inaccurate as of a date
subsequent to the date of this Agreement, such that the condition set forth in
Section 7.2(a) would not be satisfied; or (ii) if any of Buyer's covenants
contained in this Agreement shall have been breached such that the condition
set forth in Section 7.2(b) would not be satisfied; provided, however, that if
an inaccuracy in any of Buyer's representations and warranties as of a date
subsequent to the date of this Agreement or a breach of a covenant by Buyer is
curable by Buyer through the use of reasonable efforts within ten (10) days
after Dohmen notifies Buyer in writing of the existence of such inaccuracy or
breach (the "Buyer Cure Period"), then Dohmen may not terminate this Agreement
under this Section 9.1(d) as a result of such inaccuracy or breach prior to
the expiration of the Buyer Cure Period, provided that Buyer, during the Buyer
Cure Period, continues to exercise reasonable efforts to cure such inaccuracy
or breach (it being understood that Dohmen may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) with respect to such inaccuracy or breach if
such inaccuracy or breach is cured prior to the expiration of the Buyer Cure
Period); or

(m) by written notice given by either Buyer or Dohmen, if any Governmental
Authority shall have enacted or promulgated any Law or Order which is in
effect and which has the effect of making the Closing illegal or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereof.



9.2 Effect of Termination. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, in
the event of any termination pursuant to Section 9.1, written notice thereof
shall be promptly given in accordance with Section 10.6 by the Party seeking
termination to the other Parties and such termination shall be immediately
effective and this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no
liability or obligation on the part of Buyer, Dohmen, RESTAT or any of their
respective Affiliates or their respective directors, officers or other
employees or shareholders, if applicable; provided, however, that each Party
shall remain liable for any intentional breach of this Agreement that occurred
prior to its termination; and provided, further that those obligations set
forth in the Confidentiality Agreement and those obligations set forth in this
Section 9.2, Section 9.3 and Article X (other than Section 10.1 and Section
10.12) shall survive any such termination.

9.3 Return of Transaction Documents. Upon any such termination of this
Agreement, each Party will, upon request of the other Party, redeliver to such
other Party or destroy all documents, work papers and other materials of such
other Party relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether obtained
before or after the execution of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Party's legal department may retain one copy of all such
documents, work papers and other materials to the extent relevant to
demonstrate compliance with any legal or fiduciary obligation, provided that
such retained copy shall not be made available by the legal department to any
non-legal personnel of such Party unless required by Law or in connection with
a dispute concerning the enforcement of this Agreement. Such retained copies
shall remain subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

ARTICLE X 
GENERAL PROVISIONS

10.1 Survival of Obligations. All representations, warranties, covenants and
obligations contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that the representations and warranties contained in Articles II and
III shall survive the Closing only for the applicable period set forth in
Section 8.4(a).

10.2 Benefit and Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries.

(h) This Agreement may not be assigned by Buyer without the prior written
consent of Dohmen, whether by merger, operation of law, or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may assign its rights hereunder to an
Affiliate of Buyer without the prior written consent of Dohmen; provided that
no assignment shall limit or affect, or relieve Buyer of, Buyer's obligations
hereunder. Following the Closing, Buyer may freely assign any or all of its
rights under this Agreement (including its indemnification rights under
Article VIII), in whole or in part, to any other Person without obtaining the
consent or approval of any other Party hereto or any other Person; provided
that no assignment shall limit or affect, or relieve Buyer of, Buyer's
obligations hereunder. This Agreement may not be assigned by Dohmen without
the prior written consent of Buyer, whether by merger, operation of law, or
otherwise. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Parties hereto, their permitted successors, assignees and beneficiaries in
interest.

(i) Except for Article VIII, which is intended to benefit, and to be
enforceable by, the Buyer Group Members and Seller Group Members, nothing in
this Agreement, expressed



or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other
than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns) any
right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

10.3 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of
Wisconsin (regardless of such State's conflict of laws principles), and
without reference to any rules of construction regarding the Party responsible
for the drafting hereof. Each Party (a) agrees that any suit, action or other
legal proceeding arising out of this Agreement may only be brought either in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, or in
the appropriate state court located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, (b) consents to
the exclusive jurisdiction of any such court in any such suit, action or
proceeding, (c) agrees that service of process or notice in any such suit,
action or proceeding shall be effective if delivered in compliance with
Section 10.6, and (d) waives any objection which such Party may have to the
laying of venue, personal jurisdiction, forum nonconveniens and improper
service of process (provided such service of process is in accordance with
Section 10.6) of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court. FOR
ANY PROCEEDING WHICH IS BROUGHT TO ENFORCE, CHALLENGE OR CONSTRUE THE TERMS OR
MAKING OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN SUCH PROCEEDING. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT IN ANY SUCH
PROCEEDING, THE MATTERS SHALL BE TRIED BY A COURT AND NOT BY A JURY.

10.4 Enforcement. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedies available at Law,
the Parties hereto shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States or Wisconsin
specified in Section 10.3.

10.5 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, each Party shall be
responsible for and shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by it in
connection with (a) the performance of and compliance with all transactions,
agreements and conditions contained in this Agreement or the Related
Agreements to be performed or complied with by it including legal, accounting

approval, ratification, waiver, order or authorization from any Person
(including any Governmental Authority) required to be obtained in connection
with any of such transactions, and (c) the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, Dohmen shall pay all
RESTAT Transaction Costs and shall not charge any to RESTAT. Further, Buyer
shall pay all filing fees and costs required under the HSR Act.

10.6 Notices. Any and all notices, requests, demands, waiver, consent,
approval or other communications provided for herein or made hereunder shall

Party as such Party

10.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two or
more counterparts (including by facsimile), each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument, provided that all such counterparts, in the aggregate, shall
contain the signatures of all Parties hereto. The exchange of a fully executed
Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission or in PDF
format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the Parties.

10.8 Amendment, Modification and Waiver. This Agreement may be modified,
amended or supplemented at any time prior to the Closing Date by mutual
written agreement of Buyer and Dohmen. Any Party may waive in writing any term
or condition contained in this Agreement and intended to be for its benefit;
provided, however, that no waiver by any Party,



whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed
or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such term or condition.

10.9 Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest. This Agreement, the Related
Agreements, and the Exhibits and Schedules delivered herewith, together with
the Confidentiality Agreement, represent the full and complete agreement of
the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede and
replace any prior understandings and agreements (written or oral) among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof (other than the
Confidentiality Agreement); provided, however, that the Confidentiality
Agreement shall not be superseded by this Agreement and shall remain in effect
in accordance with its terms until the earlier of (a) the Closing or (b) the
date on which the Confidentiality Agreement is terminated or expires in
accordance with its terms.

10.10 Publicity. The Parties agree that no public announcements or disclosures
of any kind concerning the terms of this Agreement or concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be made without the consent
of Buyer and Dohmen, except as and to the extent that any such Party shall be
so obligated by Law, the rules of any stock exchange upon which the securities
of Buyer are listed, in which case the other Party shall be advised in advance
(to the extent reasonably practicable or as promptly as reasonably practicable
thereafter) and Buyer and Dohmen shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued;
provided, that the foregoing shall not preclude communications or disclosures
necessary to implement the provisions of this Agreement or to comply with
accounting and Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure obligations.

10.11 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
determined to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of Law or public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutual acceptable manner in order that the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

10.12 Further Assurances. From time to time, as and when requested by any
Party, the other Parties shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to
be taken, all such further or other actions, as such Party may reasonably deem
necessary or desirable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Related Agreement and to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from time to time
following the Closing, Dohmen shall execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, to Buyer such other instruments of conveyance and
transfer as Buyer may reasonably request or as may be otherwise necessary to
more effectively convey and transfer to Buyer the Membership Interests. Dohmen
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide customary financial
information regarding RESTAT and cooperate in the preparation of pro forma and
interim financial information for filing with, and request and, conditioned
upon Buyer's and Dohmen's execution of such indemnity agreements,
certifications and other undertakings as RESTAT's independent auditor may
reasonably require, obtain the consent



of RESTAT's independent auditor for use of their reports in, any applicable
Securities and Exchange Commission filings of Buyer and its Affiliates.

10.13 Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence in the performance by any
Party of its obligations hereunder.

10.14 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

10.15 Disclosure Schedules. The representations and warranties contained in
Article II are qualified by reference to the Schedules attached hereto. Buyer
acknowledges that (i) the Schedules may include items or information that
Dohmen is not required to disclose under this Agreement and (ii) inclusion of
information in the Schedules shall not be construed as an admission that such
information is material to RESTAT. Similarly, in such matters where a
representation or warranty is given or other information is provided, the
disclosure of any matter in the Schedules shall not imply that any other
undisclosed matter having a greater value or other significance is material.

10.16 Interpretation. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) the words "include",
"includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation," (ii) the word "or" is not exclusive, (iii) the words
"herein", "hereof", "hereby", "hereto" and "hereunder" refer to this Agreement
as a whole, (iv) references to the plural include the singular, and references
to the singular include the plural, (v) references to written notices or

otherwise requires, references herein: (i) to Articles, Sections, Appendices,
Exhibits and Schedules mean the Articles and Sections of, and the Exhibits and
Schedules attached to, this Agreement; (ii) to an agreement, instrument or
other document means such agreement, instrument or other document as amended,
supplemented and modified from time to time to the extent permitted by the
provisions thereof and by this Agreement; and (iii) to a statute means such
statute as in effect from time to time and includes any successor legislation
thereto and any regulations promulgated thereunder. The Schedules, Appendices
and Exhibits referred to herein shall be construed with and as an integral
part of this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim
herein. Titles to Articles and headings of Sections are inserted for
convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed a part of or to affect
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. This Agreement and the
Related Agreements shall be construed without regard to any presumption or
rule requiring construction or interpretation against the party drafting an
instrument or causing any instrument to be drafted.
