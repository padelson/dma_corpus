legally bound, agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

 _The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

 



 

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger
(sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " ** _Surviving Corporation_** "),
and the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all of its rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by
the Merger, except as set forth in _Article II_. The Merger shall have the
effects specified in the WBCA.

 



 

1.2. _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing of the Merger (the " ** _Closing_** ") shall
take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd
Street, New York, New York 10019, at 9:00 a.m. (New York time) on the third
Business Day following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of
the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in
accordance with this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " **
_Business Day_** " means any day ending at 11:59 p.m. (New York time) other
than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which (a) banks in the County of New
York, New York are required or authorized by Law to close or (b) solely for
purposes of determining the Closing Date, the Department of State of the State
of Washington is required or authorized by Law to close. The date on which the
Closing actually occurs is referred to as the " ** _Closing Date_**."

 



 

1.3. _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company and Parent will file articles of merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Washington in such form as is required by, and executed and
acknowledged in accordance with Section 23B.11.050 of the WBCA (the " **
_Washington Articles of Merger_** "), and shall make all other filings and
recordings, and deliver and tender, or cause to be delivered or tendered, as
applicable, any Taxes and fees, required under the WBCA to effect the Merger.
The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Washington Articles of
Merger have been duly filed

 



     

 

 



 

with and accepted by the Secretary of State of the State of Washington or at
such later time as may be agreed by the Parties in writing and specified in
the Washington Articles of Merger (the " ** _Effective Time_** ").

 



 

ARTICLE II

 



 

 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws 
of the Surviving Corporation_

 



 

2.1. _Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation_. At the
Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in their
entirety as of the Effective Time to be in the same form as set forth in
_Exhibit A_ to this Agreement, and as so amended shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " ** _Charter_** ") until
thereafter amended as provided therein or as provided by applicable Law and
consistent with the obligations set forth in _Section 6.12_.

 



 

2.2. _Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. Subject to the requirements of
_Section 6.12_, the Parties shall take all actions necessary so that the
bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the " ** _Bylaws_** "), except
that references to Merger Subs name shall be replaced with references to the
Surviving Corporations name, until thereafter amended as provided therein, by
the Charter or as provided by applicable Law and consistent with the
obligations set forth in _Section 6.12_.

 



 

ARTICLE III

 



 

 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_

 



 

3.1. _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. Immediately prior to the
Closing, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent
the resignation of each member of the Company Board, in each case, effective
as of the Closing. The Parties shall take all actions necessary so that the
directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their
successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the WBCA, the Charter
and the Bylaws.

 



 

3.2. _Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The Parties shall take all
actions necessary so that the officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time
shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the WBCA, the Charter and the Bylaws.

 



     

 

 



 

ARTICLE IV

 



 

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; 
Exchange of Share Certificates_

 



 

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company:

 



 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.005 per
share, of the Company (the " ** _Shares_** ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent and Shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third
parties and (ii) Shares that are owned by shareholders of the Company (other
than Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent) who did not vote in favor of this Agreement or the
Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who exercise dissenters rights
when and in the manner required under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA (the Shares
referred to in _clause (ii)_, " ** _Dissenting Shares_** ," and the Shares
referred to in _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , collectively, " ** _Excluded
Shares_** ")) shall be converted into the right to receive $16.50 per Share in
cash, without interest (the " ** _Merger Consideration_** "). At the Effective
Time, all of the Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Section 4.1(a)_ shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate
formerly representing any of the Shares (each, a " ** _Share Certificate_** ")
or otherwise if the Company then has Shares which are not certificated, the
applicable number of uncertificated Shares represented by book-entry (the " **
_Book-Entry Shares_** ") (in each case, other than Excluded Shares) shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Excluded Shares; Treatment of Certain Parent
Owned Shares_. Each Excluded Share owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, and in each case not held on behalf of
third parties, shall remain outstanding as a validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each other
Excluded Share shall, by virtue of the Merger and any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without any action on the part of the
holder of such Excluded Share, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without
payment of any consideration therefor and cease to exist, subject to any
rights the holder thereof may have under _Section 4.2(g)_.

 



 

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, without par value, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to
exist.

 



 

4.2. _Exchange of Share Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Appointment of Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Sub shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to serve as the paying agent (the " ** _Paying Agent_** ") and shall
enter into an agreement reasonably

 



     

 

 



 

acceptable to the Company relating to the Paying Agents responsibilities with
respect to this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or
Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash
in U.S. Dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (other
than in respect of Excluded Shares) under _Section 4.1(a)_ (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " ** _Payment Fund_** "). The Payment Fund
shall not be used for any purpose other than a purpose expressly provided for
in this Agreement. Pending its disbursement in accordance with this _Section
4.2_, the Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent, if so directed
by Parent or Merger Sub. Any such investment, if made, must be made in (i)
short-term direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) short-term
obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii)
short-term commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by either Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Services, respectively,
or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers
acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion. Parent
shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly replace or restore
the cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all
times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make all
payments of Merger Consideration in accordance herewith. No investment losses
resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall
diminish the rights of any holder of Shares to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided herein. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investment (if any) in excess of the amounts payable pursuant to _Section
4.2(c)_ and _Section 4.3(c)_ shall be promptly returned to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as determined by Parent in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the Paying Agent Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 



 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five Business
Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail or otherwise provide to each holder of record of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) (A) a notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of
the Merger, (B) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Share Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Share Certificates as
provided in _Section 4.2(f)_) or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares not held,
directly or indirectly, through The Depository Trust Company (" ** _DTC_** ")
to the Paying Agent, such materials to be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent desires with approval of the Company (such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the " ** _Letter of
Transmittal_** "), and (C) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Share Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Share Certificates as
provided in _Section 4.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent in
exchange for payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) With respect to Book-Entry Shares held, directly or indirectly, through
DTC, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the
Paying Agent, DTC, DTCs nominees and such other necessary or desirable third-
party intermediaries to ensure that the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or
its nominees as promptly as practicable

 



     

 

 



 

after the Effective Time, upon surrender of Shares held of record by DTC or
its nominees in accordance with DTCs customary surrender procedures and such
other procedures as agreed by Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent, DTC,
DTCs nominees and such other necessary or desirable third-party
intermediaries, the Merger Consideration to which the beneficial owners
thereof are entitled to receive as a result of the Merger pursuant to this
_Article IV_.

 



 

(iii) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Shares that (A) are Share
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Share Certificates as
provided in _Section 4.2(f)_) together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent in
accordance with the terms of the materials and instructions provided by the
Paying Agent, (B) are Book-Entry Shares not held through DTC, by book-receipt
of an "agents message" in customary form by the Paying Agent in connection
with the surrender of Book-Entry Shares (or such other reasonable evidence, if
any, of surrender with respect to such Book-Entry Shares, as the Paying Agent
may reasonably request), in each case of the foregoing _clauses (A)_ and
_(B)_ of this _Section 4.2(c)(iii)_, pursuant to such materials and
instructions as contemplated by _Section 4.2(c)(i)_, and (C) are Book-Entry
Shares held, directly or indirectly, through DTC, in accordance with DTCs
customary surrender procedures and such other procedures as agreed to by the
Company, Parent, the Paying Agent, DTC, DTCs nominees and such other
necessary or desirable third-party intermediaries pursuant to _Section
4.2(c)(ii)_, the holder of such Share Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Paying Agent shall be
required to deliver to each such holder, a check in the amount (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 4.2(h)_) of
cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_.

 



 

(iv) No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon surrender
of any Shares.

 



 

(v) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, or if the consideration payable is to
be paid in a name other than that in which the Share Certificates surrendered
or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer
records of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of
the Share Certificates may be issued to such transferee if the Share
Certificates formerly representing such Shares are (as applicable) properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and presented to the
Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable, in each case, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Paying Agent.

 



 

(vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of
Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Share Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
_Article IV_. Payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to
Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer records of the Company.

 



      

 

 



 

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Share Certificate or acceptable evidence of a Book-Entry Share is
presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for
transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in
immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled to receive
as a result of the Merger pursuant to this _Article IV_.

 



 

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments of the Payment Fund) that remains unclaimed
by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Share Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares by the 180th day following the Effective Time shall be delivered
to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as determined by Parent. Any holder of
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this
_Article IV_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 4.2(h)_) upon delivery of the Share
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Share Certificates as
provided in _Section 4.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former
holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws; _provided_
, _however_ , that to the fullest extent permitted by Law, immediately prior
to the date any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority, such Merger Consideration shall become
the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term " ** _Person_** " means any individual, corporation
(including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental
Authority or other entity of any kind or nature, and each such individual or
entitys successors or permitted assigns.

 



 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Share Certificates_. In the event any Share
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Share Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond reasonably sufficient to indemnify Parent and the Surviving
Corporation against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Share Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Share Certificate a check
in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 4.2(h)_) equal to the number of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Share
Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(g) _Dissenting Shares_. Subject to the third sentence of this _Section
4.2(g)_, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration but instead such holder shall be entitled to only
such rights as are granted with respect to the payment of the fair value of
such shares under the applicable provisions of Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA. At
the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with

 



     

 

 



 

respect thereto, except the rights provided for pursuant to the applicable
provisions of Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or
lose any such right under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to dissent and
obtain payment for the holders shares under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA, then
such right of such holder under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA shall cease and
such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to convert (or have been converted) at
the Effective Time into, and shall become, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 4.1(a)_, without any interest thereon.
The Company shall give Parent prompt notice and copies of any written notices
(or of any threats with respect thereto) that the Company receives from or on
behalf of its shareholders to exercise dissenters rights in respect of any
Shares, attempted withdrawals of such notices and any other instruments served
pursuant to Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA and received by the Company relating to
shareholders dissenters rights, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for fair value under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA, including any
determination to make payment or deposit with respect to any of the holders of
Dissenting Shares with respect to any of their Dissenting Shares under Chapter
23B.13 of the WBCA prior to the entry of judgment in the Actions regarding
payment demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment or deposit with respect to, or settle, or offer or
agree to settle, any such demand or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands, or agree, authorize or commit to any of the foregoing. Any Merger
Consideration made available to the Paying Agent to exchange for Shares for
which dissenters rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon
demand.

 



 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the " ** _Code_** "), or any other applicable federal, state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
timely remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority, such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

4.3. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each then
outstanding option to purchase Shares (a " ** _Company Option_** "), whether
vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, fully vest and shall be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive (without interest), at the time of the first regularly
scheduled payroll date that is at least five Business Days following the
Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of
Shares subject to the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
_multiplied by_ (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration
_over_ (B) the exercise price per Share of such Company Option. Each Company
Option for which the exercise price per Share is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration shall be cancelled at the Closing without payment of
consideration.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Company RSU Awards_. At the Effective Time, each then
outstanding restricted stock unit award corresponding to Shares (a " **
_Company RSU Award_** ") shall, automatically and without any required action
on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right
to receive (without interest), at the time of the first regularly scheduled
payroll date that is at least five Business Days following the Effective Time
(or at such later time as would not result in the imposition of a penalty
under Section 409A of the Code), an amount in cash equal to the product of (i)
the number of Shares subject to such Company RSU Award _multiplied by_ (ii)
the Merger Consideration. For any performance-based Company RSU Award, the
number of Shares subject to such Company RSU Award under _clause (i)_ of the
immediately preceding sentence shall equal: (x) for Company RSU Awards
(2017-2019 performance cycle), thirty three percent (33%) of the number of
Shares earned based on target performance and (y) for Company RSU Awards
(2018-2020 and 2019-2021 performance cycles), one hundred percent (100%) of
the number of Shares earned based on target performance.

 



 

(c) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the compensation committee of the Board, as applicable,
shall adopt any resolutions and take any other actions that are necessary to
(i) effectuate the treatment of the Company Equity Awards pursuant to
_Sections 4.3(a)_ and _4.3(b)_ , (ii) cause the Stock Plans to terminate at
or prior to the Effective Time and (iii) ensure that from and after the
Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required
to deliver Shares or other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant
to or in settlement of Company Equity Awards. The Surviving Corporation shall
pay through its payroll systems the amounts due pursuant to _Section 4.3(a)_
and _Section 4.3(b)_.

 



 

4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement to the earlier
of the Effective Time and termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article VIII_, the number of Shares or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares shall have been changed into a
different number of Shares or securities, or a different class, by reason of
any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization or other similar transaction, the
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to provide the holders of
Shares and Company Equity Awards with the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ that nothing in this
_Section 4.4_ shall be construed to permit the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company to take any action otherwise prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company is qualified to do business and is
in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept or

or to have such power or authority, would not reasonably be expected to (i)
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or (ii)
prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has made

outstanding shares of capital stock or other voting securities of each of the
Companys Subsidiaries are owned by the Company or by a direct or indirect

with respect to the Company described in the immediately preceding sentence)

any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over

consistent basis during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein
or in the notes thereto.

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken, or agreed, committed, arranged,
authorized or entered into any other binding arrangement to take, any action
that, if taken on or after the date of this Agreement, would (without Parents
prior written consent) have constituted a breach of any of the covenants set

owner, directly or indirectly, in one or a series of related transactions, of
25% or more of the total voting power of any class of equity securities of the
Company, or those of any of its Subsidiaries or assets, in each case,

written Acquisition Proposal that did not arise from a breach of the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.2_, either the Company Board (acting

Company negotiates (and causes its officers, employees, financial advisors and
outside legal counsel to negotiate) in good faith with Parent (to the extent

the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee, as
applicable, not to effect a Change of Recommendation in response thereto, and
at the end of the four Business Day period, prior to taking action to effect a
Change of Recommendation, the Company Board (acting on the recommendation of

Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations owed by
the Company Board to the Companys shareholders under applicable Law;

Event, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent

whether judicial or administrative, is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted), including any proceeding by any Governmental Authority or private
party, challenging the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this

Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to) use their respective reasonable best efforts to
resolve any such objections, including by proposing, negotiating, committing

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall Parent or the Company or their respective
Affiliates be obligated to, and neither the "reasonable best efforts" standard
nor any other provision set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed to
require, or be construed to require, Parent or the Company or their respective
Affiliates or Subsidiaries to resist, vacate, limit, reverse, suspend, defend
or prevent, in each case through litigation, any actual Action or Order
brought by any Governmental Authority against any Party seeking to prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the Merger and any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or to undertake any actions
that would constitute a Substantial Detriment. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent may at its sole discretion compel the Company to (and to cause its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to) agree to any such term or condition or take
any such actions (or agree to take such actions) so long as the effectiveness
of such term or condition or action is conditioned upon the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
furtherance of and subject to its obligations pursuant to this _Section _6.6,
Parent shall have final decision-making authority on relevant strategy,
timing, and the conduct of the Parties interactions with any Governmental

reasonable inquiry by Parent or its Subsidiaries or its or their
Representatives, (III) such information was independently developed by Parent
or its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives without violating any of
its obligations under this _Section 6.7(b)_ and without use of, reference to

other compensation and benefits provided to such Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Additionally, Parent agrees that each
Continuing Employee who is involuntarily terminated within 12 months following

favorable than those that would have been provided to such Continuing Employee

separation agreement or other arrangement in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, in each case as listed on _Section 5.1(l)(i)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (each, a " ** _Company Severance Plan_** "), under
circumstances that would have given the Continuing Employee a right to
severance payments and benefits under such Company Severance Plan.

 



 

(b) Parent shall (i) cause any pre-existing conditions (for any condition for
which the Continuing Employee would have been entitled to coverage under the
corresponding Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated

with respect to the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, to the
extent permitted by insurance arrangements with third parties, (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the amount of eligible expenses

corresponding benefit plans of Parent and its Affiliates for the plan year in
which the Effective Time occurs and (iii) any of its (or its Affiliates)
employee benefit plans (including disability pay continuation plans) in which
the Continuing Employees are entitled to participate to take into account for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and, under any vacation, sick,

service shall be required to be credited for purposes of determining credited
service or eligibility under any severance plan or to the extent it would
result in a duplication of benefits), service by such Continuing Employees to

at the time of the first regularly scheduled payroll date that is at least
five Business Days following the Effective Time, each Continuing Employee then

on actual performance for the full performance period as estimated based on
the latest available information for the last complete calendar month prior to
the Closing Date as determined by the Company in good faith consultation with
Parent and consistent with the terms of the Company Bonus Plans and (ii) a
fraction, the numerator of which shall equal the number of days in the
calendar year through the Closing Date and the denominator of which is 365;
provided that for purposes of clause (i), the Company may account for (x) any
seasonality in the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries when
determining performance and (y) the transactions contemplated by the Agreement
and any costs and expenses associated with the transactions contemplated by
the Agreement or any nonrecurring charges that would not reasonably be

performance targets and/or determining the achievement of applicable
performance targets under such plans.

 



 

(d) If the Closing occurs on or by December 31, 2021, the Company shall pay,
at the time of the first regularly scheduled payroll date that is at least
five Business Days following the Effective Time, each Continuing Employee then
participating in any Company Bonus Plan, a bonus equal to the product of (i)
the Continuing Employees full-year bonus entitlement under all such Company
Bonus Plans for 2021, based on actual performance for the full performance
period as estimated based on the latest available information for the last
complete calendar month prior to the Closing Date as determined by the Company

its Subsidiaries when determining performance and (y) the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement and any costs and expenses associated with the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement or any nonrecurring charges that

addition, for six years following the Effective Time, Parent shall and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to cause the certificates of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification and exculpation that are at least as favorable as the
indemnification and exculpation provisions contained in the certificates of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
for six years following the Effective Time in any respect, except as required
by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies for
the extension of (i) the directors and officers liability coverage of the
Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies and (ii) the
Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a
claims

 



     

 

 



 

reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time (the " ** _Tail Period_** ") from one or more insurance
carriers with the same or better credit rating as the Companys insurance
carrier as of the date of this Agreement (or, if no such policies are
available from insurance carriers with such credit rating, from insurance
carriers with the next-highest credit rating then capable of providing such
policies) with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " ** _D andO Insurance_**") with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are substantially
equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate to the
insureds as the Companys existing policies. If the Company and the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for the Tail
Period the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
to the insureds as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date
of this Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable DandO Insurance for the Tail
Period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at
least as favorable to the insureds as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that in no event shall
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies
pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the
aggregate annual premiums paid by the Company as of the date of this Agreement
for such insurance (or to pay an aggregate amount exceeding 300% of such
aggregate annual premiums to purchase the "tail" insurance policies
contemplated for the first sentence of this _Section 6.12(c)_); and
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage (or amount in respect of such "tail" insurance policies, as
applicable) exceeds such applicable amount, the Surviving Corporation shall
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.12_ shall survive the Closing and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each Indemnified Party,
and nothing in this Agreement shall affect, and the rights of each Indemnified
Party under this _Section 6.12_ shall be in addition to, any indemnification
rights that any such Indemnified Party may have under the certificates of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
Contract or applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the obligations under this _Section 6.12_ shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party
without the consent of such Indemnified Party.

 



 

(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any of their
respective successors or assigns) shall consolidate or merge with any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in
such consolidation or merger, or transfers at least 50% of its properties and
assets to any other Person, then in each case proper provision shall be made
so that the continuing or surviving corporation or entity (or its successors
or assigns, if applicable), or transferee of such assets, as the case may be,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.12_.

 



 

6.13. _Shareholder Litigation_. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly
notify the other of any shareholder litigation against it or any of its
Representatives arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Merger and
any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall keep the other
reasonably informed regarding any such shareholder

 



     

 

 



 

litigation. Until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article VIII_, the Company shall provide Parent (a) an opportunity to review
and to propose comments to all filings or written responses to be made by the
Company in connection with any shareholder litigation against the Company and
its directors relating to any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and
the Company shall give reasonable and good-faith consideration to any comments
proposed by Parent and (b) give Parent the opportunity to otherwise
participate in the defense and/or settlement of any such litigation (in each
case at Parents expense) and shall consider in good faith Parents advice
with respect to such litigation. In no event shall the Company enter into,
agree to or disclose any settlement with respect to such shareholder
litigation without Parents consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 



 

6.14. _Other Actions by the Company_.

 



 

(a) _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger and any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and the Company Board shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

 



 

(b) _Section 16 Matters_. The Company and the Company Board (or a duly formed
committee thereof consisting of non-employee directors (as such term is
defined for the purposes of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act)),
shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all such actions as may be necessary
or appropriate to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by any individual who is subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law.

 



 

6.15. _Approval by Sole Stockholder of Merger Sub_. Immediately following
execution of this Agreement, Parent (directly or through its Subsidiaries)
shall cause the sole stockholder of Merger Sub to execute and deliver, in
accordance with applicable Law and its articles of incorporation and bylaws, a
written consent approving this Agreement in accordance with the WBCA.

 



 

6.16. _Special Committee_. Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Company shall, and each
shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take any action intended to cause
the Company to, without the consent of a majority of the then existing members
of the Special Committee, eliminate the Special Committee, revoke or diminish
the authority of the Special Committee or remove or cause the removal of any
director of the Company Board that is a member of the Special Committee either
as a director or member of such committee other than for cause. For the
avoidance of doubt, this _Section 6.16_ shall not apply to the filling, in
accordance with the provisions of the applicable organizational documents of
the Company, of any vacancies caused by the death, resignation or incapacity
of any such director; _provided_ that such director is independent and
disinterested with

 



     

 

 



 

respect to (i) the management of the Company and (ii) the Merger and any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated by 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on November 11, 2020 (the " **
_Initial Outside Date_** "), _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement and abandon the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) shall not be
available to any Party whose action or failure to comply with its obligations
under this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or has primarily resulted
in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that (x) if on the Initial Outside Date, all the conditions to
Closing, other than the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section
7.1(c)_ (to the extent relating to an Antitrust Law), shall have been

(e) by Parent, if there has been a breach by the Company of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement,

before or after the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement and abandon the Merger
and any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(e)_ shall not be available to Parent if it is in material breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement;

 



 

(f) by the Company, if there has been a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement,

this Agreement and abandon the Merger and any other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or (ii) three Business Days prior to the Outside Date),
whether before or after the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement and
abandon the Merger and any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(f)_ shall not be available to the Company if it
is in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
set forth in this Agreement;

Company pays or causes to be paid to Parent the Company Termination Fee due by

8.2. _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

 



 

(a) In the event the Company or Parent intends to terminate this Agreement and
abandon the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1_, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall give

Parties (as the case may be) specifying the provision or provisions of this
Agreement pursuant to which such termination and abandonment is intended to be
effected.

 



 

(b) Except to the extent provided in _Sections 8.2(c)_, _8.2(d)_ , _8.2(e)_ ,
_8.2(f)_ and _8.2(g)_ , in the event of termination of this Agreement and the
abandonment of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall become void
and of no effect with no liability to any Person on the part of any Party (or
of any of its or their respective Representatives or Affiliates); _provided_
that (i) no such termination shall relieve any Party of any liability or
damages to the other Parties resulting from any fraud or willful and material
breach of its obligations set forth in this Agreement and (ii) the provisions
set forth in _Section 6.7(c)_, this _Section 8.2_ and _Article IX_ (and any
related definitions thereto) shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
For purposes of this Agreement, " ** _willful and material breach_** " means a
material breach that is a consequence of an action undertaken by the breaching
Party or the failure by the breaching Party to take an action it is required
to take under this Agreement, with knowledge that the taking of or failure to
take such action would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a
material breach of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Subject to _Section 8.2(f)_, in the event that this Agreement is
terminated:

 



 

(i) (A) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ (
_Company Vote Not Obtained_ );

 



 

(B) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made publicly or announced to the
Company or the Company Board which Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn

five (5) days prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, or termination of
this Agreement; and

 



 

(C) within nine months after such termination, the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company shall have consummated a transaction contemplated by an
Acquisition Proposal or shall have entered into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that, for
purposes of this _Section 8.2(c)_, the references to "25%" in the definition
of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "50%";

 



 

(ii) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_ ( _Company Recommendation_ ); or

 



 

(iii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_ ( _Superior Proposal_ );

 



 

then, (1) in the case of _Section 8.2(c)(i)_, within two Business Days after
the earlier of consummation of such Acquisition Proposal and entry into such
Alternative Acquisition Agreement, (2) in the case of _Section 8.2(c)(ii)_,
within two Business Days after termination of this Agreement and (3) in the
case of _Section 8.2(c)(iii)_, prior to termination of this Agreement, the
Company shall pay or cause to be paid a termination fee of $9,000,000 (the "
** _Company Termination Fee_** ") to Parent by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) Subject to _Section 8.2(f)_, in the event this Agreement is terminated
(i) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ and as of the
Outside Date one or more of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section
7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(c)_ (in the case of _Section 7.1(c)_, solely to the
extent such conditions have not been satisfied due to an Order or injunction
arising under any Antitrust Law) or (ii) by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)_ (solely to the extent the right to terminate relates to an
Order or injunction arising under any Antitrust Law), then, within two
Business Days after termination of this Agreement, Parent shall pay or cause
to be paid to the Company a termination fee of $15,000,000 (the " ** _Parent
Termination Fee_** " by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by the Company. Solely with respect to clause
(i) of this _Section 8.2(d)_, the term "Outside Date" shall mean the later of
(1) three Business Days prior to the Outside Date, as defined in Section
8.1(b) and (2), if Parent has waived completely or agreed to reduce the three
Business Day period referred to in _Section 1.2_, the Outside Date as defined
in _Section 8.1(b)_ or the date corresponding to such reduced period of time
prior to the Outside Date as defined in _Section 8.1(b)_.

 



 

(e) Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, no Party would have entered into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to timely pay Parent or
Company any amount due pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)_ or _Section 8.2(d)_, as
applicable (any such amount due, a " ** _Termination Payment_** "), and, to
obtain such payment, the Party owed a Termination Payment commences a suit
that results in a judgment against the Party owing the applicable Termination
Payment, the owing Party shall pay to the owed Party its costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest thereon at the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_
(or if not reported therein, as reported in another authoritative source
reasonably selected by the owed Party) in effect on the date such Termination
Payment was required to be paid from such date through the date of full
payment thereof; _provided_ that if such suit does not result in a judgment
against the owing Party, the owed Party shall pay to the owing Party its costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit.

 



 

(f) In no event shall a Party be required to pay a Termination Payment on more
than one occasion. Except in the event of fraud or willful and material
breach, if a Termination Payment is required to be, and is, paid pursuant to
this _Section 8.2_, the receiving Partys right to receive the applicable
Termination Payment and any additional amounts pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)_
shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of that Party and its Subsidiaries
and any of that Partys or its Subsidiaries respective former, current, or
future general or limited partners, shareholders, directors, officers,
managers, members, Affiliates, agents and other Representatives against the
other Party, the other Partys Subsidiaries and any of the other Partys or
its Subsidiaries respective former, current, or future general or limited
partners, shareholders, directors, officers, managers, members, Affiliates,
agents or other Representatives for any loss suffered as a result of any
breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the
Merger and any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated.

 



 

(g) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the Company Termination
Fee and Parent Termination Fee (the " ** _Termination Fees_** ") are not
intended to be penalties, but rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate Parent

 



     

 

 



 

or the Company, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such
Termination Fee is due and payable and which do not involve fraud or willful
and material breach, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
forgone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and
on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger and any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision.

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, this Agreement and any
action (whether at law, in contract or in tort) that may directly or
indirectly be based upon, relate to or arise out of this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby, or the negotiation, execution or performance
hereunder shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any choice or conflict of
law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware, _provided_ that matters related to (A)
_Article I_ and (B) the fiduciary duties of the Company Board shall be
governed by the Laws of the State of Washington. In addition, each of the
Parties (a) expressly submits to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the
courts of the State of Delaware and the federal courts of the United States of
America located in the State of Delaware (the " ** _Chosen Courts_** "), in
the event any dispute between the Parties (whether in contract, tort or
otherwise) arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, (b) expressly waives any claim of lack of personal jurisdiction or
improper venue and any claims that such courts are an inconvenient forum with
respect to such a claim, and (c) agrees that it shall not bring any claim,
action or proceeding against any other Parties relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the Chosen
Courts. Each Party hereby irrevocably consents to the service of process of
any of the aforementioned courts in any such suit, action or proceeding by the
mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail or by overnight
courier service, postage prepaid, to its address set forth in _Section 9.6_,
such service to become effective ten days after such mailing. EACH PARTY
HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM, ACTION OR PROCEEDING
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY (i) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (ii) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.5_.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the rights of each Party
to consummate the Merger and any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are special, unique and of extraordinary character and that if for
any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and
irreparable harm or damage would be caused for which money damages would not
be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each Party agrees that, in addition to any
other available remedies a Party may have in equity or at law, each Party
shall be entitled to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and to obtain an injunction restraining any breach or violation or
threatened breach or violation of the provisions of this Agreement without
necessity of posting a bond or other form of security. In the event that any
Action should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement, no Party shall

 



     

 

 



 

allege or assert, and each Party hereby waives the defense, that there is an
adequate remedy at law.

9.7. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits, annexes and
schedules hereto) and the documents and other agreements among the Parties as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure
Schedule, together with each other agreement entered into by or among any of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company as of the date of this Agreement that makes
reference to this _Section 9.7_, constitute the entire agreement among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all other
prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties, both written
and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

9.8. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in this _Section
9.8_, Parent and the Company hereby agree that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the
benefit of the other Parties, in accordance with and subject to the terms of
this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer
upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder,
including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth
herein; _provided_ that if, and only if, the Effective Time occurs, (a) the

on, _Section 4.1_ ( _Effect on Capital Stock_ ) and _Section 4.2_ (
_Exchange of Share Certificates_ ), (b) the holders of Company Equity Awards
shall be third-party beneficiaries of, and entitled to rely on, _Section 4.3_

agreements pursuant to any existing Contracts between the Parties or their

Distribution Agreement, dated as of May 1, 2011, by and between the Company

the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

 



 

9.13. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

9.14. _Interpretation; Construction_.

 



 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a
Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

 



 

(b) If a term is defined as one part of speech (such as a noun), it shall have
a corresponding meaning when used as another part of speech (such as a verb).
Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires otherwise, words
importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neutral genders
and vice versa, and the definitions of terms contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. The
words "includes" or "including" shall mean "including without limitation," the
words "hereof," "hereby," "herein," "hereunder" and similar terms in this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not any particular
section or article in which such words appear, the word "extent" in the phrase
"to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing
extends and such phrase shall not mean simply "if," any reference to a Law
shall include any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and any
reference to any Law in this Agreement shall mean such Law as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented.

 



     

 

 



 

Currency amounts referenced herein are in U.S. Dollars. Each reference to a
"wholly owned Subsidiary" or "wholly owned Subsidiaries" of a Person shall be
deemed to include any Subsidiary of such Person where all of the equity
interests of such Subsidiary are directly or indirectly owned by such Person
(other than directors qualifying shares, nominee shares or other equity
interests that are required by law or regulation to be held by a director or
nominee). To the extent this Agreement refers to information or documents
having been "provided to" or "made available to" Parent or Merger Sub by the
Company, such obligation shall be deemed satisfied if, as of the date of this
Agreement, (a) the Company or its Representatives made such information or
document available in any virtual data rooms established by or on behalf of
the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or otherwise made such information or document available (or delivered or
provided such information or document) to Parent or Merger Sub or its or their
Representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (b) such information or document is publicly available in the
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) database of the SEC
and not subject to any redactions or omissions.

 



 

(c) Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all references in this
Agreement to (i) any Contract, other agreement, document or instrument
(excluding this Agreement) mean such Contract, other agreement, document or
instrument as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in
accordance with the terms thereof and, unless otherwise specified therein,
include all schedules, annexes, addendums, exhibits and any other documents
attached thereto or incorporated therein by reference and (ii) this Agreement
mean this Agreement (taking into account the provisions of _Section 9.7_) as
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance
with _Section 9.2_.

 



 

(d) The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

 



 

9.15. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. No Party to this Agreement may assign
any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, by
operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other
Parties, except that Merger Sub may assign any and all of its rights under
this Agreement, by written notice to the Company, to another wholly owned
direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent to be a Constituent Corporation in
lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references to Merger Sub in this
Agreement shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary, except that all
representations and warranties made in this Agreement with respect to Merger
Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and
warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such
designation; _provided_ that (a) no assignment shall be permitted if such
assignment would, or would reasonably be expected to, prevent or materially
delay Parent or Merger Sub from performing their respective obligations under
this Agreement or consummating the Merger and any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) no assignment shall relieve Parent of any
of its obligations pursuant to this

 



     

 

 



 

Agreement and (c) no assignment shall relieve Merger Sub of its obligations
that are unperformed by its assignee. Any purported assignment in violation of
this Agreement is void.

domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit
plan, or other enterprise against Liability asserted against or incurred by
the individual in that capacity or arising from the individuals status as a

(d) If any provision of this paragraph or any application thereof shall be
