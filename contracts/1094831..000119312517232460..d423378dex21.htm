Section 2.1 _The Transactions_.

 

(a) _BP Sale_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Closing, the Partnership shall sell, assign, transfer and
convey to BGC Partners or its designated Subsidiary, and BGC Partners or its
designated Subsidiary shall purchase and acquire from the Partnership, all of
the BP Units, free and clear of any Liens (other than Permitted Liens), in
exchange for a payment of (i) Eight Hundred Seventy-Five Million Dollars
($875,000,000), _plus_ (ii) the Estimated Closing Net Assets Overage (if any),
_minus_ (iii) the Estimated Closing Net Assets Shortage (if

determined in accordance with _Section 2.2_, the " _BP Purchase Price_ "),
payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account designated by the Partnership in writing at least two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Partnership
may request prior to the Closing that BGC Partners or its designated
Subsidiary shall satisfy a portion of the BP Purchase Price by delivering (or
causing to be delivered) to one or more Selling Parties on behalf of the
Partnership a number of BGC Units requested by the Partnership, all of which
BGC Units shall be used to purchase and/or redeem, as applicable, all or a
portion of the limited partnership interests in the Partnership held by the
Selling Parties in accordance with the terms of the applicable Existing Sales
Agreements; _provided_ that in no event shall the value of BGC Units
delivered be in excess of Three Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($3,500,000). For the purpose of determining the portion of the BP Purchase
Price deemed satisfied by the delivery of a BGC Unit contemplated by the
immediately preceding sentence, the value of one BGC Unit shall be equal to
the BGC Stock Value.

(b) _BGC Investment and Cantor Investment._ Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, immediately following
the BP Sale: (i) BGC Partners shall, or shall cause its designated Subsidiary
to, purchase and acquire, and NewCo shall issue, sell and deliver to BGC
Partners or such designated Subsidiary newly issued Series A Units, as set
forth on _Schedule I_ hereto, with the rights, privileges and obligations set
forth in the NewCo Partnership Agreement, for an aggregate purchase price

account designated by NewCo in writing at least two (2) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date; and (ii) Cantor shall, or shall cause its designated
Subsidiary to, purchase and acquire, and NewCo shall issue, sell and deliver

forth in the NewCo Partnership Agreement, for an aggregate purchase price of
Two Hundred Sixty-Six Million, Six-Hundred Seventy Thousand Dollars
($266,670,000) (the " _Cantor Investment Purchase Price_ "), payable, at the
election of Cantor or its designated Subsidiary, in (A) cash by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account designated by NewCo in writing
at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (B) non-cash Assets
valued as of the Closing at their fair market value (as determined by standard
market practice for such non-cash Assets, including, if applicable, taking
into account any associated Liabilities of such non-cash Assets if it is
standard market practice to do so) or

 



-13- _ _ (C) a combination of the foregoing; _provided_ that in the case of
clauses (B) or (C) above, any such non-cash Assets shall primarily consist of
loans held for sale by the Partnership in the ordinary course of business
and, to the extent that such non-cash Assets are not loans held for sale by
the Partnership in the ordinary course of business, such non-cash Assets shall
be other assets held by the Partnership in the ordinary course of business.
In the event that a post-Closing audit determines that the actual fair market
value as of the Closing of any non-cash Asset contributed by Cantor or its
designated Subsidiary to NewCo is greater than the value used for such non-
cash Asset pursuant to clauses (B) or (C) of the immediately preceding
sentence, then NewCo shall promptly pay to Cantor or its designated Subsidiary
an amount in cash equal to such difference, and in the event that a post-
Closing audit determines that the actual fair market value as of the Closing
of any non-cash Asset contributed by Cantor or its designated Subsidiary to
NewCo is less than the value used for such non-cash Asset pursuant to clauses
(B) or (C) of the immediately preceding sentence, then Cantor or its
designated Subsidiary shall promptly pay to NewCo an amount in cash equal to
such difference. __

 

(c) _NewCo Partnership Agreement_. At the Closing, the applicable Parties will
amend and restate the Existing Partnership Agreement substantially in the
form of the NewCo Partnership Agreement attached as _Exhibit A_ hereto to
reflect the BGC Investment and the Cantor Investment and to otherwise set
forth the rights, privileges and obligations of the holders of the Series
A Units and the holders of the Series B Units.

Section 2.2 _BP Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Partnership
shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to BGC Partners a balance sheet (the
" _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ ") setting forth the Partnerships good-
faith estimate of the Closing Net Assets (the " _Estimated Closing Net Assets_
"), along with reasonable supporting documentation for the Partnerships
estimation. The Partnership shall provide BGC Partners with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Estimated Closing Net Assets and
shall consider in good faith any revisions to the Estimated Closing Net
Assets proposed by BGC Partners (it being understood that, in the event of any
disagreement among the Parties with respect to the Estimated Closing Net
Assets that is not resolved as of immediately prior to the Closing, the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet proposed by the Partnership shall be used at
the Closing to determine the Estimated BP Purchase Price pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)_). The Partnership shall give, and shall cause its advisors,
accountants and representatives to give, BGC Partners and its advisors,
accountants and representatives access to such books, records, work papers and
personnel of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably
necessary to understand the calculations set forth in the Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet.

(b) Within sixty (60) calendar days following the Closing Date, BGC Partners
shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Partnership a
statement (the " _Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet_ ") setting forth BGC
Partners calculation of the Closing Net Assets (the " _Adjusted Closing
Net Assets_ "). BGC Partners shall give, and shall cause its advisors,
accountants and representatives to give, the Partnership and its advisors,
accountants and representatives access to such books, records, work papers and
personnel of BGC Partners and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably necessary
to understand the calculations set forth in the Adjusted Closing Balance
Sheet.

 



-14- (c) The Partnership shall have thirty (30) calendar days from the date on
which the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet is delivered to it to assess the
preparation and confirm the accuracy of the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet and
the calculation of the Adjusted Closing Net Assets (the " _Review Period_ ").
If the Partnership believes in good faith that the Adjusted Closing Balance
Sheet or the calculation of the Adjusted Closing Net Assets is inaccurate, the
Partnership may, on or prior to the last day of the Review Period, deliver a
written notice to BGC Partners setting forth, in reasonable detail, each
disputed item or amount and the basis for the Partnerships disagreement
therewith, together with supporting calculations and documentation (the "
_Dispute Notice_ "). If the Partnership does not deliver to BGC Partners a
Dispute Notice on or prior to the last day of the Review Period, then the
Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet and the Adjusted Closing Net Assets shall be
final and binding on the Parties.

 

(d) If the Partnership delivers to BGC Partners a Dispute Notice on or prior
to the last day of the Review Period, the Partnership and BGC Partners shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any disputes identified in such Dispute
Notice. If the Partnership and BGC Partners agree in writing on resolution of
all disputes properly identified in such Dispute Notice, then the
Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet and the Adjusted Closing Net Assets, each as
modified by such agreement of the Partnership and BGC Partners, shall be final
and binding on the Parties. If the Partnership and BGC Partners are unable to
resolve all disputed items in such Dispute Notice within fifteen (15)
calendar days after the Partnerships delivery of such Dispute Notice to BGC
Partners, they shall promptly thereafter cause an internationally recognized
independent accounting firm mutually agreeable to the Partnership and BGC
Partners (the " _Accounting Referee_ ") to promptly review this Agreement and
the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating the Adjusted
Closing Net Assets. In making such calculation, the Accounting Referee shall
consider only those items or amounts as to which the Partnership and BGC
Partners have disagreed and must be based solely in accordance with the terms
and provisions of this Agreement. The calculation by the Accounting Referee
with respect to the disputed items shall not exceed the greater of, or be less
than the lesser of, the amounts proposed by the Partnership and BGC Partners,
as the case may be. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to the Partnership
and BGC Partners a report setting forth such calculation. The Partnership and
BGC Partners shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Accounting
Referee to deliver such report within thirty (30) calendar days following
appointment of the Accounting Referee. Such report shall be final and binding
upon the Parties, absent manifest error. The cost of such review and report
shall be borne in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the items
unsuccessfully disputed by each (as finally determined by the Accounting
Referee) bears to the total amount of the disputed items. The Partnership and
BGC Partners shall promptly reimburse the other to the extent that the other
paid more than the amount so required pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence. The Partnership and BGC Partners will, and will cause their
respective independent accountants to, cooperate and assist in the calculation
of the Adjusted Closing Net Assets and in the conduct of the review by
the Accounting Referee pursuant to this _Section 2.2_, including the making
available to the extent necessary of books, records, work papers and
personnel. The date on which the Adjusted Closing Net Assets is finally
determined in accordance with this _Section 2.2_ is referred as to the "
_Determination Date_."

(e) If the Adjusted Closing Net Assets as finally determined in accordance
with this _Section 2.2_ is less than the Estimated Closing Net Assets, then
the Partnership shall deliver such difference to BGC Partners within five (5)
Business Days after the Determination Date by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by BGC Partners.

 



-15- (f) If the Adjusted Closing Net Assets as finally determined in accordance
with this  _Section 2.2_ is greater than the Estimated Closing Net Assets,
then BGC Partners shall deliver such difference to the Partnership within five
(5) Business Days after the Determination Date by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by the
Partnership.

(g) Any payments made pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ or  _Section 2.2(f)_
shall be treated as an adjustment to the BP Purchase Price.

Section 2.3 _Special Asset Servicing Group Assets_. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that the Partnership is not intending to sell to BGC Partners, and
BGC Partners is not intending to purchase, the Special Asset Servicing Group
Assets held by Berkeley Point or its Subsidiaries, but that the Parties
expect that Berkeley Point or its Subsidiaries will continue to hold the
Special Asset Servicing Group Assets. Accordingly, the Parties agree that the
Partnership shall bear all of the benefits and burdens of the Special Asset
Servicing Group Assets after the Closing, even though legal title to the
Special Asset Servicing Group Assets may continue to be held by Berkeley Point
after the Closing, until the Special Asset Servicing Group Assets are
transferred from Berkeley Point to the Partnership (the " _Special Asset
Servicing Transfer Date_ "), it being understood that Berkeley Point and the
Partnership will transfer the employment of any employee that is part of the
Special Asset Servicing Group Assets as of such Special Asset Servicing
Transfer Date in a manner to avoid disruption to each Partys respective
business. The Special Asset Servicing Transfer Date shall occur at such date
and time as determined by the Partnership following receipt of any required
consents or approvals from the GSEs. After the Closing and until the Special
Asset Servicing Transfer Date, BGC Partners shall, and shall cause Berkeley
Point to, hold the Special Asset Servicing Group Assets in trust for the use
and benefit of the Partnership (at the expense of the Partnership), and shall
take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by the Partnership in
order to place the Partnership, insofar as reasonably possible, in the same
position it would be had the Special Asset Servicing Group Assets been
retained directly by the Partnership. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, BGC Partners shall not dispose of any of the Special Asset
Servicing Group Assets without the prior consent of the Partnership. After
the Closing and until the Special Asset Servicing Transfer Date, if BGC
Partners or any of its Subsidiaries receive any payment or other amount that
is, or is on account of the ownership and operation of, a Special
Asset Servicing Group Asset, BGC Partners shall promptly remit, or cause to
be remitted, such amount to the Partnership.

Section 2.4  _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, (a) each payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be made net
of any Taxes required by Applicable Law to be deducted or withheld from such
payment and (b) any amounts deducted or withheld from any such payment shall
be remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority and shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made.

Section 3.4 _Tax Treatment; Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(a) The Parties intend that, for U.S. federal (and applicable state and local)
income Tax purposes (the Tax treatment described in the following provisions,
the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "): (i) the BP Sale shall be treated as the
acquisition of all of the assets of Berkeley Point (other than the Special
Asset Servicing Group Assets, which shall be treated as having been retained
by the Partnership) by BGC Partners and/or its relevant Subsidiaries from the
Partnership in a taxable transaction; _provided_ that, if any portion of the
BP Purchase Price is satisfied in BGC Units pursuant to  _Section 2.1(a)_,
then the BP Sale shall, solely with respect to a pro rata portion of each such
asset of Berkeley Point deemed acquired in exchange for such BGC Units, be
treated as a contribution by the Partnership to BGC Holdings of such pro rata
portion of each such asset in exchange for such BGC Units in a transaction
described in Section 721 of the Code; and (ii) the BGC Investment and the

(b) The Partnership and BGC Partners agree to allocate and, as applicable, to
cause their relevant Affiliates to allocate, the BP Purchase Price (as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.2_) and any other items treated for
Tax purposes as additional consideration in the BP Sale among the assets of
Berkeley Point (other than the Special Asset Servicing Group Assets) in
accordance with the following provisions of this _Section 3.4(b)_. No later
than ninety (90) days after the date on which the BP Purchase Price is finally
determined pursuant to  _Section 2.2_, the Partnership shall deliver to BGC
Partners a proposed allocation of the BP Purchase Price (as finally determined
pursuant to _Section 2.2_) and any other items that are treated for Tax
purposes as additional consideration in the BP Sale as of the Closing Date
determined in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Partnership s
Allocation_"). If BGC Partners disagrees with Partnerships Allocation, BGC
Partners may, within twenty (20) days after delivery of Partnerships
Allocation, deliver a notice (the " _BGC Allocation Notice_ ") to the
Partnership to such effect, specifying those items as to which BGC Partners
disagrees and setting forth BGC Partners proposed allocation. If the BGC
Allocation Notice is duly delivered, the Partnership and BGC Partners shall,
during the twenty (20) days following such delivery, use commercially
reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in
order to determine the allocation of the BP Purchase Price (as finally
determined pursuant to _Section 2.2_) and any other items that are treated
as additional consideration for Tax purposes. If the Partnership and BGC
Partners are unable to reach such

 



-20-  agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause the Accounting Referee to
resolve any remaining disputes. The allocation, as prepared by the Partnership
if no BGC Allocation Notice has been given, as adjusted pursuant to any
agreement between the Partnership and BGC Partners or as determined by the
Accounting Referee (the " _Allocation_ ") shall be conclusive and binding on
the Parties hereto.

 

(c) None of the Parties shall (and each shall cause its Affiliates not to)
take any position (whether on any Tax Return, in connection with any Tax
proceeding or otherwise) that is inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment
or the Allocation, except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or
any similar provision of state or local Applicable Law).

transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets;

7.2_ if such action had been taken after the Agreement Date.

applicable to any claim for, or the period for the collection, assessment or
reassessment of, material Taxes due from the BP Group for any taxable period.
No request for any such waiver or extension is currently pending. The time
for filing any material Tax Return with respect to the BP Group has not been
extended to a date later than the Agreement Date.

 

(d) No audit or other Tax Contest is pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Partnership, threatened with respect to any material Taxes due from the BP
Group. No Governmental Authority has given notice of any intention to assert
any deficiency or claim for a material amount of additional Taxes against the
BP Group. No claim has been made by any Governmental Authority in a

franchise Tax Returns or pay an income or franchise Tax that it is or may be
required to file such Tax Returns or pay such Tax in such jurisdiction.

 

(e) There are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets or properties of the BP
Group, except for Permitted Liens.

the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b) (or any similar
provision of any Tax Applicable Law) or (ii) taken any reporting position on a
Tax Return, which reporting position if not sustained would be reasonably
likely to give rise to a material penalty for substantial understatement of
federal income Tax under Section 6662 of the Code (or any similar provision of
any Tax Applicable Law).

 

(g) No member of the BP Group or NewCo is a party to any Tax Sharing Agreement
or has any Liability for Taxes of any Person under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6, Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-78 or similar provision
of any Tax Applicable Law, or as a transferee or successor. No member of the

combined or unitary group for purposes of filing Tax Returns or paying Taxes.

 

(h) Each member of the BP Group has withheld from their respective employees,
contractors, creditors, equityholders and third parties and timely paid to
the appropriate Governmental Authority all material amounts required to be so
withheld for all periods ending on or before the Closing Date in material

under Applicable Law for filing the Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer
Taxes shall prepare and timely file such Tax Returns and promptly provide a
copy of such Tax Return to the other Party. The Partnership and BGC Partners
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate to timely
prepare and file any Tax Returns or other filings relating to such Transfer
Taxes, including any claim for exemption or exclusion from the application of
imposition of any Transfer Taxes.

(c) The Partnership shall be entitled to any refund or credit of
Taxes imposed on or with respect to (i) any member of the BP Group for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, except to the extent such refund or credit is
reflected as an asset in Adjusted Closing Net Assets as finally determined
hereunder and (ii) the Special Asset Servicing Assets or Liabilities or their
ownership or operations.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes of the BP Group
that are payable with respect to any Tax period that begins before and ends
after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of any such
Taxes that constitutes Pre-Closing Taxes shall (i) in the case of Taxes that
are either (A) based upon or related to income or receipts or (B) imposed in
connection with any sale, transfer or assignment or any deemed sale, transfer
or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), be
deemed equal to the amount that would be payable for such Straddle Period if
such Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date and (ii) in the case of Taxes
that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the business or assets
of the BP Group or otherwise measured by the level of any item (such as
property taxes and similar taxes), be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes
for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. For purposes of clause (i) of the
preceding sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or other item that is
calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date on a pro rata basis determined by
multiplying the total amount of such item for the Straddle Period by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. The Parties
will, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, elect with the relevant
Governmental Authority to treat a portion of any Straddle Period as a short
taxable period ending as of the close of business on the Closing Date. 

 



-39- (e) After the Closing, Cantor shall have the right to control the conduct,
through counsel of its own choosing, of any BP Tax Contest for any taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date (a " _Cantor Tax Contest_ ");
_provided_ , that, without the consent of the BGC Parties, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, Cantor shall not
settle, compromise or concede any portion of such Tax Contest that is
reasonably likely to result in a Tax Liability of Berkeley Point and its
Subsidiaries for any taxable year or portion thereof beginning after the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that if Cantor fails to assume control
of the conduct of any such Tax Contest within a reasonable period following
the receipt by Cantor of notice of such Tax Contest, the BGC Parties shall
have the right to assume control of such Tax Contest and shall be able to
settle, compromise or concede such Tax Contest in their reasonable discretion.
The BGC Parties shall control the conduct, through counsel of their own
choosing, of any BP Tax Contest other than any Cantor Tax Contest; _provided_
, that in the case of any such BP Tax Contest with respect to a Straddle
Period, (i) the BGC Parties shall provide Cantor with a timely and reasonably
detailed account of each stage of such Tax Contest, (ii) the BGC Parties
shall consult with Cantor and give Cantor a reasonable opportunity to comment
before taking any significant action or submitting any written materials in
connection with such Tax Contest; (iii) the BGC Parties shall defend such Tax
Contest diligently and in good faith as if they were the only parties in
interest in connection with such Tax Contest, (iv) Cantor shall have the right
to participate in such Tax Contest at its own expense, and (v) the BGC
Parties shall not settle, compromise or concede any portion of such Tax
Contest without the consent of Cantor, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. Cantor, the Partnership and the BGC Parties
shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, such information (including access to
books and records) and assistance relating to Berkeley Point and its
Subsidiaries (including the Special Asset Servicing Assets) and their
operation as is reasonably requested for the filing of any Tax Returns and the
preparation, prosecution, defense or conduct of any Tax Contest. Cantor, the
Partnership and the BGC Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with each other in the conduct of any Tax Contest or other
proceeding involving or otherwise relating to any Taxes of Berkeley Point and
its Subsidiaries or any Taxes relating to the Special Asset Servicing Assets
or Liabilities, or their ownership and operation, and each shall execute and
deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry
out the intent of this _Section 7.3_.

 

(f) Cantor shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all Tax
Returns of any member of the BP Group for a taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date (any such Tax Return, a " _Cantor Return_ "). Except
as otherwise required by Applicable Law, all Cantor Returns shall be prepared
in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement and, except to
the extent relating to the Special Asset Servicing Assets or Liabilities, or
their ownership or operation, past practice. To the extent it is necessary for
the BGC Parties to cause Berkeley Point or any of its Subsidiaries to file any
Tax Return prepared by Cantor pursuant to this _Section 7.3(f)_, the BGC
Parties shall cause Berkeley Point or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
to sign each such Tax Return in a manner sufficient for filing. The BGC
Parties shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all Tax
Returns of Berkeley Point and its Subsidiaries due following the Closing other
than any Cantor Returns. In the case of any Tax Return of Berkeley Point or
its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period (any such Tax Return, a " _Straddle
Return_ "), the BGC Parties shall prepare such Tax Return in a manner
consistent with past practice and the terms of this Agreement, in each case,
except as otherwise required by Applicable Law. The BGC Parties shall deliver
any such Straddle Returns to Cantor

 



-40-  at least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is
required to be filed. If Cantor disputes any item on any such Straddle Return,
it shall, within ten (10) days of receiving such Tax Return, notify the BGC
Parties of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for its objection. The
BGC Parties and Cantor shall negotiate in good faith for ten (10) days
following the BGC Parties receipt of such notice to resolve any such
disputed items. If the BGC Parties and Cantor are unable to resolve any
disputed item during such ten (10)-day period, then any remaining disputed
items, and only such remaining disputed items, shall be resolved by
the Accounting Referee. The Accounting Referee shall be instructed to resolve
any such remaining disputes in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
within ten (10) days after its appointment. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Referee attributable to such dispute shall be borne equally by
Cantor, on the one hand, and the BGC Parties, on the other hand. The BGC
Parties shall notify Cantor or any amounts for which Cantor is responsible
under _Section 9.2(a)_ in respect of any Straddle Return no later than ten
(10) Business Days prior to the date on which such Straddle Return is due, and
Cantor shall remit such payment to the BGC Parties no later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the date such Straddle Return is due.

(g) After the Closing, in furtherance of the agreements relating to the
Special Asset Servicing Group Assets set forth in  _Section 2.3_ and
_Section 3.2(a)_, the Partnership and the BGC Parties shall cooperate to
report for Tax purposes any relevant items (including items of income, gain,
loss, deduction, credit or Tax) in respect of the Special Asset Servicing
Group Assets or Liabilities, or their ownership or operation, for any Post-
Closing Tax Period as items of the Partnership, and the Partnership shall
control the preparation of any Tax Return and the conduct of any Tax Contest
with respect thereto.

(h) To the extent of any inconsistency between this _Section 7.3_ and
_Article IX_ , this  _Section 7.3_ shall control as to Tax matters.

Section 7.4 _Intercompany Agreements_. All Contracts between Berkeley Point
and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries (excluding, for this purpose, Berkeley Point and its
Subsidiaries), on the other hand, shall automatically terminate at the Closing
without further action of the parties thereto, except for the Contracts
listed on _Section 7.4_ of the Disclosure Schedule and except for the
arrangements set forth on _Exhibit C_ , which arrangements the Parties agree
will take effect from and after the Closing without any further action on
behalf of any Party.

Section 7.5 _Data_. The Partnership and the BGC Parties agree to comply
with the obligations set forth in _Section 7.5_ of the Disclosure Schedule.

-42- Section 9.2 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Article IX_ , from and after the
Closing Date, Cantor shall indemnify and hold harmless the members of the BGC
Partners Group and each of their respective heirs, executors, successors and
assigns (collectively, the " _BGC Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against any
Losses that any BGC Indemnified Person incurs to the extent resulting from or
arising out of:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Cantor set forth in
_Article VI_ as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing

Section 9.3 _Notification_. Any Indemnified Person entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement may seek indemnification for any Loss by giving written
notice to Cantor or BGC Partners, as applicable (the " _Indemnifying Person_
"), specifying (a) the basis for such indemnification claim and (b) if known,
the aggregate amount of Loss for which a claim is being made under this
_Article IX_. Written notice to such Indemnifying Person of the event giving
rise to such claim shall be given by the Indemnified Person as soon as
practicable after the Indemnified Person first receives notice of
the potential claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure to provide
such written notice of the event giving rise to such claim shall not affect
the Indemnified Persons right to indemnification or relieve the Indemnifying
Person of its obligations under this _Article IX_ except to the extent that
such failure results in a lack of actual notice to the Indemnifying Person of
the event giving rise to such claim and the Indemnifying Person has been
materially prejudiced as a result of such delay.

Section 9.4 _Third-Party Claims_.

 

(a) If a claim by a third party is made against an Indemnified Person, and if
such Indemnified Person intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto under
this _Article IX_ , such Indemnified Person shall promptly (and in any event
not more than thirty (30) days after receiving such actual notice of such
claim) give written notice to the Indemnifying Person of such claim (a "
_Third-Party Claim_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure to provide
such written notice of such Third-Party Claim shall not affect the Indemnified
Persons right to indemnification or relieve the Indemnifying Person of its
obligations under this _Article IX_ except to the extent that such failure
results in a lack of actual notice to the Indemnifying Person of the event
giving rise to such claim and the Indemnifying Person has been
materially prejudiced as a result of such delay. Any such notice shall
describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail, including, if known, the
amount of the Loss or a good faith estimate thereof.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Person may elect (but is not required) to assume the
defense of and defend such Third-Party Claim solely at its own expense;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Indemnity Period has not expired at the
time of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person may exercise its
rights pursuant to this sentence only if the Indemnifying Person acknowledges
in writing to the Indemnified Person that such Third-Party Claim is
indemnifiable under this Agreement or another Transaction Document. Within
thirty (30) days after the receipt of notice from an Indemnified Person in
accordance with  _Section 9.4(a)_, the Indemnifying Person shall notify the
Indemnified Person, as applicable, of its election whether it will assume
responsibility for defending such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying
Person elects to assume the defense of any such Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Person may participate in such defense, but, as long as the
Indemnifying Person pursues such defense with reasonable diligence, the
expenses of the Indemnified Person incurred in participating in such defense
shall be paid by the Indemnified Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Indemnified Person in good faith determines, upon the advice of counsel, that
the Indemnified Person may have available to it one or more defenses or
counterclaims that are inconsistent with one or more of those that may be
available to the Indemnifying Person in respect of such Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall bear the cost of one firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Persons (in addition to local counsel).

 



-45- (c) The Indemnifying Person shall have the right to compromise or settle a
Third-Party Claim the defense of which it shall have assumed pursuant to this
_Section 9.4_, and any such settlement or compromise made or caused to be
made of a Third-Party Claim in accordance with this _Article IX_ shall be
binding on the Indemnified Person in the same manner as if a final judgment
or decree had been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction in the amount
of such settlement or compromise. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the
Indemnifying Person shall not have the right to admit liability on behalf of
the Indemnified Person and shall not compromise or settle a Third-Party Claim
in each case without the express prior consent of the Indemnified Person (not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); _provided_ that such prior consent
shall not be required in the case of any such compromise or settlement if and
only if the compromise or settlement does not involve any finding or admission
of any violation of law by an Indemnified Person, includes, as a
part thereof, a full and unconditional release by the plaintiff or claimant
of all Indemnified Persons from all liability with respect to such Third-Party
Claim and does not require any Indemnified Person to make any payment that is
not fully indemnified under this Agreement or to be subject to any non-
monetary remedy. The Indemnified Person shall not pay or settle any claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Person (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnified Person shall have the right to pay or settle any such claim;
_provided_ that, in such event, it shall waive any right to indemnity therefor
by any Indemnifying Person.

shall be responsible only for such Losses of the Seller Indemnified Persons
in excess of the Deductible Amount; _provided_ that no indemnification shall
be made by BGC Partners with respect to any claim made pursuant to _Section
9.2(b)(i)_ to the extent that the aggregate amount of Losses of the Seller
Indemnified Persons indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ (taking into
account for these purposes any Losses excluded as a result of the Deductible
Amount or _Section 9.5(b)(ii)_) is in excess of an amount equal to (A) $97.5
million (it being agreed that the Seller Indemnified Persons shall bear the
first $9.75 million of such Losses), _minus_ (B) the amount of indemnification
payments that have been made pursuant to  _Section 9.2(b)_ prior to the time
of such claim.

less than $50,000.

(iii) BGC Partners shall be obligated to indemnify any Seller Indemnified
Person pursuant to  _Section 9.2(b)_ only for those claims giving rise to
any Loss as to which such Seller Indemnified Person has given BGC Partners
written notice prior to the end of the applicable Indemnity Period.

 

Section 9.6 _Third-Party Reimbursement_. The amount of Losses of any
Indemnified Person under this _Article IX_ shall be reduced by the amount, if
any, (a) received by the Indemnified Person from any third Person (including
any insurance company or other insurance provider, net of any expenses
actually incurred in connection with such receipt) in respect of such Losses
(" _Third-Party Reimbursement_ ") and (b) of any net Tax benefits realized by
the Indemnified Person through an actual reduction in Taxes otherwise due as a
result of such Losses incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Person. If,
after receipt by an Indemnified

 



-47-  Person of an indemnification payment hereunder, such Person receives any
Third-Party Reimbursement in respect of the Losses (whether in whole or in
part) for which an indemnification payment was made hereunder, then the
Indemnified Person shall promptly turn over all or the relevant portion of
such Third-Party Reimbursement to the Indemnifying Person up to the amount of
such indemnification payment.

 

Section 9.7 _Exclusive Remedies_. Notwithstanding any other provision
contained in this Agreement, except in the case of a fraud or willful
misconduct on the part of a Party hereto and except as specifically set forth
in this _Article IX_ or _Section 10.13_, there shall be no rights, claims or

connection with this Agreement or the Transactions, other than any such Losses
awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction in connection with a Third-Party
Claim.

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 

Section 10.1 _Expenses_. The Parties shall each pay all of their own fees,
costs and expenses (including attorneys and accountants fees, costs and

Transactions.

 

Section 10.2 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by each of the Partnership, Cantor and BGC
Partners.

Section 10.3 _Confidentiality; Publicity_.

 

(a) The Parties will not, and will direct their respective representatives not
to, disclose to any Person, any confidential or proprietary information
obtained pursuant to the negotiations of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) each of the Parties
may disclose this Agreement and the terms contained herein (A) to
its representatives that have a _bona fide_ need to know such information;
(B) as otherwise required by Applicable Law, subject to _Section 10.3(b)_;
(C) to enforce this Agreement; and (D) to its Affiliates; and (y) the
Partnership may disclose this Agreement and the terms contained herein to the
limited partners of the Partnership.

 



-48- (b) In the event that a Party is requested or required (by oral questions,
interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any information described
in _Section 10.3(a)_, it is agreed that such Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the other Parties with prompt notice of such
request(s) (to the extent not prohibited by law), so that the other Parties
and/or their respective Affiliates may seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy. If such protective order or other remedy is not obtained
and a Party is compelled to disclose information described in _Section
10.3(a)_, or if compliance with _Section 10.3(a)_ is waived, such Party or
its representatives, as applicable, shall furnish only that portion of such
information which it reasonably believes to be legally required.

(c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Parties may issue a press
release to publicly announce the transactions contemplated in this Agreement;
_provided_ that the content of such release shall be subject to the approval
of the Partnership, Cantor and BGC Partners, such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 10.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement contains all of the
terms, conditions and representations and warranties agreed to by the Parties
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior and
contemporaneous agreements, negotiations, correspondence, undertakings and
communications of the Parties or their representatives, oral or written,
respecting such subject matter.

Section 10.5 _Further Assurances_. From and after the Agreement Date, each of
the Parties shall execute such documents and perform such further acts as may
be reasonably required to carry out the applicable provisions hereof and the
consummation of the Transactions.

 

Section 10.6 _Notices_. Any notice or other communication required or
permitted under this Agreement shall be deemed to have been duly given and
made if (a) in writing and served by personal delivery upon the Party for whom
it is intended; (b) delivered by facsimile upon the date on which such
facsimile is received, _provided_ that such notice or communication is also
sent on the same day by overnight certified mail, registered mail or courier
service; or (c) delivered by overnight certified mail, registered mail or
courier service, upon the earlier of (i) return-receipt received to the Party
at the address set forth below, to the Persons indicated or (ii) one (1)

Section 10.8 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any Party
without the prior written consent of the Partnership, Cantor and BGC Partners,

-50- Section 10.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process_. Any action

in any state or federal court located in the State of Delaware, and each of
the Parties hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts in any such action and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such action in any such court or that any such
action brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Process in any such Action may be served on any Party anywhere in the world,
whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without
limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of process on such
Party as provided in _Section 10.6_ shall be deemed effective service of
process on such Party.

 

Section 10.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST

THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).

 

Section 10.13 _Specific Performance_. Each Party hereby agrees that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed by them in accordance with the terms hereof
or were otherwise breached and that each other Party shall be entitled,

injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions hereof and to
specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at
law or equity.

 

Section 10.14 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Transactions are not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a reasonably
acceptable manner so that the Transactions may be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 10.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts with the same effect as if the signatures to each counterpart
were upon a single instrument, and all such counterparts together shall be
deemed an original of this Agreement. This Agreement may be executed via
facsimile or other electronic means and shall be deemed to have the same legal
effect as delivery of an original signed copy of this Agreement.
