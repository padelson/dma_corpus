six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance covering acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time with respect to those Persons who are currently covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy on terms with respect to such
coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that Parent may substitute therefor policies of
Parent containing terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable to such directors and officers; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>further provided</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that in satisfying its
