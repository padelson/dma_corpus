 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously determined that the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger") and this Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and the holders of the common stock of the Company, par value $.01 per share (the "Company Common Stock"); and

 WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER 

  

    Section 1.1 _ The Merger. _ Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a
result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation following

 Section 1.2 _ Effective Time; Closing. _ As promptly as practicable (and in any event within three Business Days) after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII _hereof (other  than conditions to be satisfied at the Closing but subject to satisfaction
of such conditions), the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate of Merger")
with the Secretary of State of Delaware and by making all other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger, in such
form as is required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of, the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time
as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of
Delaware, or at such later time as the parties hereto shall agree and shall be
specified in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes
effective, the "Effective Time"). On the date of such filing (the
"Closing Date"), a closing (the "Closing") shall be held at 9:00 a.m., New
York Time, at the offices of Clifford Chance US LLP, 200 Park Avenue, New
York, New York 10166, or at such other time and location as the parties hereto
shall otherwise agree.

  

    
 Section 1.3 _ Effect of the Merger. _ At the Effective Time, the effects of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL and this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

    
 Section 1.4 _ Conversion of Company Common Stock. _ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof: 

  

  

 (a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)_, if any, shall automatically be canceled and shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted automatically into the right to receive 0.37 of a fully paid and nonassessable share (the "Exchange Ratio") of Parent Common Stock upon surrender of the certificate that formerly evidenced such share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in _Section 2.2_, without interest. All references to shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to include the rights attached thereto pursuant to the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement dated as of September 11, 2001, between the Company and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company as Rights Agent, as amended as of February 19, 2003 (the "Company Rights Agreement"), unless the context indicates otherwise. The consideration to be issued to holders of Company Common Stock is referred to herein as the "Merger Consideration." 

  

 (b) Each share of Company Common Stock (i) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Parent or Merger Sub or (ii) that is owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be automatically canceled and retired and cease to exist, and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. 

  

 (c) All shares of the Company Common Stock cancelled and converted pursuant to _Section 1.4(a) _shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate ("Certificate") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock shall from and after the Effective Time cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 1.4(a)_. 

   

 (d) The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted (i) to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities exchangeable for or convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time and (ii) in the event of a breach of _Sections 4.2, 5.2, 6.1(c)_ or _6.2(c)_ of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time, to reflect fully the effect of any differences attributable to such breach between the number of fully diluted 

  

    
  

 shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock outstanding compared
to the numbers set forth in _Sections 4.2_ or _5.2_ , respectively, so that
50% of the fully diluted shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding
immediately following the Effective Time will be held by those who,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, held shares of Parent Common Stock or
options, rights or convertible securities exercisable for or convertible into
shares of Parent Common Stock, and the other 50% of the fully diluted shares
of Parent Common Stock outstanding immediately following the Effective Time
will be held by those who, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
held shares of Company Common Stock or options, rights or convertible
securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of Company Common Stock.
For purposes of this _Section 1.4(d)_, "fully diluted" shall be computed
using the "Treasury Stock Method" under generally accepted accounting
principles and assuming a trading price equal to the trading price on the
date hereof.

  

  

    
 Section 1.5 _ Conversion of Common Stock of Merger Sub. _ Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

    
 Section 1.6 _ Tax-Free Reorganization. _ The Merger is intended to be a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and this Agreement is intended to be a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of the regulations promulgated under Section 368(a) of the Code and for the purpose of qualifying as a tax-free transaction for federal income tax purposes. The parties hereto agree to report the Merger as a tax-free reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a). None of the parties hereto will take or cause to be taken any action which would prevent the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a). 

  

    
ARTICLE II 

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 

  

    Section 2.1 _ Exchange Agent. _ Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company reasonably
satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent hereunder for the
purpose of exchanging Certificates for the Merger Consideration (the "Exchange
Agent"). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of the Company
Common Stock, certificates representing the Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to _Section 1.4. _Parent shall also deposit with the Exchange
Agent from time to time, as needed, amounts sufficient to pay cash in lieu of
fractional shares in accordance with _Section 2.5 _and any dividends and
other distributions required to be paid upon the surrender of Certificates
pursuant to _Section 2.3_.

  

    
 Section 2.2 _ Exchange Procedures. _ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within five Business Days), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a certificate representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.4 _and (B) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of applicable Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.5_, and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.3 _(after giving effect to any required tax withholdings from cash payments), and in each case the Certificate so surrendered 

    shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any
cash payable pursuant to _Section 2.3 _or _Section 2.5_.

  

    
 Section 2.3 _ Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. _ No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section 2.5 _until such holder shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.2_. Subject to the effect of any applicable United States federal, state or local or any applicable foreign statute, law, rule, regulation, ordinance, code, order, judgment, decree or any other applicable requirement or rule of law (a "Law"), following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (a) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.5 _and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date and payment date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender which would have been paid if the whole shares of Parent Common Stock had been issued as of such record date and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

 Section 2.5 _ No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock. _ 

  

  

 (a) No certificates or scrip or shares of Parent Common Stock representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any such fractional shares and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock.

The fractional share interests of Parent Common Stock will be aggregated with respect to all Certificates tendered by each holder of Company Common Stock, and no holder of record of Company Common Stock will receive cash in an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Parent Common Stock. 

  

  

    
 Section 2.6 _ No Liability. _ If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to one year after the Effective Time, any such Merger Consideration or dividends or distributions in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with the provisions of this _Article II _

respect thereto, in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate
shall not have been surrendered prior to six years after the Effective Time
(or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration,
any dividends or distributions payable to the holder of such Certificate or
any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant
to this _Article II_, would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration or dividends or
distributions in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

    
 Section 2.7 _ Lost Certificates. _ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

    
 Section 2.8 _ Withholding Rights. _ Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation.

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is required to include in income any adjustment pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code by reason of a change in accounting method. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to any tax sharing agreement, other than tax sharing agreements among the Company and/or its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any agreement that could obligate it to make any payment that would be a nondeductible expense under Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been the "distributing corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(c)(2) of the Code) with respect to a transaction described in Section 355 of the Code within the 3-year period ending as of the date of this Agreement.

a transferee or successor, (C) by contract or (D) otherwise. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take any action or
knows of any fact or circumstance that may prevent the Merger from qualifying
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. For
purposes of this Agreement, (a) "Tax" (and, with correlative meaning,

property, sales, use, license, excise, franchise, employment, payroll,
premium, withholding, alternative or added minimum, ad valorem, transfer or

 Section and/or subsections), Parent and Merger Sub hereby jointly and
severally represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

Parent owns beneficially and of record all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each Subsidiary of Parent listed in _Section 5.2 of the Parent Disclosure Letter _and does not own an equity interest in any other corporation, partnership or entity, other than in such Subsidiaries. Each outstanding share of capital stock of each Subsidiary of Parent is 

    duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and each such
share owned by Parent or another Subsidiary of Parent is free and clear of all
security interests, liens, claims, pledges, options, rights of first refusal,
agreements, limitations on Parent\'s or such other Subsidiary\'s voting
rights, charges and other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever. Neither
Parent nor its Subsidiaries have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or
other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or, except as
set forth in this _Section 5.2_, convertible into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of Parent on any
matter. To the Knowledge of Parent, other than the Voting Agreement, there
are no irrevocable proxies and no voting agreements with respect to any shares
of capital stock or other voting securities of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 Section 5.7 _ SEC Filings, Financial Statements. _ 

  

  

 (a) Parent has filed all forms, reports, statements and documents required to be filed with the SEC since January 1, 2000 (collectively, the "Parent SEC Reports"), each of which has complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to the Parent SEC Reports, each as in effect on the date so filed. None of the Parent SEC Reports (including, but not limited to, any financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference therein) contained when filed any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or 

  

    

 necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  

 (b) All of the financial statements included in the Parent SEC Reports, in each case, including any related notes thereto, as filed with the SEC (collectively, the "Parent Financial Statements"), have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal, recurring audit adjustments that will not be material in amount or effect) and fairly present the consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries at the respective date thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and changes in cash flows for the periods indicated. 

  

 (c) There are no liabilities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever, whether or not accrued and whether or not contingent or absolute, other than (i) liabilities disclosed in Parent\'s consolidated balance sheet as of February 2, 2002 (the "Parent February 2002 Balance Sheet") included in Parent\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2002 (the "Parent 10-K"), (ii) liabilities incurred on behalf of Parent in connection with this Agreement and the contemplated Merger and (iii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since February 2, 2002, none of which are, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (d) Parent has provided the Company true and complete copies of all management letters received from its independent auditors since January 1, 2000, and if no such management letters have been received, Parent has provided copies of all correspondence from its independent auditors during such period relating to subject matter of the same type as would be included in a management letter. 

  

  

    
 Section 5.8 _ Absence of Certain Changes or Events. _ Except as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, since February 2, 2002, Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in the ordinary course and consistent with prior practice and there has not been (i) any events or occurrence of any conditions that have had or would reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or any other distribution with respect to any of the capital stock of Parent or any Subsidiary, (iii) any material change in accounting methods, principles or practices employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (iv) any action of the type described in _Section 6.2_ which had such action been taken after the date of this Agreement would be in violation of any such Section. 

  

    
 Section 5.9 _ Taxes. _ Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed all material Tax Returns required to be filed by any of them. All such Tax Returns are correct and complete in all material respects. All Taxes of Parent and its Subsidiaries which are (i) shown as due on such Tax Returns, (ii) otherwise due and payable or (iii) claimed or asserted by any taxing authority to be due, have been paid, except for those Taxes being contested in good faith and for which adequate reserves have been established in the financial statements included in the Parent SEC Reports in accordance with GAAP. There are no liens for any Taxes upon the assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, other than statutory liens for Taxes not yet due and payable and liens for real estate Taxes contested in good faith. Parent does not know of any proposed or threatened Tax claims or assessments which, individually or in the aggregate, exceed $250,000. Parent and each Subsidiary has disclosed on its Tax Returns all positions taken therein that would give rise to a substantial understatement of Tax within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code and any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law.

    paid in connection with payments to employees, officers, directors,
independent contractors, creditors, stockholders or other third parties,
except for such Taxes which individually or in the aggregate are not
reasonably expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The unpaid
Taxes of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the current taxable period did not,
as of the most recent Parent Financial Statement, exceed the reserve for Tax
liability (disregarding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the
balance sheet in the most recent Parent Financial Statement. Neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries is required to include in income any adjustment
pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code by reason of a change in accounting
method. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to
any tax sharing agreement, other than tax sharing agreements among
Parent and/or its Subsidiaries. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has entered into any agreement that could obligate it to make any payment that
would be a nondeductible expense under Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the
Code. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has been the "distributing
corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355 (c)(2) of the Code) with
respect to a transaction described in Section 355 of the Code within the
3-year period ending as of the date of this Agreement. Neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has a permanent establishment in any foreign country as
defined in any applicable Tax treaty or convention between the United States
and that foreign country. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries owns an
interest in a "passive foreign investment company," as defined in Section 1297
of the Code or a "controlled foreign corporation" as defined in Section 957 of
the Code. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has been a member of
an affiliated group, as defined in Section 1504(a) of the Code (other than a
group the common parent of which was Parent); and (ii) has liability for the
Taxes of any Person, other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, under (A)
Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury regulations (or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign Law), (B) as a transferee or successor, (C) by
contract, or (D) otherwise. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has taken or agreed to take any action or knows of any fact or circumstance
that may prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

    
 Section 5.10 _ Title to Assets. _ Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have good and marketable title to, or a valid leasehold or subleasehold interest in, all of their real and personal properties and assets reflected in the Parent February 2002 Balance Sheet or acquired after February 2, 2002 (other than assets disposed of since February 2, 2002 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice), in each case free and clear of all mortgages, title defects, liens, pledges, encumbrances and restrictions, except for (i) liens for Taxes accrued but not yet payable; (ii) liens arising as a matter of Law in the ordinary course of business with respect to obligations incurred after February 2, 2002, _provided_ that the obligations secured by such liens are not delinquent; and (iii) such title defects, liens, encumbrances and restrictions, if any, as, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. _Section 5.10 of the Parent Disclosure Letter _sets forth a correct and complete list of all real property owned or leased by Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries either own, or have valid leasehold interests in, all properties and assets used by them in the conduct of their business. 

  

    
 Section 5.11 _ Litigation. _ There is (i) no Litigation pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) no judgment, order, injunction, decree, stipulation or award (whether rendered by a court, administrative agency, or by arbitration, pursuant to a grievance or other procedure) against or relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which, in the case of either (i) or (ii) above, if adversely determined, would reasonably be expected to result in, a loss to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in excess of $25,000. 

  

    
 Section 5.12 _ Employee Benefit Plans and Agreements. _ 

  

  

 (a) _Section 5.12 of the Parent Disclosure Letter _lists all deferred compensation, pension, profit-sharing and retirement plans, and all bonus, welfare, severance policies and programs and other "employee benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), fringe benefit or stock option, 

  

    

 stock ownership, stock appreciation, phantom stock or equity (or equity-
based) plans, including individual contracts, severance agreements, employee
agreements, consulting agreements with individuals which either involve
payment of in excess of $50,000 per year or are not terminable by Parent on 30
days\' notice or less without the payment of amounts in consideration of
termination, separation and change in control programs, agreements or
arrangements, or employee retention agreements, providing the same or similar
benefits, whether or not written, participated in or maintained by Parent or
with respect to which contributions are made or obligations assumed by Parent
in respect of Parent (including health, life insurance and other benefit plans
maintained for former employees or retirees). Such plans or other
arrangements are collectively referred to herein as "Parent Benefit Plans."
Copies of all Parent Benefit Plans and related documents, including those
setting out Parent\'s personnel policies and procedures, and including any
insurance contracts, trust agreements or other arrangements under which
benefits are provided, as currently in effect, and descriptions of any such
plan which are not written have been made available for inspection by the
Company. Parent has also made available for inspection by the Company a copy
of the summary plan description, if any, for each Parent Benefit Plan, as well
as copies of any other summaries or descriptions of any such Parent Benefit
Plans which have been provided to employees or other beneficiaries since
January 1, 2000.

  

 (b) Each Parent Benefit Plan is in compliance with, and has been administered in all material respects consistent with, the presently applicable material provisions of ERISA, the Code and state law, including but not limited to the satisfaction of all applicable reporting and disclosure requirements under the Code, ERISA and state law. Parent has made all payments to, or in respect of, all Parent Benefit Plans as required by the terms of each such plan. Parent has filed or caused to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service annual reports on Form 5500 for each Parent Benefit Plan attributable to them for all years and periods for which such reports were required and within the time period required by ERISA and the Code, and copies of such reports filed since January 1, 2000 have been made available for inspection by the Company. 

  

 (c) No "prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, has occurred in respect of any such Parent Benefit Plan, and no civil or criminal action brought pursuant to Part 5 of Title I or ERISA is pending or is threatened in writing or orally against any fiduciary of any such plan. 

  

 (d) The Internal Revenue Service has issued a letter for each employee pension benefit plan, as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, listed in _Section 5.12 of the Parent Disclosure Letter_, determining that such plan is a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code and is exempt from United States federal income tax under Section 501(a) of the Code, and Parent has no knowledge of any occurrence since the date of any such determination letter which has adversely affected such qualification. Parent does not maintain a plan or arrangement intended to qualify under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. 

  

 (e) Neither Parent nor any entity that is treated as a single employer with Parent pursuant to Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code ("Parent ERISA Affiliate") currently maintains, contributes to or has any liability with respect to any employee benefit plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, nor has previously maintained or contributed to any such plan that has resulted in any liability or potential liability for Parent under said Title IV. 

  

 (f) Parent does not maintain any Parent Benefit Plan that provides post-retirement medical benefits (other than benefits which are required by Law), post-employment benefits, death benefits or other post-retirement welfare benefits. With respect to any "welfare benefit plan" of Parent (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) that is self-insured, the aggregate amount of all claims made pursuant to any such plan that have not yet been paid is set forth in _Section 5.12 of the Parent Disclosure Letter_, together with each individual claim which could result in an uninsured liability in excess of $100,000 per participant or covered dependent. 

  

     

  

 (g) Neither Parent nor any Parent ERISA Affiliate maintains, nor has contributed since January 1, 2000 to, any multiemployer plan within the meaning of Sections 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA. No such employer currently has any liability to make withdrawal liability payments to any multiemployer plan. There is no pending dispute between any such employer and any multiemployer plan concerning payment of contributions or payment of withdrawal liability payments. 

  

 (h) All Parent Benefit Plans have been operated and administered in accordance with their respective terms and no inconsistent representation or interpretation has been made to any plan participant. 

  

 (i) On and after the Closing, no Parent Benefit Plan maintained by Parent shall cover or otherwise benefit any individuals other than current or former employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (and their dependents and beneficiaries). 

   

 (j) Each Parent Benefit Plan may be amended and terminated in accordance with its terms, and, each such plan provides for the unrestricted right of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent (as applicable) to amend or terminate such Plan. 

  

 (k) The Company and, including on and after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and any Subsidiary, shall have no material liability for, under, with respect to or otherwise in connection with any employee benefit plan, which liability arises under ERISA or the Code, by virtue of Parent or any Subsidiary being aggregated, with any other person that is a Parent ERISA Affiliate, in a controlled group or affiliated service group for purposes of ERISA or the Code at any relevant time prior to the Closing. Neither Parent nor any Parent ERISA Affiliate has any outstanding agreement or commitment, whether in writing or otherwise, to increase or improve the compensation, benefits or terms and conditions of employment or service of any director, officer, employee or consultant which would violate the terms of the covenant set forth in _Section 6.2(n)_ hereof. 

  

 (l) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event, such as termination of employment) (i) result in any material payment (including, without limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute or otherwise) becoming due to any director or any employee of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates from Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates under any Parent Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Parent Benefit Plan or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any material benefits. No individual who is a party to an employment agreement listed in _Section 5.12 of the Parent Disclosure Letter_ or any change-of-control employment agreement with Parent has terminated employment or been terminated, nor has any event occurred that could give rise to a termination event, in either case under circumstances that has given, or could give, rise to a severance obligation on the part of Parent under such agreement. 

  

  

    
 Section 5.13 _ Labor and Employment Matters. _ 

  

  

 (a) There are no agreements or arrangements on behalf of any officer, director or employee providing for payment or other benefits to such person relating to a change of control of Parent, severance payments or retention bonuses. 

  

 (b) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement or other contracts, arrangements, agreements or understandings with a labor union or labor organization that was certified by the NLRB. There is no existing, pending or threatened (i) unfair labor practice charge or complaint, labor dispute, labor arbitration proceeding or any other matter before the NLRB or any other comparable state agency against or involving 

  

    
  

 Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) activity or proceeding by a labor
union or representative thereof to organize any employees of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, (iii) certification or decertification question relating to
collective bargaining units at the premises of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or (iv) lockout, strike, organized slowdown, work stoppage or

 (h) All required or appropriate certificates of occupancy, permits, licenses, franchises, approvals and authorizations (collectively, the "Parent Real Property Permits") of all Governmental Entities having jurisdiction over the Parent Real Property, the absence of which would be reasonably likely to cause a Parent store to cease its operations, have been issued to Parent to enable the Parent Real Property to be lawfully occupied and used for all of the purposes for which it is currently occupied and used, have been lawfully issued and are, as of the date hereof, in full force and effect. Parent has not received, or been informed by a third party of the receipt by it of, any notice that would be reasonably likely to cause a Parent store to cease its operations from any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Parent Real Property threatening a suspension, revocation, modification or cancellation of any Parent Real Property Permit or requiring any remediation in connection with maintaining any Parent Real Property Permit, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, there is no basis for the issuance of any such notice or the taking of any such action.

Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall approve or recommend,

For purposes of this Agreement, a "Parent Superior Proposal" means any written bona fide proposal made by a third party and not solicited by Parent relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 50% or more of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 50% or more of the combined voting power of the shares of Parent Common Stock, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 50% or more of the combined voting power of the shares of Parent Common Stock or any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which the other party thereto or its stockholders will own 50% or more of the combined voting power of the parent entity resulting from any such transaction, and otherwise on terms which the Board of Directors of Parent determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and considering any modifications to this Agreement proposed by the Company), taking into account legal, financial, 

  

    
  

 regulatory and other aspects of the proposal deemed appropriate by the Board
of Directors of Parent, (i) to be more favorable from a financial point of
view than the Merger (taking into account any amendments to the Merger
proposed by the Company in response to the receipt by Parent of the proposal)
to Parent\'s stockholders taken as a whole, (ii) is capable of being
completed reasonably promptly and (iii) for which financing, to the extent
required, is then committed or is reasonably capable of being obtained by such
third party.

  

 (c) Neither the Board of Directors of Parent nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the Company, the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or such committee of the Merger or this Agreement or fail to reaffirm such approval or recommendation within a reasonable amount of time after the Company requests such an affirmation, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Parent Acquisition Proposal or Parent Superior Proposal or (iii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to any Parent Acquisition Proposal or Parent Superior Proposal (each, a "Parent Acquisition Agreement") or propose publicly or agree to do any of the foregoing other than pursuant to the next sentence in order to facilitate such action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the Parent Applicable Period, in response to a Parent Superior Proposal which did not result from a breach of _Section 7.5(a)_, and provided that Parent is not in breach of this _Section 7.5_, if the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith (and after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of national reputation), that it is required in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to Parent\'s stockholders under applicable law to take any action specified in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence, it may take such action specified in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence; _provided_ that simultaneously with taking such action it also terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(h)_ hereof and executes a definitive Parent Acquisition Agreement to implement the Parent Superior Proposal, but only at a time that is during the Parent Applicable Period and is after the fifth Business Day following the Company\'s receipt of notice advising the Company that the Board of Directors of Parent is prepared to accept such Parent Superior Proposal, specifying the terms and conditions of such Parent Superior Proposal (including a copy of any relevant Parent Acquisition Agreement). No such termination shall be effective unless and until the Company shall have received the Parent Termination Fee. 

  

 (d) In addition to the obligations of Parent set forth in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this _Section 7.5_, Parent shall promptly (and no more than 24 hours after receipt) advise the Company of the receipt of any Parent Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry which would reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, including the material terms and conditions of such request and the identity of the Person requesting such information or making such Parent Acquisition Proposal, and will keep the Company reasonably and promptly informed of the status of any such request or proposal and the substance of any discussions relating to such Parent Acquisition Proposal, including providing any information the Company may reasonably request. Parent will promptly provide the Company with a copy of any written materials (including emails) received from or on behalf of any third party with respect to or which could lead to any Parent Acquisition Proposal and of any materials provided to such third party (including any information regarding Parent or its Subsidiaries not previously furnished to the Company). 

   

 (e) Parent shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives, to cease immediately any existing discussions regarding a Parent Acquisition Proposal, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (f) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.5_ shall prohibit Parent from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange 

  

    
  

 Act or from making any disclosure to Parent\'s stockholders if, in the good
faith judgment of Parent\'s Board of Directors failure so to disclose would be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that subject to _Section 7.5(c)_, neither Parent nor its Board
of Directors nor any committee thereof shall approve or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, a Parent Acquisition Proposal or Parent
Superior Proposal or withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or
modify, in a manner adverse to the Company, the approval or recommendation by
such Board of Directors or such committee of the Merger or this Agreement
except as otherwise contemplated by this _Section 7.5_.

  

  

    
 Section 7.6 _ Company Options, Restricted Stock, Company Plans and Severance Agreements. _ 

  

  

 (a) Parent agrees that all Company Benefit Plans (including the employment agreements, severance agreements, termination agreements and confidentiality and stay agreements (collectively, the "Company Agreements") referenced therein) shall remain in full force and effect after the Effective Time, except to the extent modified pursuant to this _Section 7.6_, and Parent agrees to take all actions necessary to fully assume and adopt, or to cause the Company or a Subsidiary thereof to perform (and, as necessary in connection therewith, to assume and adopt), each such Company Benefit Plan and Company Agreement in its entirety and to perform the obligations of the Company thereunder outstanding as of the Effective Time in accordance with its terms; _provided_ , _however_ , the foregoing shall not require Parent (or, as applicable, the Company or a Subsidiary) to continue any such Company Benefit Plan or Company Agreement; and, _provided_ _further_ , that it is expressly acknowledged and agreed that nothing in this sentence shall permit Parent (or, as applicable, the Company or a Subsidiary) to effect any amendment or termination of any such Company Benefit Plan or Company Agreement which amendment or termination reduces any accrued benefits in a manner that is not permitted by law or that is not permitted by such Company Benefit Plan or Company Agreement as in effect from time to time. 

  

 (b) The parties acknowledge that, unless otherwise provided in such plan, program or arrangement, as of the Effective Time or such earlier time as currently provided in any applicable plan, program or arrangement, all Company Stock Options shall vest in their entirety and become exercisable under the terms of the Company Stock Plans and any restrictions or limitations on transfer with respect to restricted stock awarded under the Company Stock Plans shall terminate or lapse so that such shares shall be freely transferable subject to applicable securities laws. As of the Effective Time, all references in Company Stock Plans to Company Common Stock shall thereafter be deemed to be references to Parent Common Stock multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. 

  

 (c) Each of the Board of Directors and the compensation committee of the Company has adopted such resolutions and taken such other actions as may be required to adjust the terms of all outstanding Company Stock Options (each, as so adjusted, an "Adjusted Option"), and modify all Company Stock Plans to provide that, (x) at the Effective Time, each individual Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and converted, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option so that each such individual Company Stock Option to acquire shares of any class of the Company Common Stock will be converted into an option to acquire the number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by _multiplying_ (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option _by_ (ii) the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise price determined by _dividing_ (A) the exercise price set forth in the Company Stock Option by (B) the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) and (y) except as set forth on _Section 7.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter_, no provision of any Company Stock Plan or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary shall give any person the right to buy or receive any securities of Parent or any of its Affiliates following the Effective Time other than as provided in _Section 1.4_ hereof and this _Section 7.6(c)_ or the right to buy or receive any securities of the Surviving Corporation following 

  

    
  

 the Effective Time. Parent shall adopt at the Effective Time the Company
Stock Option Plans and each Adjusted Option and take all other action called
for in this _Section 7.6_, including the reservation, issuance and listing
of Parent Common Stock in a number at least equal to the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock that will be subject to the Adjusted Options.

  

 (d) Other than may result as a consequence of _Section 7.6(b)_, the adjustments provided in this _Section 7.6_ with respect to any Company Stock Options to which Section 421(a) of the Code applies shall be and are intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. 

  

 (e) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all necessary actions (including, if required to comply with Section 162(m) of the Code (and the regulations thereunder) or applicable law or rule of the NMS, obtaining the approval of its stockholders at the Parent Stockholders Meeting) to assume at the Effective Time all obligations undertaken by, or on behalf of, the Company under _Section 7.6(a)_. 

  

 (f) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or another appropriate form) registering a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of shares subject to the Adjusted Options and all other shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or reserved for issuance under the Company Stock Plans. Such registration statement shall be kept effective (and the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses required thereby shall be maintained) at least for so long as any Adjusted Options or any options or shares of stock granted under the Company Stock Plans after the Effective Time may remain outstanding. 

  

 (g) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to the holders of the Company Stock Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders\' rights pursuant to the respective Company Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the grants of such Company Stock Options and that the Company Stock Options and agreements shall be assumed by Parent and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this _Section 7.6_ after giving effect to the Merger). 

  

  

    
 Section 7.7 _ Fees and Expenses. _ 

  

  

 (a) Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such Expenses, except Expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including SEC filing fees) and the filing fees for the premerger notification and report forms under the HSR Act, which shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company. As used in this Agreement, "Expenses" means the out-of-pocket fees and expenses of the party\'s Independent Advisor, counsel and accountants, incurred by the party or on its behalf in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and the out-of-pocket expenses of the preparation, printing, filing and mailing of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the solicitation of stockholder approvals related to the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (b) (i) If after the execution hereof a Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or shall have been made directly to the stockholders of the Company generally or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Company Acquisition Proposal and thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ or _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ and within 12 months of such termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to, or approves or consummates, any Company Acquisition Proposal (for these purposes all references to 20% in the definition of Company Acquisition 

  

    
  

 Proposal shall be deemed to be references to 50%), then the Company shall
promptly, but in no event later than the date of the earliest of such entry,
approval or consummation, pay Parent a fee equal to $7,400,000 (the "Company
Termination Fee"), payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

    

 (ii) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_ (but only in the case of a willful breach), then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than one Business Day after such termination, pay Parent the Company Termination Fee, payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds. 

  

 (iii) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)_, then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than immediately prior to such termination, pay Parent the Company Termination Fee, payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds. 

   

 (iv) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ or _Section 9.1(f)_ and the Company has not paid and is not currently obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 7.7(b)_, then, the Company shall reimburse Parent (not later than five Business Days after submission of a statement therefor) for all out-of-pocket fees and expenses actually incurred by or own behalf of Parent in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein (including fees and disbursements payable to Parent\'s Independent Advisor, legal counsel and accountants for Parent) up to a maximum amount of $3,700,000; _provided_ , that, if the Company Termination Fee subsequently becomes payable to Parent, then any amounts previously paid by the Company to Parent under this Section 7.7(b)(iv) shall be offset against the amount of the Company Termination Fee. 

  

 (v) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 7.7(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 7.7(b)_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for any amount set forth in this _Section 7.7(b)_, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. 

    

 (c) (i) If after the execution hereof a Parent Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or shall have been made directly to the stockholders of Parent generally or any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Parent Acquisition Proposal and thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ or _Section 9.1(d)(ii)_ and within 12 months of such termination Parent or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any Parent Acquisition Agreement with respect to, or approves or consummates, any Parent Acquisition Proposal (for these purposes all references to 20% in the definition of Parent Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to 50%) then Parent shall promptly, but in no event later than the date of such termination, pay the Company a fee equal to $7,400,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee"), payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds. 

    

 (ii) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant _Section 9.1(e)_ (but only in the case of a willful breach), then Parent shall promptly, but in no event later than one Business Day after such termination, pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee, payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds. 

   

     

   

   

   

 (iii) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(h)_, then Parent shall promptly, but in no event later than immediately prior to such termination, pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee, payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds. 

  

 (iv) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(ii)_ or _Section 9.1(e)_ and Parent has not paid and is not currently obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 7.7(c)_, then, Parent shall reimburse the Company (not later than five Business Days after submission of a statement therefor) for all out-of-pocket fees and expenses actually incurred by or own behalf the Company in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein (including fees and disbursements payable to the Company\'s Independent Advisor, legal counsel and accountants for the Company) up to a maximum amount of $3,700,000; _provided_ , that, if the Parent Termination Fee subsequently becomes payable to the Company, then any amounts previously paid by Parent to the Company under this _Section 7.7(c)(iv)_ shall be offset against the amount of the Parent Termination Fee. 

  

 (v) Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 7.7(c)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Company would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Parent fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 7.7(c) _, and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit which results in a judgment against Parent for any amount set forth in this _Section 7.7(c)_, Parent shall pay to the Company its costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. 

   

  

    
 Section 7.8 _ Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance. _ 

  

  

 (a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including rights for advancement of expenses) now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. 

  

 (b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the Company\'s current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time with respect to those Persons who are currently covered by the Company\'s directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , that Parent may substitute therefor policies of Parent containing terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable to such directors and officers; _further provided_ , that in satisfying its obligation under this _Section 7.8(b)_ Parent shall not be obligated to pay premiums in excess of the amount set forth on _Section 7.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter_; and that if Parent is not able to obtain such coverage for such amount, Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained for such amount. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent may purchase six-year "tail" coverage covering acts or omissions prior to the Effective Time on substantially similar terms to the existing policy of the Company. 

  

 (c) In the event that Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.8_. 

  

    
  

 (d) The provisions of this _Section 7.8_ (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. 

  

  

    
 Section 7.9 _ Public Announcements. _ Promptly after the date hereof, Parent and the Company will develop a joint communications plan and each party will ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be consistent with such joint communications plan. Parent and the Company will consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any written public statement or making any presentations with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such written public statement or such presentation prior to such consultation and the reasonable approval of such press release, public statement or presentation by the other party, except as either party may determine is required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any securities exchange or national trading system.

 Section 7.10 _ NYSE Listing. _ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock and the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to be listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol "TSA," subject to official notice of issuance, as of or prior to the Effective Time. 

  

    
 Section 7.11 _ Affiliate Letter. _ 

  

  

 (a) At least five Business Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting (with updates as appropriate thereafter), the Company shall identify to Parent all persons who will be, at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, "affiliates" of the Company as that term is used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (including at a minimum, all those persons subject to the reporting requirements of Rule 16(a) under the Exchange Act). 

  

 (b) The Company shall obtain a written agreement in the form of _Exhibit B_ from each person who is identified as an Affiliate of such party pursuant to clause (a) above. The Company shall deliver such written agreements to Parent at least five Business Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting. 

  

  

    
 Section 7.12 _ Tax Treatment. _ Each of Parent and the Company and their respective Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code and to obtain the opinions of counsel referred to in _Sections 8.1(f)_ and _(g)_ , including the execution of the letters of representation referred to therein updated as necessary. The Company and Parent (and their Subsidiaries) shall treat the Parent Common Stock received in the Merger by holders of Company Common Stock as property permitted to be received by Section 354 of the Code without the recognition of gain. Each of the Company and Parent covenants and agrees to, and agrees to cause its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to defend in good faith all challenges to the treatment of the reorganization as described in this _Section 7.12_. Each of the Company and Parent agree that if it becomes aware of any such fact or circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code, it will promptly notify the other party in writing. Each of the Company and Parent will comply with all reporting and record-keeping obligations set forth in the Code and the Treasury regulations that are consistent with the Merger qualifying as a "reorganization" under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

    
 Section 7.13 _ Further Assurances. _ At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the 

    Company, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take any
other actions and do any other things, in the name and on behalf of the
Company, reasonably necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger.

  

    
 Section 7.14 _ Notices of Certain Events. _ Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other party of: 

  

  

 (a) the occurrence of any event whose occurrence would be likely to cause either (i) any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that is not so qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date hereof to the Effective Time, (ii) any condition set forth in _Article VIII_ to not be satisfied or (iii) any changes or events having, or which are reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable. 

  

 (b) any failure of such party to comply with in any material respect any covenant or agreement to be complied with by it hereunder; 

  

 (c) any facts relating to such party which would make it necessary or advisable to amend the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 in order to make the statements therein not misleading or to comply with applicable law; _provided, however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 7.14_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice; and 

   

 (d) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that a material consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

  

    
 Section 7.15 _ Stockholder Litigation. _ Each of Parent and the Company shall give the other the reasonable opportunity to consult in the defense of any stockholder litigation against Parent or the Company, as applicable, and its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 (d) By either the Company or Parent if (i) the approval by the stockholders of the Company required for the consummation of the Merger shall not have been obtained by reason of the 

  

    
  

 failure to obtain the required vote of the holders of the Company Common

postponement thereof or (ii) the approval by the stockholders of Parent
required for the consummation of the Merger shall not have been obtained by

 (f) By Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 8.2_ and (B) has not been or is incapable of being cured by the Company within 30 calendar days after its receipt of written notice thereof from Parent;

 Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1_ shall not be available to any party (a) that is in material breach of its obligations hereunder or (b) whose failure to fulfill its obligations or to comply with its covenants under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure to satisfy any condition to the obligations of either party hereunder. 

  

    
 Section 9.2 _ Effect of Termination. _ In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 9.1_ hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith be terminated and have no further effect except as specifically provided herein and, except as provided in this _Section 9.2_ and in _Sections 7.7_ and _10.10_ (each of which shall survive the termination hereof), there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto, provided that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any willful breach hereof. 

  

    
 Section 9.3 _ Amendments. _ This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of the Company and Parent, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange requires further approval by such stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

  

    
 Section 9.4 _ Waiver. _ At any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the Company Stockholders Meeting or the Parent Stockholders Meeting, any party hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the covenants, obligations or other acts of any other party hereto or (ii) waive any inaccuracy of any representations or warranties or compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions of any other party or with any conditions to its own obligations. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party by its duly authorized officer. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. The waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances 

    and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at
any time and from time to time.
