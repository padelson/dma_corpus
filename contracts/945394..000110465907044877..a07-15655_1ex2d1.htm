understood and agreed that once the Sellers Deductible Amount is exceeded the
Seller Indemnitees shall only be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.02 for Losses in excess of Sellers Deductible Amount;

  

### (b) the aggregate amount of all Losses to which the Seller Indemnitees
shall be entitled to indemnification from Purchaser shall not exceed the
Escrow Amount;

  

### (c) the Seller Indemnities will not be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.02 for punitive damages or for lost profits,
consequential, exemplary or special damages; and

  

### (d) no Seller Indemnitee is entitled to receive payment pursuant to this
Article IX for the same Loss relating to an indemnification claim more than
once.

  

## ** _Section 9.06_ _Limitations on Indemnification Payments to Purchaser
Indemnitees_.**

  

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:

        

### (a) the Purchaser Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.03(a) and (b) only to the extent the aggregate amount
of all Losses of the Purchaser Indemnitees as a result of any breach or
inaccuracy by a Seller, the Company or a Company Subsidiary exceeds
$3,500,000 (the " _Purchasers Deductible Amount_ "), provided that
"Losses" of the "Purchaser Indemnitees" (each defined in the TCA Purchase
Agreement) under the TCA Purchase Agreement shall be aggregated with Losses
under this Agreement in determining the Purchasers Deductible Amount, it
being understood and agreed that once the Purchasers Deductible Amount is
exceeded the Purchaser Indemnitees shall only be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.03 for Losses in excess of the Purchaser Deductible
Amount; provided, however, that the limitation set forth in this Section
9.06(a) shall not apply to Losses incurred by any Purchaser Indemnitee based
upon breach or inaccuracy of the representations set forth in Sections 3.03,
3.04, 3.09 (but only to the extent such representations relate to
Income Taxes), 4.02 or 4.03;

  

### (b) the Purchaser Indemnitees will not be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.03 for punitive damages or for lost profits,
consequential, exemplary or special damages; and

  

### (c) no Purchaser Indemnitee is entitled to receive payment pursuant to
this Article IX for the same Loss relating to an indemnification claim more
than once.

  

## ** _Section 9.07_ _Procedures._**

  

### (a) _Notice of Losses by Seller Indemnitee_. As soon as reasonably
practicable after a Seller Indemnitee becomes aware of any claim that it has
that may result in a Loss (a " _Seller Claim_ "), the Seller Indemnitee
shall give notice thereof (a " _Seller Claims Notice_ ") to the applicable
Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Indemnitor_ "). A Seller Claims Notice must
describe the Seller Claim in reasonable detail, and indicate the amount
(estimated, as necessary) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the
applicable Seller Indemnitee. No delay in or failure to give a Seller Claims
Notice by the Seller Indemnitee to the Purchaser Indemnitor pursuant to this
Section 9.07(a) will adversely affect any of the other rights or
remedies that a Seller Indemnitee has under this Agreement, or alter or
relieve the Purchaser Indemnitor of its obligation to indemnify the
applicable Seller Indemnitee, except to the extent that the Purchaser
Indemnitor is prejudiced thereby.

  

### (b) _Notice of Losses by Purchaser Indemnitee_. As soon as reasonably
practicable after a Purchaser Indemnitee becomes aware of any claim that it
has that may result in a Loss (a " _Purchaser Claim_ ") such
Purchaser Indemnitee shall give Notice thereof (a " _Purchaser Claims Notice_
") to the Sellers Representative. A Purchaser Claims Notice must describe the
Purchaser Claim in reasonable detail, and indicate the amount (estimated, as
necessary) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the applicable
Purchaser Indemnitee. No delay in or failure to give a Purchaser Claims
Notice by a Purchaser Indemnitee to the Sellers Representative pursuant to
this Section 9.07(b) will adversely affect any of the other rights or
remedies that the Purchaser Indemnitee has under this Agreement, or alter or
relieve the

        

## Purchaser Indemnitee of its right to indemnification except to the extent
that Sellers are prejudiced thereby.

  

## ** _Section 9.08_ _Opportunity to Defend Third Party Claims_.**

  

In the event of any claim by a third party against a Purchaser Indemnitee or
Seller Indemnitee (each an " _Indemnitee_ ") for which indemnification is
available hereunder from Purchaser or Sellers, as applicable (each an "
_Indemnifying Party_ "), the Indemnifying Party has the right, exercisable by
notice to the Indemnitee as applicable, within 120 days of receipt of a
written notice from the Indemnitee of such claim, to assume and conduct the
defense of such claim, with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee. If the Indemnifying Party has
assumed such defense as provided in this Section 9.08, the Indemnifying Party
will not be liable for any legal expenses incurred by any Indemnitee in
connection with the defense of such claim unless the Indemnitee determines in
good faith and upon the written advice of counsel that joint representation
by the Indemnifying Partys counsel constitutes a conflict of interest. If
the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of any third party claim
in accordance with this Section 9.08, the Indemnitee may defend such claim at
the sole cost of the Indemnifying Party (subject to the limitations set forth
in this Article IX), and the Indemnifying Party may still participate in, but
not control, the defense of such third party claim at the Indemnifying
Partys sole cost and expense. For so long as the Indemnifying Party is
defending such claim in good faith, the Indemnitee will not consent to a
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such claim,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Except with the prior written
consent of the Indemnitee (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), no Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim, will
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that (i)
provides for injunctive or other non-monetary relief affecting the
Indemnitee, (ii) provides for an admission of violation of any Law or the
rights of any Indemnitee, or (iii) does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnitee of a
release from all liability with respect to such claim or litigation. In any
such third party claim, the party responsible for the defense of such claim
shall, to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, keep such other
party informed as to the status of such claim, including, without limitation,
all settlement negotiations and offers; provided, however, that neither the
Indemnitee nor the Indemnifying Party shall be required to disclose any
privileged information or any attorney work product in connection with the
defense of any such asserted claim.

   

41  

  

## ** _Section 9.09_** ** ****_Exercise of Remedies by Indemnitees._**

  

No Purchaser Indemnitee shall be permitted to assert any indemnification
claim or exercise any other remedy under this Agreement unless Purchaser (or
any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall have consented to the
assertion of such indemnification claim or the exercise of such other remedy.
 No Seller Indemnitee shall be permitted to assert any indemnification claim
or exercise any other remedy under this Agreement unless the
Sellers Representative shall have consented to the assertion of such
Indemnification claim or the exercise of such other remedy.

  

## ** _Section 9.10_** ** ****_Adjustment to Purchase Price_** ** _._**

  

All indemnification, purchase price adjustments, reimbursement payments and
other payments made pursuant to this Agreement subsequent to the date of
this Agreement, as applicable, will be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price unless otherwise required by Law.

(or any of them) ever had, now has or hereinafter may have against
the Purchaser/Company Releasees (or any of them) from the beginning of the

Claims_ "), _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser/Company Released
Claims shall not include any rights under or pursuant to this Agreement or
any agreement or instrument executed in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the indemnification
provisions hereof. Nothing herein shall be deemed to release any rights any

policy or policies maintained for Purchaser/Company Releasors benefit by any
Purchaser/Company Releasee at any time on or prior to the Closing Date,
including, without limitation, general liability, directors and officers,

### release applies to, and forever releases, all such matters described in

## ** _Section 10.02_** ** _Releases by Sellers._**

  

### (a) For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of
which hereby are acknowledged, Sellers effective as of the Closing, for
themselves and their respective successors and assigns (collectively, the "
_Seller Releasors_ "), do absolutely and irrevocably release and discharge
forever Purchaser, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries and each of
their present and former representatives, stockholders, principals, officers,
directors, employees, benefit plans, agents, attorneys and each of their
successors and assignees (collectively, the " _Seller Releasees_ "), from any
and all claims, debts, actions, damages, obligations, liabilities, agreements
or promises of any nature whatsoever which the Seller Releasors (or any of
them) ever had, now has or hereinafter may have against the Seller Releasees
(or any of them) from the beginning of the world to the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Seller Released Claims_ "), _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that the Seller Released Claims shall not include any of the following: (i)
any rights under or pursuant to this Agreement or any agreement or instrument
executed in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including,
without limitation, the indemnification provisions hereof, or (ii) any right
of a Seller Releasor to indemnification pursuant to the Organizational
Documents of the Company or the Operating Company, any employee plan or any
other agreement, in each case, as in effect on the date hereof. Nothing
herein shall be deemed to release any rights any Seller Releasor may have to
make any claims under any insurance policy or policies maintained for such
Seller Releasors benefit by any Seller Releasee at any time on or prior to
the Closing Date, including, without limitation, general liability, directors
and officers, errors and omissions or malpractice insurance.

  

### (b) Sellers have fully read and understand all of the terms and
conditions set forth in this Section 10.02 and their legal consequences, and

this general release applies to, and forever releases, all such matters
described in the immediately preceding sentence.

  

# **ARTICLE XI**

  

# **TAX MATTERS**

  

## ** _Section 11.01_** ** _Tax Treatment._**

  

The parties shall treat the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the TCA Purchase Agreement in accordance with Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1
C.B. 432 (Situation 2) as follows (i) (A) as a sale of 100% of the "Operating
Company Interests" (as defined in the TCA Purchase Agreement) by the partners
of the Operating Company and (B) thereafter as a sale of 100% of the Company
Interests by Sellers, and (ii) (A) as a purchase by TCA of all of the assets
of the Operating Company and assumption by TCA of all of the Operating
Companys liabilities and (B) thereafter, as a purchase by Purchaser of all
of the assets of the Company and

       

assumption by Purchaser of all of the Companys liabilities. The parties
shall (x) treat each such transaction as occurring after all other
transactions, including those contemplated by Section 6.13 and 6.14 of
the TCA Purchase Agreement, __ on the Closing Date and (y) treat the
transactions described in Sections 11.01(i)(A) and 11.01(ii)(A) as occurring
prior to the transactions described in Sections 11.01(i)(B) and 11.01(ii)(B).

  

## ** _Section 11.02_** ** _Tax Returns_** ** _._**

  

### (a) _Partnership Tax Returns_. After the Closing Date, the Sellers
Representative, at its own cost and expense, shall be responsible for
preparing and timely filing all Partnership Tax Returns, for each of
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date that is
treated as a partnership or disregarded entity for federal Income Tax
purposes, for all Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date.  Such
Partnership Tax Returns will report the operations of the Company, and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, in accordance with applicable Law. To the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the Sellers Representative shall cause such
Partnership Tax Returns to be filed and signed by a pre-Closing partner of
the Company. The Sellers Representative shall pay or cause Sellers to pay any
Taxes that are due (i) with respect to any Partnership Tax Returns that are
the responsibility of the Sellers Representative pursuant to this Section
11.02(a), including any applicable state or local Tax withholding on the
income reported on such Partnership Tax Returns and (ii) any applicable
federal, state or local withholding Taxes with respect to distributions from
the Company or the Operating Company to their respective partners.  If, and
to the extent, Purchaser or its Affiliate is required under applicable Law to
sign, authorize a Seller to sign and/or participate in any Partnership Tax
Return for any period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers
Representative shall provide Purchaser a copy of such Partnership Tax Return
at least ten (10) days prior to its due date, and Purchaser shall cooperate
with respect to the filing of such Partnership Tax Return pursuant to Section
11.06 hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, a Partnership Tax Returns use of a
purchase price allocation in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code, even
if different than Purchasers allocation, shall not be considered
unreasonable. If the Sellers Representative prepares a Partnership Tax Return
showing SPS Income Taxes are due, the Sellers Representative shall provide
Purchaser a copy of such Partnership Tax Return at least ten (10) days prior
to its due date, and such Tax Return shall be subject to Purchasers
reasonable review and approval.

  

### (b) _Other Tax Returns_. Except as set forth in Section 11.02(a)
or Section 11.05, Purchaser shall, at it own cost and expense, be responsible
for preparing and filing all Tax Returns of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that are due following the Closing Date, subject to Purchasers
right to indemnification under Article IX hereof.

  

## ** _Section 11.03_** ** _Post-Closing Audits._**

  

### (a) Purchaser shall notify the Sellers Representative in writing within
20 days after receipt by Purchaser or the Company or its Subsidiaries of
written notice of the commencement of any official inquiry, examination,
audit or other administrative or judicial proceeding (" _Audit_ ") regarding
any Tax Return or Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period; provided, that the
failure to provide such notice shall not relieve Sellers of their obligations

       

### pursuant to Article IX or this Article XI, except to the extent Sellers
are actually prejudiced thereby. The Sellers Representative shall
notify Purchaser in writing within 20 days after receipt by the Sellers
Representative or any Seller of written notice of the commencement of any
Audit regarding any Tax Return (other than with respect to any matter
pertaining to a Partnership Tax Return which (i) could not reasonably be
expected to involve any potential liability on the part of the Company, the
Operating Company, Purchaser or any of their post-Closing Affiliates and (ii)
does not result in SPS Income Taxes) or Taxes of the Company, or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  

### (b) Provided that Sellers may be responsible under Article IX or XI for
any Taxes that might result, the Sellers Representative shall have the right,
exercised by written notice given to Purchaser within 20 days after delivery
or receipt by the Sellers Representative of a notice pursuant to Section
11.03(a), on behalf of Sellers and at the expense of Sellers, to control the
handling, disposition and/or settlement of any Audit regarding any Pre-
Closing Tax Period; provided, that the Sellers Representative shall defend
such Audit diligently and in good faith, and shall keep Purchaser reasonably
informed as to the status of and material developments in such Audit and
provide Purchaser with copies of any written materials relating to such Audit
received from or submitted to any Governmental Entity; provided further that
if such Audit could have an adverse impact on Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries (1) the Sellers Representative shall consult with
Purchaser before taking any significant action in connection with such Audit;
(2) the Sellers Representative shall offer Purchaser a reasonable opportunity
to comment before submitting to any Governmental Entity any written materials
prepared or furnished in connection with such Audit; (3) Purchaser (or an
Affiliate of Purchaser) shall be entitled to participate, at its own expense,
in such Audit, including by attending meetings with the relevant Governmental
Entity; and (4) the Sellers Representative shall not settle, compromise or
abandon the Audit without obtaining prior written consent of Purchaser, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  If the
Sellers Representative fails to exercise its right to control the conduct of
any Audit described in this Section 11.04(b), Purchaser may, to the extent
such Audit relates to Purchaser or the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries,
conduct, defend and settle the Audit in such manner as it deems appropriate
in its sole discretion, and Sellers shall, jointly and severally, promptly
pay or reimburse Purchaser, as applicable, for any costs or expenses incurred
in connection with the conduct, defense or settlement of such Audit.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except with respect to any matter
pertaining to a Partnership Tax Return which (i) could not reasonably be
expected to involve any potential liability on the part of the Company, the
Operating Company, Purchaser or any of their post-Closing Affiliates and (ii)
does not result in SPS Income Taxes, the provisions of this Section 11.03(b)
shall not apply to any Partnership Tax Returns for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period.

  

### (c) Purchaser shall have the right, at its own expense, to exercise
control over the handling, disposition and/or settlement of any Audit
regarding any Tax Return other than as described in Section 11.03(b) above
(including the right to settle or otherwise terminate any contest with
respect thereto); provided, that in the case of any Tax Return for a period
beginning before the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not settle any issue that
would result in a required indemnification payment by Sellers under Article
IX or XI without the prior consent of the Sellers Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

       

### (d) (i) The Sellers Representative shall notify Purchaser if, in the
course of any Audit, Sellers purchase price allocation under Section 1060 of
the Code is challenged by the IRS or any other Governmental Entity, and (ii)
Purchaser shall notify the Sellers Representative if, in the course of any
Audit, Purchasers purchase price allocation under Section 1060 of the Code
is challenged by the IRS or any other Governmental Entity.

  

## ** _Section 11.04_** ** ****_Transfer Taxes_** ** _._**

  

Except for any Transfer Taxes (as defined below) which result from the
actions taken pursuant to Section 6.13 and Section 6.14(c) of the TCA
Purchase Agreement (which Transfer Taxes shall be Reimbursable Costs), all
transfer, real estate transfer, excise, sales, use, documentary, stamp Taxes
and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other similar Taxes (including
interest, penalties and additions to any such Taxes) in each case including
any such Taxes or fees levied upon the transfer of stock or other equity
interests in an entity on account of such entitys direct or indirect
ownership of real estate (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid one-half by
Purchaser and one-half by Sellers. Purchaser and Sellers agree to
use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with respect to minimizing
any such Transfer Taxes. Purchaser shall prepare and file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to such Transfer Taxes. Sellers
shall reimburse Purchaser one-half of the cost and expense of preparing and
filing such Tax Returns. In addition, Purchaser shall provide any Tax forms
or other information reasonably requested by the Sellers Representative for
the purpose of reducing fuel excise Taxes.

  

## ** _Section 11.05_** ** ****_Tax Cooperation_** ** _._**

  

From and after the Closing Date, each of Purchaser, the Sellers
Representative and Sellers shall, at the cost of the requesting party,
cooperate, as reasonably requested, in connection with the preparation and
filing of any Tax Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and in
connection with any Audits with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request,
at the requesting partys cost and expense) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Audit.  Purchaser and
Sellers shall, upon request, use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Entity or any
other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax
that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby). Purchaser and Sellers agree that TCA may,
at TCAs sole option, discretion and cost, which shall include all Tax
liabilities resulting from such elections, make an election under Section 338
of the Code (and any corresponding election under state, local, or foreign
Tax Law) with respect to deemed purchase of the stock of any Company
Subsidiary hereunder and each Seller agrees to cooperate with respect to any
such election. Purchaser, Sellers Representative and each Seller each agree
to (i) treat each Special Purpose Subsidiary as a disregarded entity under
Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-2 and -3 (and as a disregarded entity
for state and local Tax purposes to the maximum extent possible) for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period and any Tax period that includes the Closing Date, (ii)
not make any affirmative election (such as on IRS Form 8832) contrary to such
disregarded entity status and (iii) take steps at Purchasers request and
expense to minimize any SPS Income Taxes.

       

## ** _Section 11.06_** ** ****_Conflicts_** ** _._**

  

In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Article XI and
Article IX, this Article XI shall exclusively govern any matters relating to
Taxes.

### Sellers Representative based on acts or omissions taken or omitted by
