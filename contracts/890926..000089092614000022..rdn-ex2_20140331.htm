(the "Company"), (iii) Cobra Green LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
("Cobra Green"), and Paul T. Bossidy (each such party, a "Unitholder," and
collectively, the "Unitholders"), and Cobra Green, in its role as the
Unitholder Representative (the "Unitholder Representative"). Each of
Purchaser, the Company and each Unitholder is referred to herein as a "Party"
and collectively as the "Parties." Capitalized terms used herein and not
otherwise defined have the meanings set forth in Schedule II hereto. 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, Cobra Green and Paul T. Bossidy ("Bossidy") own, in the aggregate,
one hundred percent (100%) of the outstanding Class A Units of the Company
(the "Class A Units");

WHEREAS, Bossidy also owns one hundred percent (100%) of the outstanding Class
B Units of the Company (the "Class B Units");

WHEREAS, each of Cobra Green and Bossidy desires to sell to Purchaser, and
Purchaser desires to acquire from Cobra Green and Bossidy, all of the
outstanding Class A Units held by such Unitholder, and Bossidy desires to sell
to Purchaser, and Purchaser desires to acquire from Bossidy, all of the
outstanding Class B Units held by him, in each case, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein (collectively, the "Transaction"); and

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, each of Paul
Bossidy and Joseph D'Urso (the "Executives") is entering into a letter
agreement with Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries setting forth the material
terms of each such Executive's employment with Purchaser or one of its
Subsidiaries (each, a "Letter Agreement"), dated as of the date hereof, to be
effective as of (and subject to the occurrence of) the Closing, and which
shall supersede each Executive's employment agreement with the Company.

AGREEMENTS

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants,
representations and warranties contained herein and intending to be legally
bound hereby, the Parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

SALE AND PURCHASE OF CLASS A UNITS AND CLASS B UNITS

1.1 Sale and Purchase of Class A Units and Class B Units. On the terms and
subject to the conditions contained herein, in consideration for the aggregate
purchase price specified in Section 1.2, on the Closing Date, (a) each
Unitholder severally agrees to sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to
purchase from each such Unitholder, the Class A Units shown opposite such
Unitholder's name on Schedule I, free and clear of all Liens, and (b) Bossidy
agrees to sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to purchase from Bossidy,
the Class B Units shown opposite Bossidy's name on Schedule I

1.2 Purchase Price. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, in consideration of the Class A Units and Class B Units being sold
hereunder, on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay to the Unitholders an
aggregate amount equal to the sum of: (a) Three Hundred Five Million dollars
($305,000,000) (the "Enterprise Value"); plus or minus, as applicable, (b) the
Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment; minus (c) the Escrow Amount; minus (d)
the Indebtedness; and minus (e) the Selling Expenses (the sum of the foregoing
clauses (a)-(e), the "Closing Cash Payment"). At the Closing, Purchaser shall
pay the Closing Cash Payment by (i) first, paying Bossidy an amount equal to
the Aggregate Incentive Pool (such amount to be determined by the Board at
least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing) and (ii) second, paying each
Unitholder an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the remainder of the
Closing Cash Payment (after giving effect to the payment of the Aggregate
Incentive Pool), in each case, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
pursuant to instructions delivered and signed by the Unitholders, in a form
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser (the "Payment Instruction"), at least two
(2) Business Days prior to the Closing. The aggregate amount equal to the sum
of: (A) the Closing Cash Payment; plus (B) the Escrow Amount to the extent
disbursed to Unitholders pursuant to the Escrow Agreement; plus or minus, as
applicable, (C) any adjustment made pursuant to Section 1.5; plus (D) the
Indebtedness; and plus (E) the Selling Expenses shall be referred to herein as
the "Purchase Price."



1.3 Escrow Account.

(a) At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"), under the escrow agreement
dated the Closing Date, by and among Purchaser, the Unitholder Representative
and the Escrow Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the
"Escrow Agreement"), an amount equal to Ten Million Eight Hundred Fifty
Thousand dollars ($10,850,000) (the "Escrow Amount"). The Escrow Amount shall
be held in an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement and released and paid on the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing (the "Escrow Termination Date") in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agreement will provide that the
Escrow Amount will be used in connection with any amount payable to Purchaser
pursuant to Section 1.5(e)(i) and to satisfy claims for Losses made by
Purchaser required to be indemnified pursuant and subject to Article VIII
hereof. All Parties hereto agree for all Tax purposes that: (i) the right of
the Unitholders to the Escrow Amount shall be treated as deferred contingent
purchase price eligible for installment treatment under Section 453 of the
Code and any corresponding provision of foreign, state or local Law, as
appropriate, (ii) Purchaser shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow
Account, and all interest and earnings earned from the investment and
reinvestment of the Escrow Amount, or any portion thereof, shall be allocable
to Purchaser pursuant to Section 468B(g) of the Code and Proposed Treasury
Regulation Section 1.468B-8), (iii) if and to the extent any amount of the
Escrow Amount is actually distributed to the Unitholders, interest shall be
imputed on such amount as required by Section 483 or 1274 of the Code, and
(iv) in no event shall the aggregate amount payable to the Unitholders from
the Escrow Account exceed Fifteen Million dollars ($15,000,000). Clause (iv)
of the preceding sentence is intended to ensure that the right of the
Unitholders to the Escrow Amount and any interest and earnings earned thereon
is not treated as a contingent payment without a stated maximum selling price
under Section 453 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. No Party shall take any action or filing position inconsistent
with the foregoing.

(b) If at any time all or any portion of the Escrow Amount is released to the
Unitholder Representative in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, then the Unitholder Representative shall (i) promptly re-determine
(x) the Aggregate Incentive Pool, (y) the Incentive Payments and (z) the
Special Bonus and (ii) subject to the immediately succeeding sentence,
distribute such amount among the Unitholders, the Participants and Joseph
D'Urso in accordance with the terms of the LLC Agreement, the Management
Incentive Plan and the D'Urso Employment Agreement (as determined by the
Unitholder Representative), each as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing; provided that any such distributions to the Participants and Joseph
D'Urso shall be made subject to Purchaser's receipt of an acknowledgement, in
a form reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, from each Participant and Joseph
D'Urso. The Unitholder Representative shall wire any amount payable to any
Participant and/or Joseph D'Urso pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence to the Company and, promptly upon receipt thereof, the Company shall,
and Purchaser shall cause the Company to, pay such amounts to the Participants
and Joseph D'Urso through its payroll (subject to any required withholding)
(it being expressly agreed that the Participants and Joseph D'Urso shall be
third-party beneficiaries of this Section 1.3(b), each of whom may enforce the
provisions of this Section 1.3(b)). Any amounts payable to the Unitholders
pursuant to this Section 1.3(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account(s) designated in writing by each such
Unitholder.

1.4 Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment. No later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser (i) an
estimated unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of 11:59 p.m. EST on the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date, provided that such estimated unaudited consolidated balance sheet shall
give effect to (x) the MSLS Distribution, regardless of whether the MSLS
Distribution has been consummated prior to such time and (y) any cash
distributions initiated by the Company pursuant to Section 6.6(ii) at or prior
to the Closing, regardless of whether any cash so distributed has been debited
from the Company\'s bank accounts as of 11:59 p.m. EST on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, and (ii) a statement (the "Estimated Preliminary
Statement"), in each case prepared in good faith and in accordance with the
Financial Statements, setting forth an estimate of the Closing Date Net
Working Capital Amount (the "Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital
Amount"). If the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital Amount exceeds
Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand dollars ($7,500,000) (the "Target Net
Working Capital Amount"), the Closing Cash Payment will be increased dollar-
for-dollar by the amount of such excess and if the Estimated Closing Date Net
Working Capital Amount is less than the Target Net Working Capital Amount, the
Closing Cash Payment shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such
shortfall, as provided for in Section 1.2. The amount by which the Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital Amount exceeds or is less than, as
applicable, the Target Net Working Capital Amount shall be referred to herein
as the "Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment."

1.5 Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) Purchaser shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Unitholder
Representative, as soon as practicable, but in no event more than sixty (60)
days after the Closing Date, (i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of 11:59 p.m. EST on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date (which shall give effect to (x) the MSLS
Distribution, regardless of whether the MSLS Distribution has been consummated
prior to such time and (y) 

any cash distributions initiated by the Company pursuant to Section 6.6(ii) at
or prior to the Closing, regardless of whether any cash so distributed has
been debited from the Company\'s bank accounts as of 11:59 p.m. EST on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and (ii)
a preliminary statement (the "Preliminary Statement") prepared in good faith
and setting forth the calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital
Amount as derived from the Closing Balance Sheet, in each case of clauses (i)
and (ii), along with reasonable supporting detail to evidence the calculations
of such amounts. The Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Date Net Working
Capital Amount and all of the calculations set forth therein shall be prepared
in accordance with the Financial Statements.

(b) The Unitholder Representative shall have sixty (60) days to review the
Preliminary Statement from the date of its receipt thereof (the "Review
Period"). During the Review Period, the Unitholder Representative shall have
reasonable access during normal business hours to the books and records,
personnel and advisors of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent
required in connection with such review. If the Unitholder Representative
objects to any aspect of the Preliminary Statement, the Unitholder
Representative must deliver a written notice of objection (the "Objection
Notice") to Purchaser on or prior to the expiration of the Review Period
setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for any such objection. If the
Unitholder Representative delivers an Objection Notice to Purchaser prior to
the expiration of the Review Period as provided in this Section 1.5(b),
Purchaser and the Unitholder Representative shall, for a period of thirty (30)
days thereafter (the "Resolution Period"), attempt in good faith to resolve
the matters contained therein, and any written resolution, signed by each of
Purchaser and the Unitholder Representative, as to any such matter shall be
final, binding, conclusive and non-appealable for all purposes hereunder. In
the event the Unitholder Representative does not deliver an Objection Notice
to Purchaser as provided in this Section 1.5(b) prior to the expiration of the
Review Period, the Unitholders shall be deemed to have agreed to the
Preliminary Statement in its entirety, which Preliminary Statement or
undisputed portions thereof (as the case may be) shall be final, binding,
conclusive and non-appealable for all purposes hereunder.

(c) If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, Purchaser and the
Unitholder Representative have not reached an agreement with respect to all
disputed matters contained in the Objection Notice, then within ten (10)
Business Days thereafter, Purchaser and the Unitholder Representative shall
submit for resolution those of such matters remaining in dispute to KPMG, or
if such firm is unavailable or unwilling to so serve, to a mutually acceptable
nationally recognized independent accounting or financial consulting firm (the
"Neutral Arbitrator"). The Neutral Arbitrator shall act as an arbitrator to
resolve (based solely on the written and oral presentations of Purchaser and
the Unitholder Representative and not by independent review) only those
matters submitted to it in accordance with the first sentence of this Section
1.5(c). Purchaser and the Unitholder Representative shall direct the Neutral
Arbitrator to render a resolution of all such disputed matters within thirty
(30) days after its engagement or such other period agreed upon in writing by
Purchaser and the Unitholder Representative. The resolution of the Neutral
Arbitrator shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to each of the
Parties and shall be final, binding, conclusive and non-appealable for all
purposes hereunder. The Preliminary Statement, once modified and/or agreed to
in accordance with Section 1.5(b) or this Section 1.5(c), shall become the
"Final Statement."

(d) All fees and expenses relating to the work performed by the Neutral
Arbitrator shall be allocated equally between the Unitholders (based on their
respective Pro Rata Shares on a several and not joint basis), on the one hand,
and Purchaser, on the other hand, with any such fees and expenses due from the
Unitholders to be paid out of the Escrow Amount. Except as provided in the
preceding sentence, all other costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in
connection with resolving any dispute hereunder before the Neutral Arbitrator
shall be borne by the Party incurring such cost and expense.

(e) Amounts payable pursuant to the determination of the Closing Date Net
Working Capital Amount on the Final Statement will be paid and/or disbursed as
follows:

(i) If the Closing Date Net Working Capital Amount as stated on the Final
Statement is less than the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital Amount,
then the Unitholder Representative and Purchaser shall promptly execute and
deliver a written instruction to the Escrow Agent to effectuate disbursement
of the amount of any such shortfall between the Estimated Closing Date Net
Working Capital Amount and the Closing Date Net Working Capital Amount from
the Escrow Amount to Purchaser in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.

(ii) If the Closing Date Net Working Capital Amount as stated on the Final
Statement is greater than the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital
Amount, then, within three (3) Business Days after the date on which the
Preliminary Statement becomes the Final Statement, the Unitholder
Representative shall (A) promptly re-determine (x) the Aggregate Incentive
Pool, (y) the Incentive Payments and (z) the Special Bonus and (B) subject to
the immediately succeeding sentence, distribute such excess amount among the
Unitholders, the Participants and Joseph D'Urso in accordance with the terms
of the LLC Agreement, the Management Incentive Plan and the D'Urso Employment
Agreement (as determined by the Unitholder Representative), each as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing; provided that any such distributions to the
Participants and Joseph D'Urso shall be made subject to Purchaser's receipt of
an acknowledgement, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, from each
Participant and Joseph D'Urso. The Unitholder Representative shall wire any
amount 

payable to any Participant and/or Joseph D'Urso pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence to the Company and, promptly upon receipt thereof, the
Company shall, and Purchaser shall cause the Company to, pay such amounts to
the Participants and Joseph D'Urso through its payroll (subject to any
required withholding) (it being expressly agreed that the Participants and
Joseph D'Urso shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 1.5(e)(ii),
each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 1.5(e)(ii)). Any
amounts payable to the Unitholders pursuant to this Section 1.5(e)(ii) shall
be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s)
designated in writing by each such Unitholder.

1.6 Tax Treatment.

(a) The Parties acknowledge that the transactions effected pursuant to this
Agreement are intended to be treated for federal income tax purposes and any
relevant state or local income tax purposes as follows, consistent with the
principles set forth in Situation 2 of Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 CB 432
(Jan. 15, 1999):

(i) the Company shall be treated as terminating pursuant to Section
708(b)(1)(A) of the Code;

(ii) with respect to the Unitholders, the sale and purchase of the Class A
Units and the Class B Units shall be treated as a sale of the Class A Units
and Class B Units to Purchaser, with gain or loss reported by the Unitholders
in accordance with Section 741 of the Code; and

(iii) with respect to Purchaser, the sale and purchase of the Class A Units
and Class B Units shall be treated as the Company making a liquidating
distribution of all of its assets and all of its liabilities to the
Unitholders in exchange for the Class A Units and Class B Units and,
immediately following such liquidating distribution, Purchaser acquiring, by
purchase, all of the Company's assets and liabilities from the Unitholders.

(b) Within ninety (90) days following the completion of the Final Statement,
Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Unitholder Representative a
proposed allocation of the Purchase Price and any additional amounts treated
as consideration for applicable Tax purposes (the "Total Consideration") among
the assets of the Company, which allocation shall be reasonable and in
accordance with the principles of Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Proposed Allocation"). Purchaser and
the Unitholder Representative shall endeavor in good faith to agree, within
sixty (60) days after the delivery of the Proposed Allocation, on an
allocation of the Total Consideration among the assets of the Company (the
"Allocation"). If Purchaser and the Unitholder Representative have agreed on
an Allocation by such date, Purchaser and the Unitholder Representative shall
(except as may be required by a "determination" within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code or any similar state, local or foreign Tax law) (i) report
the allocation of the Total Consideration among the assets of the Company in
accordance with such Allocation and (ii) act in accordance with such
Allocation (x) in the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns and (y) in the
course of any tax proceeding. Purchaser and the Unitholder Representative
shall promptly inform one another of any challenge by any Taxing Authority of
which it becomes aware to such Allocation and agree to consult and keep one
another informed with respect to the status of, and any discussion, proposal
or submission with respect to, such challenge. If Purchaser and the Unitholder
Representative have not agreed on an Allocation by such date, Purchaser and
the Unitholder Representative shall endeavor in good faith to resolve such
disagreement. If Purchaser and the Unitholder Representative are unable to
resolve such disagreement within fifteen (15) days, each of Purchaser and the
Unitholder Representative shall use its own allocation Any adjustments made to
the Purchase Price shall be allocated among the assets of the Company in the
same manner as set forth in this Section 1.6(b).

(c) Each Party agrees that, for all Tax purposes, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will be reported in a manner that is consistent
with this Section 1.6, and none of them (nor any of their respective
Affiliates) will take any Tax position inconsistent therewith on any Tax
Return or otherwise unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

obtain from any Governmental Entity or any other third party any Consents or
Orders required to be obtained or made by the Company, the Unitholders or
Purchaser in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the consummation of the
Transaction, including those set forth in Schedule 3.1(c); (c) as promptly as
practicable, make all necessary filings, and thereafter make and cooperate
with the other Parties with respect to any other required submissions, with
respect to this Agreement and the Transaction required under (i) any
applicable U.S. federal or state or foreign securities Laws, (ii) the HSR Act
and any related governmental request thereunder (it being agreed that the
Company and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts, within ten
(10) Business 

Days after the execution of this Agreement, to make the necessary filing with
the appropriate Governmental Entity in accordance with the HSR Act and
thereafter to seek early termination with respect thereto) and any other
competition notifications applicable to the Transaction, and (iii) any other
applicable Law; and (d) execute or deliver any additional instruments
reasonably necessary to consummate the Transaction in accordance with the
terms hereof; and (e) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings,
and thereafter make and cooperate with the other Parties with respect to, and
promptly provide to the applicable state licensing authorities any and all
information required in connection with, obtaining the consents and approvals
(or new licenses) contemplated by Sections 7.2(g) and (h) (it being understood
that failure to comply with this clause (e) shall be deemed a material breach
of this Agreement for purposes of Section 2.3(a)). Each Party shall supply as
promptly as practicable any additional information or documentation that may
be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable Law; provided,
however, that any information of documentation provided pursuant to this
sentence may be redacted as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client
privilege concerns.

(b) Each Party shall, in connection with the actions referenced in Section
6.1(a) to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the
Transaction under the HSR Act or any other applicable Law, (i) cooperate with
each other in connection with any communication, filing or submission; (ii)
keep the other Parties and/or its counsel informed of any communication
received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the FTC, the DOJ or
any other Governmental Entity, in each case regarding the Transaction; and
(iii) permit the other Party and/or its counsel to review in advance any
submission, filing or communication (and documents submitted therewith)
intended to be given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity,
and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other Governmental
Entity, give the other Party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the failure to obtain any Consent or Order set
forth in Schedule 3.1(c) shall not in and of itself serve as the basis for
Purchaser to seek indemnification under Article VIII, provided that the
Company and the Unitholders used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
such Consent or Order pursuant to this Section 6.1 and otherwise did not
breach this Agreement or take any other action that would be indemnifiable
under Article VIII.

6.2 Notification. Prior to the Closing or the earlier termination of this
Agreement, the Company and the Unitholder Representative shall promptly
disclose to Purchaser any event, development or occurrence which would result
in the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) becoming incapable of being
satisfied (any such disclosure, an "MAE Notice"), affirmatively state that
such matter would result in the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) being
incapable of being satisfied and promptly provide Purchaser with any
information reasonably requested by Purchaser with respect to the matters
specified in any MAE Notice. Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement for failure to satisfy the closing condition set forth in Section
7.2(a) by providing written notice to the Unitholder Representative prior to
the Closing electing to so terminate this Agreement; provided that if
Purchaser does not elect to terminate this Agreement prior to the Closing,
then Purchaser shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived its right to
indemnification under Article VIII with respect to the specific matters
expressly described in the MAE Notice.

6.3 Confidentiality.

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that the information provided to it in connection
with this Agreement and the Transaction is subject to the terms of the letter
agreement by and between the Company and Purchaser, dated January 21, 2014
(the "Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality Agreement"), the terms of which are
incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing,
the Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. In the event
that this Agreement terminates pursuant to Section 2.3, however, the Non-
Disclosure and Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms. The Parties hereto agree that any
information provided by Purchaser or its Affiliates to the Company, the
Unitholders or their respective Affiliates in connection with this Agreement
and the Transaction, including information regarding integration and future
business planning, shall be protected in the same manner that information
provided by the Company to Purchaser is protected from disclosure and use
under the Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality Agreement, mutatis mutandis.

(b) From the Closing until the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date,
each of the Unitholders agrees that it shall not disclose to any Person not
employed by Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser or not engaged to render
services to Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser, or use for the benefit of
itself or others, any confidential information or trade secrets of the Company
or its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that this Section 6.3(b) shall not
preclude any Unitholder from use or disclosure of such information (i) if use
or disclosure of such information is required by applicable Law, (ii) if use
or disclosure of such information is required in connection with any bona fide
claim against or involving such Unitholder, (iii) if such information is
readily ascertainable from public information other than as a result of a
breach of the confidentiality obligations herein by any Unitholder, (iv) if
such Unitholder receives such information on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective officers, directors, managers, employees, agents or 

representatives, provided that such source is not known (after due inquiry) by
such Unitholder to be subject to a contractual, legal, fiduciary or other
obligation of confidentiality with respect to such information, or (v) if such
information is or was independently developed by such Unitholder without the
use of or reference to any such information; provided, further, that in the
case of clauses (i) and (ii), the applicable Unitholder shall provide
Purchaser, to the extent practicable, with adequate prior notice to allow
Purchaser to seek an appropriate protective order, and shall reasonably
cooperate with Purchaser (at Purchaser's sole expense) in connection
therewith; provided, further, that nothing in this Section 6.3(b) shall limit
or restrict the disclosure or use of any such confidential information by any
Unitholder who is an officer, director, manager or employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in the performance of such Unitholder's duties as such
on behalf of the Company and/or any of such Subsidiaries.

6.4 Publicity. The Parties hereto will, and will cause each of their
respective Affiliates and representatives to, maintain the confidentiality of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and will not, and will
cause each of their respective Affiliates not to, issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior
written consent of the Unitholder Representative and Purchaser, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that (a) upon the
execution of this Agreement each party may release its own press release in
the form previously agreed and upon the Closing the Unitholder Representative
and Purchaser shall release a mutually agreed upon joint press release, (b) a
Party may, without the prior consent of Purchaser and Unitholder
Representative, issue or cause publication of any such press release or public
announcement to the extent that such party reasonably determines, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, such action to be required by Law or
by the rules of any applicable self-regulatory organization or stock exchange,
in which event such Party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
consult with Purchaser and the Unitholder Representative and allow reasonable
time to comment on such press release or public announcement in advance of its
issuance and (c) nothing in this Section 6.4 shall prohibit any institutional
Unitholder from disclosing any information relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to any current or prospective investor or
limited partner of such Unitholder to the extent such disclosure is
customarily made in the ordinary course of such Unitholder's business.

6.5 Tax Matters.

(a) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
similar Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and
charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
consummation of the Transaction ("Transfer Taxes"), shall be borne equally by
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Unitholders, on the other hand. All
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes shall be timely filed by the party primarily responsible for
such filing under applicable Law.

(b) (i) The Unitholder Representative shall have the right to elect to cause
to be prepared, at the expense of the Unitholders (based on their respective
Pro Rata Shares on a several and not joint basis, with any such expenses due
from the Unitholders to be paid out of the Escrow Amount), all income,
franchise or other similar Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
all Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date (including any Tax Return
required to be filed by the Company in respect of Quantum Servicing
Corporation, a Delaware corporation) and any other Tax Returns of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries for all Tax periods ending on or before the Closing
Date if the Unitholders may be obligated to indemnify Purchaser for such Taxes
under this Agreement ("Pre-Closing Tax Returns"), by providing reasonable
prior notice to Purchaser and the Company. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared
in a manner consistent with past practice. If the Unitholder Representative
has elected to prepare such Tax Returns, the Unitholder Representative shall
provide Purchaser drafts of the Pre-Closing Tax Returns for its review and
approval at least thirty (30) days prior to the filing of such Tax Returns,
and Purchaser shall timely file or cause to be timely filed all such Tax
Returns of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries.

(ii) If the Unitholder Representative has not elected to prepare such Tax
Returns, Purchaser shall, at the expense of the Unitholders (based on their
respective Pro Rata Shares on a several and not joint basis, with any such
expenses due from the Unitholders to be paid out of the Escrow Amount),
prepare such Tax Returns consistent with the provisions of this Section
6.5(b), and shall provide such Tax Returns to the Unitholder Representative
for its review and approval at least thirty (30) days prior to filing.

(iii) Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared any Tax Returns of the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries for all Tax periods that begin on or
before and end after the Closing Date (all such Tax Returns, the "Straddle
Returns"). Such Straddle Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practice. Purchaser shall provide drafts of such Straddle Returns to the
Unitholder Representative for its review and approval at least thirty (30)
days prior to filing.

(iv) In the event of a dispute with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Returns or
Straddle Returns (whether prepared by the Unitholder Representative or
Purchaser) described in this Section 6.5(b), the Parties shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve such dispute for thirty (30) days. Any dispute that
cannot be resolved through negotiations between 

Purchaser and the Unitholder Representative shall be taken to the Neutral
Arbitrator. All fees and expenses relating to the work performed by the
Neutral Arbitrator shall be allocated equally between the Unitholders (based
on their respective Pro Rata Shares on a several and not joint basis), on the
one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, with any such fees and expenses
due from the Unitholders to be paid out of the Escrow Amount. The
determination of the Neutral Arbitrator shall be binding on the Parties.

(c) Prior to the Escrow Termination Date and for so long as the remaining
Escrow Amount (reduced for any settled or pending Indemnification Claims)
exceeds the amount of the Tax at issue, the Unitholder Representative shall
have the right to control, at the expense of the Unitholders (based on their
respective Pro Rata Shares on a several and not joint basis, with any such
expenses due from the Unitholders to be paid out of the Escrow Amount), and
Purchaser shall have the right to participate in (at its own expense), any
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes and Tax Returns of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for which the Unitholders would be
obligated to indemnify Purchaser under this Agreement or that relate to a Tax
refund or credit for which the Unitholders are entitled to under this
Agreement (a "Pre-Closing Tax Contest"); provided, however, that the
Unitholder Representative shall not settle or compromise any such Pre-Closing
Tax Contest without Purchaser's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such settlement or compromise would have
the effect of increasing a Tax liability of the Company or its Subsidiaries
that is not indemnified by the Unitholders under this Agreement. Purchaser
shall provide the Unitholder Representative with prompt notice of any written
inquiries by a Taxing Authority relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Contest within
five (5) days of the receipt of such notice. If the Unitholder Representative
elects not to control such Pre-Closing Tax Contest (or if the Pre-Closing Tax
Contest arises after the Escrow Termination Date or at a time when the Tax at
issue exceeds the remaining Escrow Amount (reduced for any settled or pending
Indemnification Claims) then Purchaser shall control such matter, at the
expense of the Unitholders (based on their respective Pro Rata Shares on a
several and not joint basis, with any such expenses due from the Unitholders
to be paid out of the Escrow Amount), provided in such case that (x) the
Unitholder Representative shall have the right to participate in any such
matter (at the expense of the Unitholders (based on their respective Pro Rata
Shares on a several and not joint basis, with any such expenses due from the
Unitholders to be paid out of the Escrow Amount)) and (y) Purchaser shall keep
the Unitholder Representative reasonably informed of the details and status of
such matter (including providing the Unitholder Representative with copies of
all written correspondence regarding such matter). Purchaser shall not settle
any such proceedings without the written consent of the Unitholder
Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if
such settlement or compromise would have the effect of increasing a Tax
liability that the Unitholders are required to indemnify under this Agreement.

(d) The Unitholder Representative and Purchaser shall cooperate fully, as and
to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the
filing of any Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries, the filing and
prosecution of any Tax claims, and any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Such
cooperation shall include making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide assistance in the preparation of the Pre-Closing Tax Returns
and additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

(e) Without the prior written consent of the Unitholder Representative,
neither Purchaser, the Company nor any of their Affiliates shall make or
change any Tax election, adopt or change any accounting method, file any Tax
Return (including amended Tax Returns), surrender any right to claim a refund
of Taxes or take any other action outside the ordinary course of business, in
each case, if such election, adoption, change, amendment, surrender or action
could have the effect of increasing the Tax liability of the Unitholders or
any of their respective direct or indirect owners.

(f) For the portion of the Closing Date after the time of Closing, other than
transactions expressly contemplated hereby, Purchaser shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to carry on its business only in the ordinary course in
the same manner as heretofore conducted.

(g) To the extent permitted or required by applicable Law, the taxable year of
each of the Company and its Subsidiaries that includes the Closing Date shall
be treated as closing on (and including) the Closing Date. To the extent not
permitted or required by applicable Law, for all purposes of this Agreement,
in the case of any Straddle Period, the allocation of such Taxes to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date, except for property
Taxes, ad valorem Taxes and other similar Taxes calculated without regard to
income or receipts which shall be prorated on a daily basis.

6.6 Conduct of the Business Prior to the Closing. During the Pre-Closing
Period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (a) conduct
their respective businesses in the Ordinary Course of Business, except as
required by Law or as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (b)
use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact its business and all of
its material assets, franchises, licenses, operations and properties, keep
available the services of its current officers and significant employees and
independent contractors, and maintain its current relations and goodwill with
vendors, 

customer base, regulators, employees and other Persons having material
business relationships with the Company and/or its Subsidiaries. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the Pre-Closing Period,
except as consented to in writing by Purchaser (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take any action that would cause
any of the changes, events or conditions described in Section 3.5 to occur.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser is hereby deemed to consent to (i)
the Company's distribution of its equity and debt interests in MSLS Holdings
to Cobra Green or one or more Affiliates of Cobra Green at or prior to the
Closing in accordance with the steps set forth on Schedule 6.6 (the "MSLS
Distribution") and (ii) the Company's distribution of all cash and cash
equivalents of the Company and its Subsidiaries in excess of $2,500,000 in the
aggregate to the Unitholders at or prior to the Closing (it being understood
that any cash and cash equivalents (other than restricted cash) that is not so
distributed (including, for the avoidance of doubt, such $2,500,000) shall be
treated as a Current Asset for all purposes under this Agreement).

6.7 Pre-Closing Period Access to Information.

(a) Subject to Section 6.7(b), except as required pursuant to any
confidentiality agreement or similar Contract between the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and a third Person or pursuant to applicable Law (provided
that in such case the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to identify a
reasonable alternative to make such information available to Purchaser and its
representatives), during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will: (i) provide
Purchaser and its representatives (including any Person who is considering
providing financing to Purchaser to finance all or any portion of the
Enterprise Value that is subject to a written confidentiality agreement with
customary restrictions on use and disclosure of information with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, and their respective representatives) with
reasonable access, upon reasonable prior notice and during normal business
hours at mutually convenient times, to the officers, employees, agents and
accountants of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their assets and
properties and books and records; and (ii) furnish Purchaser and such other
Persons with all such information and data (including, without limitation,
copies of Contracts, Benefit Plans and other books and records) concerning the
business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Purchaser or
any of such other Persons reasonably may request in connection with such
investigation.

(b) Any such access and/or investigation by Purchaser and its representatives
shall not unreasonably interfere with any of the businesses or operations of
the Company or its Subsidiaries. Neither Purchaser nor any of its
representatives shall have any contact whatsoever, prior to the Closing Date,
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Transaction with
any agent, broker, partner, lessor, vendor, customer, supplier, employee or
consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except (i) for the
management team members with which it has been engaged in discussions and
diligence, and (ii) in consultation with the Company and then only with the
express prior written approval of the Company (not to be unreasonably
withheld). All requests by Purchaser for access or information shall be
submitted or directed exclusively to Raymond James and Associates, Inc., Messrs.
Bossidy, D'Urso, Kushel or Harris, or any other individual or individuals to
be designated in writing by the Company.

6.8 Post-Closing Preservation of Records. In order to facilitate the
resolution of any claims made against or incurred by the Company and/or any of
its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, or to the extent reasonably necessary
for tax, regulatory, contractual or other legitimate, noncompetitive purposes,
for a period of seven (7) years after the Closing, Purchaser shall:

(a) retain the books and records (including personnel files) of the Company
and its Subsidiaries relating to periods prior to the Closing in a manner
reasonably consistent with Purchaser's Record Management Policy and Records
Retention Schedule; and

(b) upon reasonable notice, afford the Unitholder Representative reasonable
access (including the right to make photocopies), during normal business
hours, to such books and records.

6.9 No Solicitation. From the date hereof until the earlier of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 2.3 or the Closing, each Unitholder and
the Company shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries and each
of their respective directors, officers, partners, controlled Affiliates,
members, managers, trustees, employees and agents and advisors to the extent
acting on behalf of such Unitholder, Company or Affiliate (all such parties,
collectively, the "Company Representatives") to, cease any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person other than Purchaser
with respect to, and to deal exclusively with Purchaser and its designated
Affiliates and representatives regarding, any and all acquisitions of, sales
of, and investments in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective businesses, securities or assets, whether by way of merger,
consolidation or other business combination with any other Person, purchase or
exchange of equity interests, purchase of assets or otherwise (an "Alternative
Transaction") and, without the prior consent of Purchaser, the Unitholders and
the Company shall not, and shall cause the Company's Subsidiaries and the
Company Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: 

(a) solicit, initiate, encourage or otherwise engage in any negotiations,
discussions or other communications with any other Person relating to any
Alternative Transaction;

(b) provide information or documentation to any other Person with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses
or assets in respect of any Alternative Transaction; or

(c) enter into any Contract with any other Person in respect of any
Alternative Transaction.

6.10 Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) Purchaser agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation by the Company and its Subsidiaries for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing now existing in favor of each
Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who
becomes prior to the Closing Date, an officer, director, or manager, as
applicable, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as provided in the
Governing Documents of the Company or such Subsidiary, in each case as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other Contract in
effect on the date hereof, shall survive the Closing and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms and shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years after
the Closing Date in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of such individuals for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Closing.

(b) The Company shall, at its own expense, obtain as of the Closing Date
"tail" insurance policies with a claims period of six (6) years from the
Closing Date with at least the same coverage and amounts, and containing terms
and conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors, officers and
managers of the Company and its Subsidiaries when compared to the insurance
maintained by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof, in each case, with respect to claims arising out of or relating to
events which occurred on or prior to the Closing Date (including in connection
with the Transaction). Alternatively, the Company may, at Cobra Green\'s
expense, arrange for the continuation of the same coverage and amounts, and
containing the same terms and conditions as is in force under the policy which
provides coverage to Cobra Green as of the Closing Date for the directors,
officers and managers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, but solely with
respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred on or
prior to the Closing Date (including in connection with the Transaction) and
the maintenance of such coverage for a period of six (6) years from the
Closing Date.

(c) The obligations of Purchaser and the Company under this Section 6.10 shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
director, officer or manager to whom this Section 6.10 applies without the
consent of such affected director, officer or manager (it being expressly
agreed that the directors, officers and managers to whom this Section 6.10
applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 6.10, each of whom
may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.10).

(d) In the event Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Purchaser, the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be,
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.10.

6.11 Employment and Benefit Matters. For the period commencing on the Closing
Date and ending on December 31, 2014, Purchaser agrees to maintain the
compensation and benefit levels, including base salary, annual cash incentive
opportunities, retirement benefits, and health and welfare benefits for the
employees of the Company (or any of the Company's Subsidiaries) who remain
employed after the Closing Date (the "Company Employees") at levels which are,
in the aggregate, at least comparable to those in effect for the Company
Employees immediately prior to the Closing. Purchaser will treat, and cause
the applicable benefit plans to treat, the service of the Company Employees
with the Company (or any Subsidiary of the Company) attributable to any period
before the Closing Date as service rendered to Purchaser or any Subsidiary of
Purchaser for purposes of eligibility and vesting under Purchaser's vacation
program, health or welfare plan(s) (other than short-term disability and life
insurance plans) maintained by Purchaser, and Purchaser's defined contribution
plans, except where credit would result in duplication of benefits. Without
limiting the foregoing, to the extent that any Company Employee participates
in any health or other group welfare benefit plan of Purchaser following the
Closing Date, (a) Purchaser shall cause any pre-existing conditions or
limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations
under any health or similar welfare plan of Purchaser to be waived with
respect to the Company Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent
waived under the corresponding plan in which the Company Employee participated
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (b) any deductibles paid by any
such Company Employee under any of the Company's or its Subsidiaries' health
plans in the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs shall be credited
towards deductibles under the health plans of Purchaser or any Subsidiary of
Purchaser. The provisions contained in this Section 6.11 are included for the
sole benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement, and shall not create
(i) any third-party beneficiary or other rights in any Company Employees,
employees, or independent contractors or their respective legal
representatives or beneficiaries or any other Person 

or (ii) any right to continued employment with the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or Purchaser. Nothing contained in this Section 6.11 is intended
to be or shall be considered to be an amendment or adoption of any Benefit
Plan, program, Contract, arrangement or policy of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or Purchaser nor shall it interfere with Purchaser's, Company's
or any of their respective Subsidiaries' right to amend, suspend or modify or
terminate any Benefit Plan or to terminate the employment of any employee or
service of any independent contractor of the Company or its Subsidiaries for
any reason.

6.12 Certain Waivers. Effective as of Closing, each Unitholder that is not a
Company Employee, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, releases and discharges any and all
claims as against Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, from and after the
Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) and/or the Company Employees, and
agrees not to sue, commence, prosecute or pursue, or cause to be commenced or
prosecuted, or voluntarily aid, any claim against Purchaser or its Affiliates
(including, from and after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries)
and/or the Company Employees, regardless of the jurisdiction in which such
claims arise; provided that each such Unitholder and its Affiliates, and each
of their respective successors and assigns retains, and does not release, such
Person's rights, if any, (a) to pursue any and all claims, actions or rights
that such Person may now or in future have solely on account of rights of such
Person under this Agreement or any other documents entered into in connection
therewith, (b) any other claim that may arise in the future based on events or
circumstances occurring after the Closing and (c) under this Section 6.12.

6.13 Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation.

(a) In order to induce Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, each
Unitholder, severally and not jointly, agrees that it will not, and will not
permit any of its controlled Affiliates or their respective directors,
officers, managers, employees employed by such Unitholder at such time and
agents and advisors to the extent acting on behalf of such Unitholder or
Affiliate to, directly or indirectly, in each case on its own behalf or for
the benefit of any other Person, other than on behalf of Purchaser or its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries):

(i) during the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the second
(2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, engage in, have an interest in or
otherwise be employed by (whether as an owner, operator, partner, member,
manager, employee, officer, director, consultant, advisor, lender,
representative or otherwise) any business or organization engaged in the
business of providing (A) residential loan review and due diligence services,
(B) oversight and monitoring of residential servicer and residential loan
performance or (C) REO-to-rental component and securitization services, in
each case, to unaffiliated third parties in exchange for fees (collectively,
the "Restricted Services"); provided that (x) ownership of less than five
percent (5%) of the outstanding stock of any publicly traded corporation, (y)
ownership of MSLS Holdings and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, but only
with respect to their activities relating to residential or commercial loan
servicing anywhere in Europe and (z) providing any of the Restricted Services
to any Affiliate of any investment fund managed by Greenfield Partners, LLC
for no consideration (other than management fees and/or the reimbursement of
out-of-pocket expenses) shall not be deemed to be violations of this Section
6.13(a)(i) solely by reason thereof;

(ii) during the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the second
(2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, (A) solicit any Person who is or was or
whose Affiliate is or was during the twelve (12) months preceding such
solicitation a customer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the
purpose of providing services competitive with those currently provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries; or (B) enter into or seek to enter into any
agreement with any such Person pursuant to which any such Unitholder or its
Affiliates would be engaged in providing services competitive with those

including in connection with any audit, and (ii) causing executives of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, to the extent reasonably required, to assist
with the preparation of customary materials for rating agency presentations,
offering documents, business projections and similar marketing documents in

Company and its Subsidiaries. Purchaser shall, from time to time, reimburse
the Company for any and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Company and its Subsidiaries (including reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel and accountants) in connection with its compliance with this Section
6.14(a), promptly upon receipt of the Company's written request therefor
together with reasonable documentation supporting such request.

(b) As may be reasonably requested by Purchaser from time to time, the Company

Credit Agreement or any related agreement (including the related pledge
agreement), to be effective upon the Closing, as reasonably requested by and
in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in writing by Purchaser
to the Company, and the Company shall, and the Unitholders shall cause the
Company to, consult with Purchaser before taking any action with respect to
any of the foregoing; provided that the Company shall not be obligated under
this sentence to take any action that would reasonably be expected to expose
the Company or its Subsidiaries to material liability or expenses if the
Closing fails to occur. Purchaser shall, from time to time, reimburse the
Company for any and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Company and its Subsidiaries (including reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel and accountants) in connection with its compliance with this Section

Subsidiaries identified by Purchaser in writing at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date to be repaid in connection with the Closing,

shall cause the Company to, use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver all
notices and take other actions required to facilitate the termination of
commitments in respect of such Indebtedness, repayment in full of all
obligations in respect of such Indebtedness and release of any Liens and
guarantees in connection therewith on the Closing Date and (ii) no later than
one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, or shall
have caused its Subsidiaries to, and the Unitholders shall cause the Company
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to Purchaser customary
payoff letters with respect to such Indebtedness (each, a "Payoff Letter") in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser from all financial
institutions and other Persons to which such Indebtedness is owed, or the
applicable agent, trustee or other representative on behalf of such Persons,
which Payoff Letters shall (A) indicate the total amount required to be paid
to fully satisfy all principal, interest, prepayment premiums, penalties,
breakage costs or other outstanding and unpaid obligations related to such
Indebtedness as of the Closing Date (the "Payoff Amount") and (B) state that
all obligations (including guarantees) in respect thereof and Liens in
connection therewith on the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

credit or similar Indebtedness.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the failure (in and of itself) to obtain
any amendment, waiver, consent, Payoff Letter or other deliverable under this
Section 6.14 shall in no way constitute a breach by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any Unitholder and (ii) any such failure shall not affect
Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement, including, without limitation,
its obligation to consummate the Closing as and when provided in Section 2.1.

covenant or agreement made by the Company in this Agreement;

(iii) any breach of any of the representations or warranties made by such
Unitholder in Article IV of this Agreement, in each case without giving effect
to any "Material Adverse Effect," "materiality" or Knowledge qualifications
contained in such representations and warranties for purposes of determining
whether a breach has occurred, at and as of the date of this Agreement and at
and as of the Closing Date as though made at and as of the Closing Date;

(iv) any breach of or failure to perform any covenant or agreement made by
such Unitholder in this Agreement;

(a) Subject to Section 8.4 and the other provisions of this Article VIII, from
and after the Closing Purchaser hereby agrees to reimburse, defend, indemnify
and hold each Unitholder, its Affiliates and each of their respective past,
present and future directors, officers, employees, stockholders, members and
partners, as applicable (collectively, the "Unitholder Indemnified Parties"),
harmless from and against any and all Losses actually incurred by a Unitholder
Indemnified Party based upon, arising out of or resulting from:

(i) any breach of any of the representations or warranties made by Purchaser
in this Agreement; or

(ii) any breach of or failure to perform any covenant or agreement made by
Purchaser in this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Escrow Termination
Date shall not apply to, and shall in no manner restrict or bar, any claims
brought by a Unitholder Indemnified Party following such date arising from or
relating to Purchaser's failure to satisfy any of its or the Company's post-
Closing payment obligations in this Agreement.



8.4 Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article VIII, (i) no Unitholder
shall have any indemnification obligations for Losses under Sections 8.2(a)(i)
and 8.2(a)(iii) unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Losses
actually incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under Sections
8.2(a)(i) and 8.2(a)(iii) exceeds Three Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand
dollars ($3,250,000) (the "Basket Amount"); provided, however, that from and
after such time as the total amount of Losses actually incurred by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties under Sections 8.2(a)(i) and 8.2(a)(iii) exceeds
the Basket Amount, then the Unitholders shall be liable only for the amount
that exceeds the Basket Amount, (ii) no Losses may be claimed by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties under Sections 8.2(a)(i) and 8.2(a)(iii) other than Losses
in excess of Fifteen Thousand dollars ($15,000) resulting from any single
claim or series of related claims arising out of the same or similar facts,
events or circumstances and (iii) in no event shall the aggregate
indemnification to be paid by the Unitholders pursuant to Sections 8.2(a)(i)
and 8.2(a)(iii) exceed Thirty Million dollars ($30,000,000) (the "Cap").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein but subject to the
following proviso, the limitations set forth in clauses (i) - (iii) above
shall not apply to any Losses based upon or resulting from any inaccuracy in
or breach of any Fundamental Representation made by the Company or any
Unitholder or any inaccuracy in or breach of the representations and
warranties contained in Section 3.13 (Taxes) or to any Losses arising from
fraud or Excluded Taxes; provided, however, that the aggregate liability of
any Unitholder pursuant to Sections 8.2(a)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) (other than
Sections 6.3, 6.12 and 6.13) or (v) of this Agreement shall under no
circumstances exceed the proceeds received by such Unitholder pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
term "severally and not jointly" as used in this Agreement means that each
Unitholder's liability for Losses will be limited as follows: (i) with respect
to indemnification claims made by a Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to
Section 8.2(a)(iii) or Section 8.2(a)(iv) against a particular Unitholder, the
breaching Unitholder will be solely liable for all such Losses (if any), and
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties will only be able to seek recourse for any
such claim against such breaching Unitholder (including by way of its
proportionate share of the Escrow Account), and (ii) with respect to
indemnification claims made by a Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to
Section 8.2(a)(i) or Section 8.2(a)(ii): (A) indemnification from the Escrow
Amount will be provided by funds deposited in the Escrow Account until the
balance of the Escrow Account is reduced to zero dollars ($0.00) and (B)
indemnification in excess of the Escrow Amount will be provided by each
Unitholder up to its Pro Rata Share of such Losses (if any), in each such
case, subject to the limitations in this Article VIII.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein
shall give rise to any right on the part of any Purchaser Indemnified Party or
any Unitholder Indemnified Party, after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(d) Any indemnification hereunder for Losses with respect to any Taxes
resulting from or arising in connection with any breach of or inaccuracy in
any representation or warranty with respect to Taxes (whether pursuant to the
definition of Excluded Taxes or otherwise) shall be limited to Taxes
attributable to Tax periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the
Closing Date, other than representations or warranties contained in Section
3.13(a)(vii), (viii) and (ix).

8.5 Indemnification Procedures. 

(a) In the event that indemnification may be sought under this Article VIII
(an "Indemnification Claim") in connection with (i) any action, suit or
proceeding that may be instituted or (ii) any claim that may be asserted, in
any such case, by any Person not a party to this Agreement, the Party seeking
indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnified Party") shall promptly cause
written notice of the assertion of such Indemnification Claim to be delivered
to the Party from whom indemnification hereunder is sought (the "Indemnifying
Party") prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in
Section 8.1; provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified
Party in giving any such notice shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
indemnification obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent
that) the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such delay. The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to be represented
by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal
with any Indemnification Claim and, if the Indemnifying Party elects to defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim,
it shall as promptly as practicable and within thirty (30) days (or sooner, if
the nature of the Indemnification Claim so requires) (the "Dispute Period")
notify the Indemnified Party of its intent to do so. Unless and until the
Indemnifying Party within the Dispute Period elects to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim, the
Indemnified Party may, subject to below, defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with such Indemnification Claim, and all legal and other
expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party shall be borne by the Indemnifying
Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Indemnification
Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate, at its own expense, in the
defense of such Indemnification Claim; provided, however, that such
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with
separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if (v) so requested
by the Indemnifying Party to participate, (w) in the reasonable opinion of
counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict or potential conflict exists
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such
separate representation advisable or if there are one or more legal defenses
or counterclaims available to it or to other Indemnified Parties which are
different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party, (x)
the claim involves the seeking of non-monetary relief which, if granted, could
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the business of the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, (y) the amount of potential damages
exceeds two hundred percent (200%) of the amount that is available for
indemnification hereunder, after taking into account all other claims made or
reasonably anticipated, or (z) the Indemnifying Party ceases to diligently
defend the Indemnification Claim; provided, further, however, that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay for more than one (1) such
counsel for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any single
Indemnification Claim, other than local counsel. In the event of any of (w) -
(z) in the preceding sentence, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
take over the defense of the applicable Indemnification Claim. The Parties
hereto agree to reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with the
defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Indemnification Claim, and the
party in charge of the defense, negotiation or settlement shall keep the other
parties reasonably apprised at all times as to the status thereof.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.5 to the contrary, neither the
Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall, without the written
consent of the other Party, settle or compromise any Indemnification Claim or
permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment unless the claimant and
such Party provide to such other Party an unqualified release from all
liability in respect of the Indemnification Claim and such settlement,
compromise or judgment does not involve any non-monetary penalty or admission
of fault or liability on the part of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates.

(b) In the event that an Indemnified Party has any claim against an
Indemnifying Party hereunder, but which such claim does not involve an action,
suit, proceeding or claim by a third party not party to this Agreement, which
such Indemnified Party determines to assert, then such Indemnified Party shall
assert such Indemnification Claim by sending written notice to the
Indemnifying Party describing in reasonable detail the nature of such claim
and, if then available, the Indemnified Party's estimate of the amount of
Losses attributable to such claim (which estimate shall not otherwise affect
the Indemnifying Party's obligations under this Article VIII).

(c) Within five (5) Business Days after any final and non-appealable decision,
judgment or award shall have been rendered by any Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction, or a settlement or arbitration shall have been
consummated, or the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall have
arrived at a mutually binding agreement (any such event, a "Final
Determination") with respect to any Indemnification Claim hereunder, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay any amount so determined to the Indemnified
Party.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the foregoing
provisions of this Section 8.5 shall not apply to Tax matters, which instead
shall be governed by Section 6.5(c).

8.6 Calculation of Losses.

(a) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Article VIII shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified
Party under third-party insurance policies or otherwise with respect to such
Losses, net of any deductible or any other expense incurred by the Indemnified
Party in obtaining such recovery. 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no
party shall, in any event, be liable to any other Person for any Losses
pursuant to this Article VIII to the extent such Losses constitute punitive
damages, except to the extent resulting from a settlement or court award in
connection with a claim or action brought by a third party.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, (i)
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are not entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this Article VIII to the extent that any matter, amount, item or other fact
for which they are seeking indemnification hereunder was included as a Current
Liability in determining the Closing Date Net Working Capital Amount, and (ii)
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties' rights to indemnification pursuant to this
Article VIII on account of any Losses will be reduced by the amount of any
reserve reflected on the Company's consolidated books and records as of the
Closing Date established for the general category of items or matters similar
in nature to the specific items or matters giving rise to such Loss.

8.7 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. The Parties agree to treat any
indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article VIII as an adjustment to the
purchase price for federal, state, local and foreign income Tax purposes,
except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

8.8 Subrogation. Upon making any payment for Losses of an Indemnified Party
under this Article VIII, the Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such
payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party against any
third party with respect to the Loss for which the payment relates. In
addition to any other obligation under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party
agrees to duly execute and deliver, upon request of the Indemnifying Party,
all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the subrogation
and subordination rights granted pursuant to this Section 8.8.

8.9 Exclusive Remedy.

(a) The Parties agree that after the Closing, except in the case of actual
fraud (in which case a claim for actual fraud may be asserted solely against
the Person (or its Affiliate(s)) who committed such actual fraud, and no other
Person shall be liable for the actual fraud committed by such Person) or with
respect to matters for which the remedy of specific performance, injunctive
relief or other non-monetary equitable remedies are available, the exclusive
remedies of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the Unitholder Indemnified
Parties for any Losses based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of
the matters set forth in this Agreement are the remedies set forth in Section
6.5 and the indemnification obligations of the Parties set forth in this
Article VIII.

(b) Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that prior to the Closing, except
in the case of actual fraud (in which case a claim for actual fraud may be
asserted solely against the Person (or its Affiliate) who committed such
actual fraud, and no other Person shall be liable for the actual fraud
committed by such Person), Purchaser shall have no right or remedy to take any
action in respect of, and the Company and the Unitholders shall have no
liability to Purchaser in respect of, any breach by the Company or any
Unitholder, as applicable, of any representations or warranties contained
herein or any failure to comply with any of the covenants, conditions or
agreements contained herein, except (i) to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 2.3 hereof, in which event, the Company and the Unitholders shall
thereupon only have liability with respect thereto as provided for in Section
2.5 or (ii) to seek specific performance pursuant to Section 9.13 for
injunctive relief.

9.3 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to "Sections,"
or "Exhibits," such reference shall be to a section of, or an exhibit of, this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to "Schedule," such reference shall be to a section of the
Disclosure Schedules unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The terms defined in the singular have a comparable meaning when
used in the plural, and vice versa, and references herein to any gender
includes each other gender. The term "director" and "manager" shall be used
interchangeably and shall mean a member of an entity's board of directors,
board of managers or similar body. The Company and the Unitholders may, at
their option, include in the Disclosure Schedule items that are not material
in order to avoid any misunderstanding, and such inclusion, or any references
to dollar amounts, shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgement or
representation that such items are material, to establish any standard of
materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of
this Agreement. Information disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule shall
constitute a disclosure for, and only for, the corresponding Section or
subsection of this Agreement and for any other Section or subsection of this
Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure that such disclosure is relevant to such other Section or
subsection.

9.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic transmission), all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and
delivered to the other Parties.

9.5 Entire Agreement; Construction. This Agreement (including the Disclosure
Schedules, schedules, annexes and exhibits hereto and the other agreements and
instruments referred to herein) constitute the entire agreement and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. The Parties
have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party
by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. 

9.6 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by Purchaser and the Unitholder Representative.

the time for the performance of any of its obligations or other acts; (b)
waive any inaccuracies in its representations and warranties contained herein
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or (c) waive compliance with any
of its agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver
shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party
against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any Party
in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
power or privilege.

9.8 Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial. Pursuant to Section 5-1401 of the
General Obligations Law of the State of New York, the Parties hereby agree
that all issues and questions concerning the construction, validity,
enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement and the Schedules and
Exhibits hereto shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice of law or
principles of conflict of law, rules or provisions (whether of the State of
New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York. In furtherance of
the foregoing, the internal law of the State of New York shall control the
interpretation and construction of this Agreement (and all schedules and
exhibits hereto), even though under that jurisdiction's choice of law or
conflict of law analysis, the substantive law of some other jurisdiction would
ordinarily apply. In reference to Section 5-1401 of the General Obligations
Law of the State of New York, the Parties hereby agree that this Agreement
involves more than $250,000. All legal proceedings arising out of or relating
to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in any New York
federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of the City of New York;
provided, however, that if such federal court does not have jurisdiction over
such legal proceeding, such legal proceeding shall be heard and determined
exclusively in any New York state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of
the City of New York. Consistent with the preceding sentence, the Parties
hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state
court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of the City of New York for the
purpose of any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
brought by any party hereto; (b) agree that service of process will be validly
effected by sending notice in accordance with Section 9.2; and (c) irrevocably
waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any
such legal proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that the legal proceeding is brought
in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the legal proceeding is improper,
or that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may
not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts. EACH PARTY HERETO
HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT.

9.9 Unitholder Representative.

(a) Each Unitholder hereby grants the Unitholder Representative full power and
authority (but not the obligation) to take all actions under this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement that are to be taken by the Unitholder
Representative. Each Unitholder hereby authorizes the Unitholder
Representative to take any and all actions on behalf of the Unitholders which
the Unitholder Representative believes are necessary or appropriate under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, including, without limitation, executing
the Escrow Agreement as the Unitholder Representative, giving and receiving
any notice or instruction permitted or required under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement by the Unitholder Representative, interpreting all of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, authorizing

connection with the foregoing matters. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each Unitholder hereby grants the Unitholder Representative full
power and authority to interpret all the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and to consent to any amendment hereof or
thereof in its capacity as the Unitholder Representative, in each case on
behalf of the Unitholders.

(b) Each Unitholder hereby grants the Unitholder Representative the authority
(but not the obligation), in each case on behalf of the Unitholders, to: 

(i) Receive all notices or documents given or to be given to Unitholder
Representative pursuant hereto or to the Escrow Agreement or in connection
herewith or therewith and to receive and accept services of legal process in
connection with any suit or proceeding arising under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement;

(ii) Engage counsel, and such accountants and other advisors and incur such
other expenses in connection with this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby as the Unitholder
Representative may in its sole discretion deem appropriate; and

(iii) At and after the Closing, take such action as the Unitholder
Representative may in its sole discretion deem appropriate in respect of: (A)
waiving any inaccuracies in the representations or warranties of Purchaser, or
any breach of a covenant or agreement by Purchaser, in each case contained in
this Agreement or in any document delivered by Purchaser pursuant hereto; (B)
taking such other action as the Unitholder Representative is authorized to
take under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; (C) receiving all documents
or certificates and making all determinations, in its capacity as the

and/or settlement of any claims for which indemnification or payment is sought
pursuant to Section 1.5 or Article VIII and any waiver of any obligation of
Purchaser.

(c) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, each Unitholder
hereby agrees that the Unitholder Representative shall have no duties to the
Unitholders or have any liability to the Unitholders with respect to any
action taken, decision made or instruction given by the Unitholder
Representative in connection with the Escrow Agreement or this Agreement.

(d) Each Unitholder agrees to indemnify the Unitholder Representative for and
shall hold the Unitholder Representative harmless against any loss, liability,
fee or expense (including legal, accounting and other advisors' fees and
expenses, if applicable) incurred by the Unitholder Representative or any of
its Affiliates and any of their respective partners, directors, officers,
employees, agents, stockholders, consultants, attorneys, accountants,
advisors, brokers, representatives or controlling persons, in each case
relating to the Unitholder Representative's conduct as the Unitholder
Representative, other than losses, liabilities or expenses resulting from the
Unitholder Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct in
connection with its performance under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
This indemnification shall survive the termination of this Agreement. The
costs of such indemnification (including the costs and expenses of enforcing
this right of indemnification) shall be individual obligations of the
Unitholders in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares of such costs.
Each Unitholder hereby agrees that the Unitholder Representative may, in all
questions arising under this Agreement, rely on the advice of counsel and for
anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the Unitholder
Representative in accordance with such advice, the Unitholder Representative
shall not be liable to the Unitholders or the Escrow Agent or any other
Person. Each Unitholder hereby agrees that in no event shall the Unitholder
Representative be liable hereunder or in connection herewith for (i) any
indirect, punitive, special or consequential damages or (ii) any other amounts
that may become due and payable by any Unitholder hereunder.

(e) Each Unitholder agrees that in the performance of its duties hereunder,
the Unitholder Representative shall be entitled to (i) rely upon any document
or instrument reasonably believed to be genuine, accurate as to content and
signed by any Unitholder or any Party hereunder and (ii) assume that any
Person purporting to give any notice in accordance with the provisions hereof
has been duly authorized to do so.

(f) Each Unitholder hereby authorizes the Unitholder Representative, in its
sole discretion, to comply with final, nonappealable orders or decisions
issued or process entered by any court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator
with respect to the Escrow Fund. If any portion of the Escrow Fund is
disbursed to the Unitholder Representative and is at any time attached,
garnished or levied upon under any court order, or in case the payment,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property shall be
stayed or enjoined by any court order, or in case any order, judgment or
decree shall be made or entered by any court affecting such property or any
part thereof, then and in any such event, each Unitholder hereby authorizes
the Unitholder Representative, in its sole discretion, but in good faith, to
rely upon and comply with any such order, writ, judgment or decree which it is
advised by legal counsel selected by it is binding upon it without the need
for appeal or other action; and if the Unitholder Representative complies with
any such order, writ, judgment or decree, each Unitholder hereby agrees that
it shall not be liable to any Unitholder or to any other Person by reason of
such compliance even though such order, writ, judgment or decree may be
subsequently reversed, modified, annulled set aside or vacated.

(g) Each Unitholder hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Unitholder
Representative as such Unitholder's true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent
and authorizes him to act for such Unitholder and in such Unitholder's name,
place and stead, in any and all capacities to do and perform every act and
thing required or permitted to be done in connection with this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement, as fully to all intents and purposes as such Unitholder
might or 

could do in person, including taking any and all action on behalf of such
Unitholder from time to time as contemplated hereunder and thereunder. Any
delivery by the Unitholder Representative of any waiver, amendment, agreement,
opinion, certificate or other document executed by the Unitholder
Representative will bind each Unitholder by such documents or action as fully
as if such Unitholder had executed and delivered such documents. This
appointment and power of attorney shall be deemed an agency coupled with an
interest and all authority conferred hereby shall be irrevocable and shall not
be subject to termination by operation of law, whether by the death or
incapacity of any Unitholder or the occurrence of any other event or events.
Such appointment shall be binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators,
estates, personal representatives, officers, directors, security holders,
successors and assigns of each such Unitholder. All decisions of the
Unitholder Representative shall be final and binding on all of the Unitholder,
and no such Unitholders shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same. Purchaser shall be entitled to rely upon, without
independent investigation, any act, notice, instruction or communication from
the Unitholder Representative and any document executed by the Unitholder
Representative on behalf of any Unitholders and shall be fully protected in
connection with any action or inaction taken or omitted to be taken in
reliance thereon, absent willful misconduct.

9.10 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

9.11 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties hereto (whether
by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of
Purchaser and the Unitholder Representative; provided, however, that Purchaser
may assign any of its rights (but not its obligations) under this Agreement to
a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective, heirs, successors
and permitted assigns.

9.12 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise specifically set forth
herein (including, without limitation, Sections 1.3(b), 1.5(e)(ii), 6.10(c)
and Article VIII), this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties
hereto and their permitted assigns, and nothing herein expressed or implied
shall give or be construed to give any Person, other than the Parties hereto
and such permitted assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder. All
references herein to the enforceability of agreements with third parties, the
existence or non-existence of third party rights, the absence of breaches or
defaults by third parties, or similar matters or statements, are intended only
to allocate rights and risks among the Parties hereto and are not intended to
be admissions against interests, give rise to any inference or proof of
accuracy, be admissible against any Party hereto by any third party, or give
rise to any claim or benefit to any third party.

9.13 Enforcement of Agreement. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement was not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It
is accordingly agreed that the parties will be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof without bond or other security being required,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
hereunder, at law or in equity. Subject to the other terms of this Agreement
and except as expressly provided in this Agreement, no right or remedy under
this Agreement shall limit the exercise or applicability of any other right or
remedy under this Agreement.

9.14 Waiver of Conflicts; Privilege.

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that Goodwin Procter LLP
("Goodwin") has acted as counsel to the Company and its Subsidiaries, the
Unitholder Representative and each of the Unitholders in connection with the
negotiation of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(b) Purchaser hereby consents and agrees to, and from and after the Closing
agrees to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to consent and agree to,
Goodwin representing the Unitholder Representative and/or any of the
Unitholders (collectively, the "Unitholder Parties") after the Closing in any
dispute in which the interests of the Unitholder Parties may be directly
adverse to Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) that either is existing on the date hereof or arises in the
future and relates to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
even though Goodwin may have represented the Company or its Subsidiaries in a
matter substantially related to any such dispute, or may be handling ongoing
matters for the Company or its Subsidiaries. Purchaser further consents and
agrees to, and from and after the Closing agrees to cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to consent and agree to, the communication by Goodwin to the
Unitholder Parties in connection with any such representation of any fact
known to Goodwin arising by reason of Goodwin's prior representation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. 

(c) In connection with the foregoing, Purchaser hereby irrevocably waives and
agrees not to assert, and from and after the Closing agrees to cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to irrevocably waive and not to assert, any
conflict of interest arising from or in connection with (i) Goodwin's prior
representation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) Goodwin's
representation of the Unitholder Representative and the Unitholders prior to
and after the Closing.

(d) Purchaser further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing, on
behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, that as to all communications in
any form or format whatsoever between or among Goodwin, on the one hand, and
the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Unitholder Representative and/or any
Unitholder, or any of their respective directors, officers employees or other
representatives, on the other hand, that relate in any way to the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any dispute arising under this Agreement (collectively, the
"Privileged Communications"), the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence relating thereto belong solely to the
Unitholder Representative and the Unitholders and shall be controlled by the
Unitholder Representative on behalf of the Unitholders and shall not pass to
or be claimed by Purchaser, the Company or any of the its Subsidiaries.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and a third party
other than the Unitholder Representative or a Unitholder, on the other hand
(any such dispute, a "Third Party Claim"), Purchaser, the Company or its
Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent the
disclosure of the Privileged Communications to such third party or waive such
privilege if desired in connection with resolving such Third Party Claim. In
the event that Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries is legally required
or requested by Order or otherwise (any such request or Order, a "Legal
Request") to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Privileged
Communications, Purchaser shall be entitled to access or obtain a copy of and
disclose the Privileged Communications to the extent necessary to comply with
any such Legal Request. In the event of any Legal Request, Purchaser shall
promptly notify the Unitholder Representative in writing (prior to the
disclosure by Purchaser of any Privileged Communications to the extent
practicable) so that the Unitholder Representative can seek a protective order
and Purchaser agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts (at the sole
cost and expense of the Unitholder Representative) to assist therewith.

(f) To the extent that files or other materials maintained by Goodwin
constitute property of its clients, only the Unitholder Representative and the
Unitholders shall hold such property rights and Goodwin shall have no duty to
reveal or disclose any such files or other materials or any Privileged
Communications to Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between Goodwin, on the one hand, and the Company
or its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, except that the foregoing limitations
shall not apply in connection with any Third Party Claim or Legal Request.

(g) Purchaser agrees that it will not, and that it will cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries not to, (i) access or use the Privileged Communications,
including by way of review of any electronic data, communications or other
information, or by seeking to have the Unitholder Representative or any
Unitholder waive the attorney-client or other privilege, or by otherwise
asserting that Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has the right
to waive the attorney-client or other privilege or (ii) seek to obtain the
Privileged Communications from Goodwin; provided that (A) the foregoing
limitations shall not apply in connection with any Third Party Claim or Legal
Request, (B) in no event shall Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries have
any liability to the Unitholder Representative or any Unitholder in respect of
any inadvertent access to such communications, nor shall Purchaser, the
Company or its Subsidiaries have any duty to notify the Unitholder
Representative or any Unitholder of any such inadvertent access, (C) none of
Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries shall have any duty to segregate
any such communications from the other books and records, databases or other
data storage media of any kind whatsoever of Purchaser, the Company or its
Subsidiaries and (D) in the event that segregation and/or retrieval of such
communications becomes necessary or desirable, then the Unitholders shall bear
the costs of such segregation and/or retrieval (including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel related thereto).
