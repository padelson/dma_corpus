(a) For purposes of this Agreement, including the determination of the

Section 2.3.

(b) Closing Date Purchase Price Adjustment.

(i) Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller

to the establishment of reserves) shall govern and be treated as the
applicable Accounting Principles.

(c) As promptly as practicable, but no later than ninety (90) days after the

(either such period, the "Review Period") Seller and its accountants shall be
provided access at all reasonable times to the Company's personnel, books and
records for the purpose of reviewing the Buyer Closing Certificate or
preparing the Seller Closing Certificate, as applicable. On or prior to the
last day of the Review Period, Seller may deliver either (i) if Seller
disagrees in any respect with any item or amount shown or reflected in the
Buyer Closing Certificate or with the calculation of the Final Purchase Price
or any of the Purchase Price Elements, a notice to Buyer setting forth, in
reasonable detail, each disputed item or amount and the basis for Seller's
disagreement therewith or (ii) if so elected by Seller in accordance with
Section 2.3(c), the Seller Closing Certificate (either such notice or
certificate, the "Dispute Notice"). The Dispute Notice shall set forth
Seller's position as to the proper calculation of the Final Purchase Price and
each of the Purchase Price Elements (to the extent in dispute by Seller). If
no Dispute Notice is received by Buyer by the expiry of the Review Period and
Buyer previously delivered a Buyer Closing Certificate pursuant to this
Agreement, the Buyer Closing Certificate shall be deemed to be accepted in
whole by Seller, whereupon (1) the Final Purchase Price reflected on the Buyer
Closing Certificate shall be deemed to be the "Final Purchase Price," and (2)
Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, will pay to the other Party the amount
owing in accordance with Section 2.3(g) hereof. In the event that Seller
timely delivers a Dispute Notice to Buyer, Buyer or Seller, as the case may
be, will pay to the other Party any undisputed portion of the amount
determined under Section 2.3(c) hereof which would be payable regardless of
how the matters set forth in the Dispute Notice are resolved (the "Undisputed
Amount").

(e) For twenty (20) days after Buyer's receipt of a Dispute Notice, if any,
the Parties shall endeavor in good faith to resolve by mutual agreement all
matters in the Dispute Notice. In the event that the Parties are unable to
resolve by mutual agreement any matter in the Dispute Notice within such
20-day period, Buyer and Seller hereby agree that they shall engage KPMG LLP
(the "Independent Accounting Firm") in respect of this Section 2.3 and
promptly execute a reasonable and customary engagement letter with the
Independent Accounting Firm, if requested to do so by the Independent
Accounting Firm. Seller and Buyer shall submit the disputed matters, as
described in the Dispute Notice, together with such arguments as either of
them choose to make in connection therewith, in writing to the Independent
Accounting Firm within twenty (20) days after the Independent Accounting
Firm's engagement.

(f) Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Independent Accounting Firm to resolve the disputed matters based upon the
materials submitted to it pursuant to the last sentence of Section 2.3(e)
hereof within thirty (30) days following the submission of such materials. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall



determine, based solely on presentations by Seller and Buyer, and not by
independent review, only those issues in dispute specifically set forth in the
Dispute Notice and shall render a written report to Seller and Buyer (the
"Adjustment Report") in which the Independent Accounting Firm shall, after
considering all matters set forth in the Dispute Notice, determine what
adjustments, if any, should be made to the Buyer Closing Certificate or Seller
Closing Certificate, as applicable, solely as to the disputed items and shall
determine the appropriate Final Purchase Price on that basis. The Adjustment
Report shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the Independent Accounting
Firm's determination with respect to each of the disputed items or amounts
specified in the Dispute Notice, and the revisions, if any, to be made to the
Buyer Closing Certificate or Seller Closing Certificate, as applicable, and
the Final Purchase Price, together with supporting calculations. In resolving
any disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm: (i) shall be bound to the
principles of this Section 2.3, (ii) shall limit its review to matters
specifically set forth in the Dispute Notice, (iii) shall limit its review to
correcting mathematical errors and determining whether disputed items were
determined in accordance with Accounting Principles and this Agreement and
shall not make any other determination, including any determination as to
whether any of the Purchase Price Elements or any estimates on the Estimated
Closing Statement are correct, adequate or sufficient and (iv) shall not
assign a value to any item higher than the highest value for such item claimed
by either Party or lower than the lowest value for such item claimed by either
Party; provided, however, that to the extent the determination of the value of
any disputed item affects any other item used in calculating the Final
Purchase Price or any of the Purchase Price Elements, such effect may be taken
into account by the Independent Accounting Firm. All fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be split equally by Buyer and Seller. The
Adjustment Report, absent fraud, shall be final and binding upon Buyer and
Seller, shall be deemed a final arbitration award that is binding on each of
Buyer and Seller, and no Party shall seek further recourse to courts, other
tribunals or otherwise, other than to enforce the Adjustment Report. Judgment
may be entered to enforce the Adjustment Report in any court having proper
jurisdiction in accordance herewith. Upon the issuance of the Adjustment
Report the Final Purchase Price reflected in the Adjustment Report shall be
deemed to be the "Final Purchase Price," and Buyer or Seller, as the case may
be, will pay to the other Party the amount owing in accordance with Section
2.3(g).

(g) Effective upon the end of the Review Period (if a timely Dispute Notice is
not delivered), or upon the resolution of all matters set forth in the Dispute
Notice by mutual agreement of the Parties or by the issuance of the Adjustment
Report (if a timely Dispute Notice is delivered), (i) if the Final Purchase
Price is greater than the Closing Purchase Price, Buyer shall promptly, but no
later than ten (10) Business Days after such final determination, pay to
Seller the amount of such difference, and (ii) if Final Purchase Price is less
than the Closing Purchase Price, Seller shall promptly, but no later than ten
(10) Business Days after such final determination, pay to Buyer the amount of
such difference. Any such payment shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by Buyer or
Seller, as the case may be, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
applicable payment date, and, in the absence of any such designation, by
certified check mailed to such Party at such Party's notice address.



(h) The Parties agree that the purpose of calculating Closing Net Working
Capital and the related adjustments to the Closing Purchase Price is to
measure any change in Net Working Capital, and this Section 2.3 is not
intended to, and the calculation of the Final Purchase Price shall not,
introduce different judgments, accounting methodologies (including with
respect to accruals and reserves), policies, principals, practices, procedures
or classifications than the Accounting Principles, or to adjust for any
inconsistencies between Accounting Principles, on the one hand, and GAAP, on
the other (solely to the extent such inconsistencies are reflected on the face
of the Accounting Principles).

Section 2.4 Volumetric Gas Imbalance Amount. Seller and Buyer agree as
follows:

(a) Buyer shall deliver a copy of each report of volumetric natural gas
imbalances (a "Volumetric Gas Imbalance Report") for each of the LDCs or
pipelines with whom the Company has agreements for the delivery or
transportation of natural gas as of the Closing Date to Seller within twenty
(20) Business Days following Buyer's receipt of the Volumetric Gas Imbalance
Report from such LDC or pipeline to the extent such report covers any portion
of the year ending December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2020. Buyer and Seller
shall instruct each LDC or pipeline to, based on the Closing Date, calculate
Seller's Volumetric Gas Imbalance Report separate and apart from Buyer's
Volumetric Gas Imbalance Report in each Volumetric Gas Imbalance Report. In
respect of the period ending on the Closing Date, the volumetric natural gas
imbalances attributable to such period and pertaining to each such LDC or
pipeline multiplied by the applicable index price for natural gas set forth in
the tariff or contract with such LDC or pipeline (or, if the tariff or
contract does not specify an index price, the applicable index price for the
applicable market) shall be for the account of Seller (the "Seller's Imbalance
Amount"), subject to reduction for imbalance amounts set forth as a current
liability in Net Working Capital (as adjusted finally pursuant to Section
2.3). All volumetric natural gas imbalances pertaining to each such LDC and
pipeline for the period beginning after the Closing Date shall be for the
account of Buyer. Promptly following receipt of the Volumetric Gas Imbalance
Report, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement showing Seller's Imbalance
Amount attributable to such report.

(b) If Seller disagrees with a Seller's Imbalance Amount, Seller shall, within
ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such statement, deliver a notice to
Buyer disagreeing with Seller's Imbalance Amount and setting forth Seller's
calculation of Seller's Imbalance Amount. Upon Buyer's receipt of such notice
of disagreement, Buyer and Seller shall, during the fifteen (15) days
following such delivery, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach
agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine Seller's
Imbalance Amount and the calculation thereof.

(c) Within five (5) Business Days following determination of Seller's
Imbalance Amount (including if Seller does not deliver a notice of
disagreement within ten (10) Business Days pursuant to Section 2.4(b)), if (A)
such amount is positive, Buyer shall remit Seller's Imbalance Amount to Seller
and (B) if such amount is negative, Seller shall remit Seller's Imbalance
Amount to Buyer, in each case by wire transfer of immediately available funds
into an account designated by the receiving Party.



Section 2.5 Payments and Charges. Each Party agrees that if any Party
("Receiving Party") receives any payment that under the terms and provisions
of this Agreement should have been paid to the other Party, the Receiving
Party shall remit such payment to the other Party as soon as reasonably
practicable after its receipt. Each Party agrees that if any Party ("Paying
Party") inadvertently pays any expense or charge that should have been paid by
the other Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Paying Party can
invoice the other party for such amount, such invoice to provide sufficient
supporting documentation to permit the other Party to verify the
appropriateness of the charge and that such charge should be paid by such
other Party, and the other Party shall, if appropriate, remit to the Paying
Party such amount as soon as reasonably practicable after its receipt of such
invoice.

Section 2.6 Tax Treatment. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i)
following the Conversion, the Company will be classified as a disregarded
entity under Section 301.7701-3(b) of the Treasury Regulations and (ii) the
sale and purchase contemplated by this Agreement and by the other Transaction
Documents is properly characterized for U.S. federal and applicable state
income Tax purposes as a sale by Seller to Buyer of the assets of the Company.
The Parties shall (and shall cause their Affiliates to) report on their Tax
Returns in a manner consistent therewith to the greatest extent permitted by
Applicable Law.

Section 2.7 Withholding. Upon written notice to Seller, Buyer and any other
Person making payments on its behalf shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration or other amounts otherwise payable or deliverable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts (if any) as are required to be
deducted or withheld under the Code or any other Applicable Law. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted or withheld (and paid to the applicable Taxing
Authority), such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made.

provider of the Company. Each Participant has satisfied all conditions for
receiving any early retirement subsidies under any Company Plan. No Tax
penalties or additional Taxes have been imposed or would be reasonably
expected to be imposed on any Participant, and no acceleration of Taxes has

compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.

(g) Except as set forth in Section 3.19(g) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither

benefits otherwise payable to any Participant; (iii) result in any
acceleration of the time of payment, funding or vesting of any such benefits
to any Participant; or (iv) result in any payment or benefit that would
constitute an "excess parachute payment" under Code Section 280G. No

material to the Business. Except as set forth on Section 3.20(d) of the
Disclosure Schedule, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the Transition Services Agreement and the consummation of the transactions

new or additional requirements with respect to the Company's use or
exploitation of, any right of the Company in any Intellectual Property that is

result in the creation of any Encumbrance (other than a Permitted Encumbrance)
on any of the assets or properties of Buyer pursuant to, any Contract or
Governmental Approval to which Buyer is a party or by which any of such assets
or properties is bound or affected except, in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii), for such violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 4.3 Enforceability. This Agreement is, and each of the other Buyer
Documents when executed and delivered will be, the legal, valid and binding
obligation of Buyer, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms,
except that such enforceability may be limited by (a) applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Applicable Laws affecting
creditors' rights generally, and (b) equitable principles which may limit the
availability of certain equitable remedies in certain instances.

Section 4.4 Consents. No authorization, approval or consent of, or filing with
or notification to, any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or
given by Buyer or its Affiliates in connection with the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement and the other Buyer Documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except (a)
for any filings required to be made under the HSR Act, (b) for such approvals,
notices or filings as may be required by any applicable federal or state
securities laws or (c) where failure to obtain such authorization, approval or
consent, or to make such filing or notification, would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.

Section 4.5 Litigation. There are no Actions pending or, to Buyer's knowledge,
threatened against Buyer that would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 4.6 Financial Advisors. Neither Buyer nor any Person acting on its
behalf has entered (directly or indirectly) into any agreement with any Person
that would obligate, or would purport to obligate, Seller to pay any
commission, broker's fee, or finder's or other fee in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents.

Section 4.7 Sufficient Financing. Buyer has delivered to Seller true, complete
and correct copies of (a) an executed equity commitment letter (the "Equity
Commitment Letter"), dated as of the date hereof, by and between the Investors
named therein (collectively, "Equity Sponsor") and Buyer pursuant to which
Equity Sponsor has, among other things, and subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, committed to provide the amount set forth therein to Buyer
in connection with the Closing (the "Equity Financing", and together with the
Debt Financings, the "Financing"), (b) the ABL Commitment Letter, pursuant to
which the ABL Financing Sources party thereto have committed to provide the
ABL Financing to Buyer, (c) the Shell Commitment Letter (together with the
Equity Commitment Letter and the ABL Commitment Letter, the "Commitment
Letters"), pursuant to which the Shell Financing Sources party thereto have
committed to provide the Shell Financing to Buyer, and (d) the fee letter
related to the ABL Commitment Letter with only fee and certain other economic
and "flex" terms redacted (as the same may be amended or modified to the



extent permitted hereunder, the "Redacted Fee Letter"). Assuming the Financing
is funded in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Commitment
Letters (including after giving effect to any "flex" provisions in the
Redacted Fee Letter), the aggregate proceeds to be disbursed pursuant to the
Commitment Letters, are sufficient as of the Closing Date to allow Buyer to
consummate the Closing (including with respect to the payment of the Closing
Purchase Price in accordance with Section 2.2), to provide credit support to
certain of the Company's counterparties, to pay related fees and expenses and
to make all other payments contemplated herein to be made by Buyer at the
Closing (collectively, the "Financing Purposes"). As of the date of this
Agreement, each Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is the valid
and binding obligation of Buyer and, to Buyer's knowledge, the other parties
thereto, subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
moratorium or other similar Applicable Laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and general principles of equitable relief. As of the date of this
Agreement, no Commitment Letter has been amended or otherwise modified in any
respect. Except for any customary non-disclosure agreements that do not impact
the conditionality, enforceability, availability or aggregate amount of the
Debt Financings, as of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other
contractual obligations or arrangements that could affect the availability of
the Debt Financings, other than as expressly set forth in each Debt Commitment
Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that would
constitute a default or breach under either Debt Commitment Letter on the part
of Buyer, or, to the Buyer's knowledge, the other parties thereto. As of the
date of this Agreement, the commitment contained in each Debt Commitment
Letter has not been terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect
and no such termination, reduction, withdrawal or rescission is contemplated
by Buyer or, to Buyer's knowledge, the other parties thereto. Buyer has paid
in full any and all commitment fees or other fees, costs and expenses and
amounts in connection with each Debt Commitment Letter that are payable on or
prior to the date of this Agreement. There are no conditions precedent or
other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount (or any portion)
of the Debt Financings, including any condition or other contingency relating
to the availability of the Debt Financings pursuant to any "flex" provision,
other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters or the
Redacted Fee Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, and assuming
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions in Section 5.2, and assuming no
material breach by Seller and the Company of their respective representations
and warranties and obligations hereunder, Buyer does not have any reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financings will not be
satisfied by Buyer on a timely basis or that the Debt Financings will not be
available in full at the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the Parties agree that (a) Buyer (or a direct or indirect
parent company thereof) may, at the option of the Buyer Guarantor, obtain
financing up to the amount of the Equity Financing as a replacement of all or
part of the Equity Financing in the form of loans and/or notes (the "Buyer
Financing"), the proceeds of which, at the option of the Buyer Guarantor, may
constitute a portion of the Closing Purchase Price to be contributed to the
Company on or prior to the Closing Date and (b) a breach of this
representation and warranty shall not result in the failure of a condition
precedent to Seller's obligations under this Agreement on the Closing Date to
the extent the Closing occurs and Buyer is otherwise able to satisfy its
obligations set forth in this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof.

Section 4.8 Investment Intent. Buyer is acquiring the Membership Interests for
its own account for investment purposes only and not with a view to any public
distribution thereof or with any intention of selling, distributing or
otherwise disposing of the Membership Interests in a manner



that would violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933
(the "Securities Act"). Buyer agrees that the Membership Interests may not be
sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise
disposed of without registration under the Securities Act and any applicable
state securities laws, except pursuant to an exemption from such registration
under the Securities Act and such laws. Buyer is able to bear the economic
risk of holding the Membership Interests for an indefinite period (including
total loss of its investment), and has sufficient knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits
and risk of its investment.

Section 4.9 Solvency. Immediately following the Closing and after giving
effect to the transaction contemplated hereby and by the other Transaction
Documents, and assuming (i) the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 5.2, (ii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth
in Article III (disregarding any "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" or
similar qualifiers or limitations contained therein) and (iii) that this
Section 4.9 is true for the Company immediately prior to the Closing, Buyer
and the Company on a consolidated basis will be Solvent.

Section 4.10 Buyer's Investigation and Reliance. Buyer is a sophisticated
purchaser and has made its own independent investigation, review and analysis
regarding the Company and the transactions contemplated hereby, which
investigation, review and analysis were conducted by Buyer together with
expert advisors, including legal counsel, that it has engaged for such
purpose. Buyer and its Representatives have been provided with reasonable
access to the Representatives, properties and books and records of the Company
and other information that they have requested in connection with their
investigation of the Company and the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives has made any
representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information concerning the Company contained herein or
made available in connection with Buyer's investigation of the Company, except
as expressly set forth in this Agreement, and Seller and its Affiliates and
Representatives expressly disclaim any and all Liability that may be based on
such information or errors therein or omissions therefrom. Buyer has not
relied and is not relying on any statement, representation or warranty, oral
or written, express or implied, made by Seller or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives, except as expressly set forth in Article III and the
Disclosure Schedule. Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates or
Representatives shall have any Liability to Buyer or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives resulting from the use of any information, documents or
materials made available to Buyer, whether orally or in writing, in the Data
Room or in any confidential information memoranda, management presentations,
due diligence discussions, or in any other form in expectation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates or Representatives is making, directly or indirectly, any
representation or warranty with respect to any estimates, projections,
forecasts, strategies or asset optimization models involving the Company.
Buyer acknowledges that there are inherent uncertainties in attempting to make
such estimates, projections, forecasts, strategies and asset optimization
models and that it takes full responsibility for making its own evaluation of
the adequacy and accuracy of any such estimates, projections, forecasts,
strategies or asset optimization models (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying any such estimates, projections, forecasts, strategies
and asset optimization models). Buyer acknowledges that, should the Closing
occur, Buyer shall acquire the Company on



an "as is" and "where is" basis, except as expressly set forth in Article III
and the Disclosure Schedule. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
representations and warranties in Article III are the result of arms' length
negotiations between sophisticated parties and such representations and
warranties are made, and Buyer is relying on such representations and
warranties, solely for the purposes of (a) Section 5.2(a), and (b) rights to
indemnification under Article IX. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, nothing in this Section 4.10 shall affect the ability of Buyer to
bring any claims for intentional fraud.

Section 4.11 Representation and Warranty Policy. Concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer, Buyer has conditionally
bound a transaction representation and warranties insurance policy in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "RandW Policy").

clause (ii) of the definition of Books and Records) and (ii) shall cause
officers of the Company or its Affiliates to furnish Buyer and its authorized
Representatives with such financial and operating data and other information
with respect to the Business and the assets of the Company as Buyer may from
time to time reasonably request; provided, however, that any such access or
furnishing of information shall be conducted at Buyer's expense and in such a
manner as to not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the
Company or such of its Affiliates, and Buyer and its authorized
Representatives shall not conduct any sampling, testing, boring, drilling or
invasive investigation activities without the prior written consent of Seller,
which consent may be withheld in Seller's sole discretion. The Company or its
Affiliates shall have the right to have a Representative present at all times
during any such inspections, interviews and examinations. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller, the Company or its
Affiliates shall not be required to disclose any information to Buyer or its
Representatives if Seller determines, in its sole discretion, acting
reasonably, that (A) such disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client or
other legal privilege, (B) such disclosure would contravene any Applicable
Law, fiduciary duty or a binding agreement entered into prior to the date
hereof, (C) such information is pertinent to any litigation in which the
Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties, (D) such information
should not be disclosed due to its competitively sensitive nature or (E) such
information relates to any consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return filed
by Seller, the Company or any of their Affiliates or any of their respective
predecessor entities. Buyer hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold
harmless each of the Seller Indemnified Group from and against any and all
Losses arising out of, resulting from or relating to any field visit,
environmental property assessment, or other investigation activities or other
due diligence activity conducted by Buyer or any of its Representatives with
respect to the Company or the Leased Real Property, EVEN IF SUCH LOSSES ARISE
OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, SOLELY OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE,
CONCURRENT OR



COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER FAULT BY ANY OF THE SELLER
INDEMNIFIED GROUP, EXCEPTING ONLY LOSSES ACTUALLY RESULTING ON ACCOUNT OF
VIOLATION OF LAW, THE WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF ANY OF THE
SELLER INDEMNIFIED GROUP. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, nothing
disclosed to Buyer or its Representatives under this Section 7.2, nor any
other investigation conducted by or on behalf of Buyer or its Affiliates,
shall modify, amend or affect Buyer's rights under this Agreement and the
other documents contemplated by this Agreement and by the other Transaction
Documents (including for purposes of Articles III and IX).

(b) From the date of the execution of this Agreement by both Parties to the
Closing Date, each Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing of
(i) any Action that is instituted or threatened against such Party to
restrain, prohibit or otherwise challenge the legality or propriety of any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement or by the other Transaction
Documents or (ii) any facts, events, circumstances, actions or developments
which become known to a Party, the existence or occurrence of which will or is
reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in Section 5.1
or Section 5.2 of this Agreement becoming incapable of being satisfied.

(c) Promptly following the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer, or
make reasonably accessible to Buyer on the Company's computer system, the
Books and Records in its possession not previously not provided to Buyer.
Buyer agrees that Seller may retain a copy of all Books and Records and other
materials relating to the Business and the assets of the Company and, after
the Closing Date, Seller agrees to keep such information confidential except
as may be required by Applicable Law or except to the extent any such
information is or becomes generally available to the public (without any
breach of this confidentiality covenant) prior to the time of disclosure.

(d) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by Seller (as it relates to the Company), for a period of seven (7)
years after the Closing, Buyer shall (i) retain the Books and Records relating
to periods prior to the Closing and (ii) afford the Representatives of Seller
reasonable access (including the right to make, at Seller's expense,
photocopies), during normal business hours, to such Books and Records;
provided, however, that Buyer shall notify Seller in writing at least thirty
(30) days in advance of destroying any such Books and Records prior to the
seventh anniversary of the Closing Date in order to provide Seller the
opportunity to copy such Books and Records in accordance with this Section
7.2(d); provided, however, Buyer, the Company (following the Closing) or its
Affiliates shall not be required to disclose any information to Seller or its
Representatives if Buyer determines, in its sole discretion, acting
reasonably, that (A) such disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client or
other legal privilege, (B) such disclosure would contravene any Applicable
Law, fiduciary duty or a binding agreement to any third party, (C) such
information is pertinent to any litigation in which Buyer, the Company or any
of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates, on
the other hand, are adverse parties or (D) such information relates to any
consolidated, combined or unitary



Tax Return filed by Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates or any of
their respective predecessor entities.

Section 7.3 Further Assurances. Each Party shall, at its own cost and expense,
at any time and from time to time, upon reasonable request of the other Party,
use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) do, execute, acknowledge and
deliver, and cause to be done, executed, acknowledged and delivered, all such
further acts, transfers or assignments as may be reasonably required to
consummate the transactions in accordance with the terms hereof, and (b) take
such other actions as may be reasonably required in order to carry out the
intent of this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall any Party
be required to take any action which increases in any way the Liability of
such Party or would require the payment of any material amount by such Party
or which, in the opinion of its counsel, is unlawful or would or could
constitute a violation of any Applicable Law or require the approval of any
Governmental Entity (except to the extent provided herein with respect to
obtaining any such approvals from any Governmental Entity).

Section 7.4 Authorizations and Consents. Each Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all authorizations, consents, orders, and
approvals of, and to give all notices to and make all filings with, all
Governmental Entities (including those pertaining to Governmental Approvals)
that may be or become necessary for its execution and delivery of, and the
performance of its obligations under, this Agreement and will cooperate fully
with the other Party in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations,
consents, orders, and approvals, giving such notices, and making such filings.
Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer and Seller shall, and Seller shall cause
the Company to, make all filings with the Governmental Entities listed on
Items 3 and 8 of Section 3.5 of the Disclosure Schedule as promptly as
practicable, and in any event, within seven (7) Business Days after the date
of this Agreement. The Parties hereto shall have the right to review in
advance all filings made with a Governmental Entity as contemplated herein and
shall cooperate in good faith on the form and substance of such filings. Each
Party shall keep the other apprised in a prompt manner of the status and
substance of any communications with, and inquiries or requests for additional
information from, any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents. The Parties
shall promptly respond to such inquiries or requests for additional
information made by any Governmental Entity, use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to participate in any hearings, settlement proceedings or
other Actions ordered with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause
all filings, applications, registrations, consents and authorizations required
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
obtained at the earliest practicable date after the date of applicable filing.
The Parties shall have the right to review in advance all characterizations of
the information relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
which appear in any filings, applications, registrations, consents and
authorizations made in connection with such transactions and the submitting
Party shall consider in good faith any revisions reasonably requested by the
reviewing Party. No Party shall participate in any formal or substantive in-
person meeting or telephone conference or discussion with any Governmental
Entity in connection with any filings, applications, registrations, consents
or authorizations made in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the
extent



permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meeting, conference or discussion.

Section 7.5 Public Announcements. Prior to either Party or any of its
respective Affiliates issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (including any disclosure of the Closing Purchase Price or any
adjustment thereto), such Party shall first obtain the written consent of the
other Party, except for statements as may be required by Applicable Law or the
rules of any applicable stock exchange. Such consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein
shall restrict Seller, Buyer, the Company, the Financing Sources or the Buyer
Financing Sources or their respective Affiliates from making customary
announcements and communications in connection with the arrangement and
syndication of the Debt Financings and/or the Buyer Financings, as applicable.

Section 7.6 Confidentiality. Each of Buyer and Seller hereby acknowledges that
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents, it or its Affiliates have received and will
continue to receive certain confidential or propriety documents and
information of the other Party (or its Affiliates). All such materials
reviewed or received shall be deemed to be "Evaluation Material" (as defined
in the Confidentiality Agreement) for the purposes of the Confidentiality
Agreement. Each of Buyer and Seller acknowledges that (A) it and its
Affiliates are bound by the Confidentiality Agreement, (B) it will not, and it
will not permit any of its Affiliates or Representatives to, use or disclose
any Evaluation Material except as permitted by the Confidentiality Agreement
and (C) notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary but subject to the next sentence
of this Section 7.6, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. If the Closing occurs,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall cease to apply (which modification shall
be effective as of the Closing Date) only with respect to the confidential
information concerning the Business or the Customers or other customers of the
Business but shall continue in accordance with its terms with respect to
confidential information concerning Seller and its Affiliates and their
respective businesses and any other information disclosed by Seller or any of
its Affiliates to Buyer or its Affiliates, or any of their respective
Representatives.

Section 7.7 Customer Disclosure. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.5
and Section 7.6, Seller and the Company shall have the right to provide any
notice to any Governmental Entity or other Person required by Applicable Law
or Contract with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and by the other Transaction Documents, provided that, prior to delivering any
such notice, Seller or the Company shall provide Buyer a reasonable
opportunity to review and approve, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned, the form and substance of such notice.

Section 7.8 Non-Competition; Non-Disparagement; Non-Solicitation; No Hire.

(a) Seller's Agreement Not to Compete and Non-Disparagement.



(i) Seller covenants and agrees that, during the twenty-four (24) month period
following the Closing Date, Seller will, and will cause its Affiliates to,
directly or indirectly, refrain from owning any interest in, carrying on,
managing, controlling, operating or engaging in the business of competitively
selling or marketing natural gas to retail customers in the United States of
America (a "Competing Business").

(ii) Notwithstanding the restrictions contained in Section 7.8(a)(i), Seller
or any of Seller's Affiliates may own an aggregate of not more than five
percent (5%) of the outstanding stock of any class of any publicly traded
entity engaged in a Competing Business without violating the provisions of
Section 7.8(a)(i) as long as Seller or its Affiliates do not have the power to
control, manage or direct the management, operations or affairs of any such
publicly traded entity.

(b) The Parties agree that the limitations as to time, geographical area and
scope of activity to be restrained as set forth in Section 7.8(a), Section
7.8(d) and Section 7.8(e) are reasonable and do not impose any greater
restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill that Seller is selling and
causing to be sold pursuant to this Agreement and are necessary to protect the
legitimate business interests of Buyer and that these limitations are intended
to comply with all Applicable Laws. To the extent that any part of Section
7.8(a), Section 7.8(d) or Section 7.8(e), as applicable, may be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable for any reason, it is intended that such part shall
be enforceable to the maximum extent that a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such part, if more limited in scope, would have been
enforceable, such part shall be deemed to have been so written and the
remaining parts shall as written be effective and enforceable in all events
and the Parties agree to request that such court enforce Section 7.8(a),
Section 7.8(d) or Section 7.8(e), as applicable, as if so written.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions contained in Section
7.8(a):

(i) shall not apply to Seller or its Affiliates following (A) the acquisition
by a third party of all of the equity interests in CenterPoint Energy, Inc. or
Seller or all or substantially all of Seller's assets, or (B) the merger or
consolidation of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. or Seller with a third party
resulting in the shareholders of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. or Seller, as
applicable, immediately prior to the consummation of such merger or
consolidation (1) owning directly or indirectly, in the aggregate, less than
50% of the resulting entity or such third party and (2) not having the right
or ability to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of
the resulting entity or such third party, in each case, solely to the extent
that such third party is engaged in a Competing Business at the time of such
acquisition, merger or consolidation;

(ii) will not prohibit Seller or its Affiliates from acquiring a business or
any interest in a business that is involved in a Competing Business; provided,
that the fair market value of the portion of such business or assets involved
in a Competing Business shall not constitute more than 25% of the fair market
value of the overall transaction; and



(iii) will not prohibit Seller or its Affiliates from (A) engaging in natural
gas sales to, and natural gas and transportation and storage for, customers in
markets in which competitively selling or marketing natural gas to retail
customers is not permitted by Applicable Law or where Seller or such Affiliate
is a "provider of last resort" by Applicable Law for such customers; (B)
owning or operating interstate or intrastate pipelines and pipeline
interconnects; (C) engaging in the delivery of natural gas (including LNG and
CNG) utilizing trucks and customized equipment; and (D) engaging in,
conducting or having an ownership interest in, any of the businesses (or
activities related to such businesses) conducted by the Seller or its
Affiliates (other than the Company) as of the date of this Agreement (the
"Retained Business"), including the utilization of data or other information
generated prior to Closing from a supplier or customer of the Business for use
in the Retained Business.

(d) Seller covenants and agrees that, during the twelve (12) month period
following the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Buyer, Seller
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates to not, directly or indirectly,
solicit, hire or attempt to solicit or hire, and will not direct or cause its
Affiliates to solicit, hire or attempt to solicit or hire, any Acquired
Employee who is then (or was at any time within three (3) months prior to the
time of such solicitation, hiring or attempt to solicit or hire) an employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or otherwise induce or influence
any such person to terminate their employment or engagement with the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company, or to terminate or breach their employment
agreement with Company or any Subsidiary; provided, that the restrictions in
this Section 7.8(d) shall not apply with respect to any general solicitations
for employment or engagement (whether by newspaper, internet advertisement,
headhunter solicitation or otherwise) not specifically targeted at any
employee of the Company or Subsidiary or the hiring of any Person (i) who
responds to such a solicitation; (ii) who contacts Seller or its Affiliates on
his or her own initiative without any prior solicitation by or on behalf of
Seller or its Affiliates; (iii) whose employment or engagement, as applicable,
with Buyer, the Company or any Affiliate thereof was terminated involuntarily;
or (iv) who voluntarily terminated his or her employment with Buyer, the
Company, or any Affiliate thereof more than three (3) months prior to being
hired and employed by Seller or any of its Affiliates.

(e) Seller covenants and agrees that, during the twelve (12) month period
following the Closing Date, Seller shall cause its officers and shall cause
CEIP's officers who, as a part of their regular duties, communicate (whether
in writing or orally) with the customers of the Business, to not intentionally
make any statements or otherwise intentionally communicate (whether in writing
or orally) to any customer of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
Closing Date that disparages the Company and/or its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Seller
or its Affiliates and Representatives from making truthful statements that are
required by Applicable Law.

Section 7.9 Use of Name. Promptly following the Closing Date, and in any case
no later than three (3) Business Days following the Closing Date, (i) Buyer
shall make all necessary filings



to cause the legal name of the Company to be changed to a name that does not
contain the word "CenterPoint" or any confusingly similar word or phrase and
(ii) cause the Company to cease to hold itself out as having any affiliation
with Seller or any of its Affiliates, except to the extent the consent of a
Governmental Entity is required to cease using or to change such name in any
jurisdiction, in which case Buyer shall cease use of such name as soon as such
consent is obtained and in any event, within one hundred twenty (120) days
following the Closing. Buyer agrees that it shall, as soon as practicable
after the Closing Date and in any event within ninety (90) days following the
Closing Date, cease to make any use of the name "CenterPoint" or any service
marks, trademarks, trade names, identifying symbols, logos, emblems, signs or
insignia containing or comprising the foregoing and any name or mark
confusingly similar thereto (collectively, the "Subject Marks"), subject to
this Section 7.9. In furtherance thereof, as promptly as practicable but in no
event later than ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate all Subject Marks from all
materials used by the Company, including any vehicles, business cards,
schedules, stationery, packaging materials, displays, signs, promotional
materials, manuals, forms, invoices, and other materials (except Software);
provided that Seller hereby grants to the Company a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable license under the Subject
Marks for a period of ninety (90) days following the Closing Date to continue
to use the Subject Marks in the ordinary course of business; provided,
further, that the continued appearance of the Subject Marks on any such
materials or other assets bearing the Subject Marks prior to Closing, in each
case, that are used in the ordinary internal operation of the Business and are
not typically observed by the public shall be permitted until such materials
and assets are retired in the ordinary course of business. For the avoidance
of doubt, Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company, following the
Closing) shall not be deemed to have violated this Section 7.9 or to have
infringed the rights of Seller or its Affiliates by reason of the use of the
Subject Marks in a non-trademark manner for purposes of conveying to
customers, suppliers, any Governmental Entity or the general public that the
names of the Company have changed, that there was a change in ownership, or
the historical origins of the Business.

Section 7.10 Release of Seller Guarantees; Continuing Guarantees.

(a) Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that, effective as of
the Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company), as
applicable, shall be fully and unconditionally released from all Liabilities
relating to, arising under or out of, or in connection with any letters of
credit, guarantees (including performance guarantees), surety bonds, or cash
deposits (collectively, "Credit Support") related to the Business set forth on
Section 7.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule (which list shall be updated by
Seller prior to the Closing to reflect any Credit Support entered into or
provided after the date hereof and on or prior to the Closing Date not in
violation of Section 7.1(b)(iii)) and any Credit Support issued in renewal
thereof or substitution therefor after the date hereof in the ordinary course
of business (each, a "Continuing Guarantee"), and substitute arrangements with
respect thereto shall be in effect.

(b) Prior to or effective as of Closing, Buyer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause (1) all trades under each of the Company's natural gas supply
agreements pertaining to the Credit Support set forth on Section 7.10(b) of
the Disclosure Schedule (such Credit



Support, collectively, the "Specified Guarantees") to be novated to the Shell
Financing Sources and (2) Seller and its Affiliates to be fully and
unconditionally released from all Liabilities relating to, arising under or
out of, or in connection with such Specified Guarantees. If Buyer is not
successful, following the use of its reasonable best efforts, in obtaining the
full and unconditional release of Seller and its Affiliates from any Specified
Guarantees effective as of the Closing, then:

(i) from and after the Closing, Buyer shall continue to use its reasonable
best efforts to cause any trades pertaining to Specified Guarantees to be
novated to the Shell Financing Sources and obtain the full and unconditional
release of Seller and its Affiliates in respect of such Specified Guarantees;

(ii) Buyer shall not and shall cause the Company not to, effect any amendments
or modifications or any other changes to the supply agreements to which such
Specified Guarantees relate, or to otherwise take any action, in each case
that accelerates the Liability of Seller or its Affiliates under such
Specified Guarantees, without Sellers' prior written consent, which consent
may be withheld in Sellers' sole and absolute discretion; and

(iii) if there is any outstanding Specified Supply Exposure (whether such
guarantees have been terminated or not) that remains outstanding 90 days after
the Closing, then on the last Business Day of each one (1) month period
following such 90th day after the Closing Date until such time as no Specified
Supply Exposure remains, Buyer shall pay Seller a fee in respect of each
applicable Specified Guarantee, with such fee determined as follows: starting
on the last Business Day of the first one (1) month period following the 90th
date after the Closing Date, the fee shall be calculated at a rate of three
percent (3%) (on a per annum basis) on the aggregate dollar amount of the
Specified Supply Exposure as of such month-end date, and the rate of such fee
shall increase by an additional one percent (1%) (on a per annum basis) on the
last Business Day of each subsequent three (3) month period with respect to
any remaining Specified Supply Exposure; provided, however, that if the rate
for calculating any fee payable under this Section 7.10(b)(iii) would exceed
the highest rate permitted under Applicable Law, then the rate shall be
automatically reduced to the maximum lawful rate. On the last Business Day of
each month following the Closing Date, the Company shall furnish to Seller a
certificate, signed by the chief financial officer of the Company, certifying
as to the amount of the Specified Supply Exposure as of such date with
reasonable support for the calculation of such amount.

(c) To the extent any Continuing Guarantee that is designated as a supply
guarantee on Section 7.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule (each, a "Supply
Guarantee") is not replaced prior to the Closing, Seller shall, effective as
of the fourth (4th) Business Day following the Closing (the "Supply Trading
Cutoff Date"), have the right to terminate such Continuing Guarantee with
respect to any trades made thereafter and thereafter such Continuing Guarantee
shall only cover any claims relating to any trades made before the



termination of such Supply Guarantee. Prior to the Supply Trading Cutoff Date,
the Company shall have the right to make further trades in the ordinary course
of business for the purchase of next day gas and/or end-of-month gas under
such Supply Guarantees in an aggregate amount not to exceed $10,000,000.

(d) To the extent that any Supply Guarantee (other than a Specified Guarantee)
is not replaced at or prior to the Closing in accordance with Section 7.10(a),
(1) Buyer shall, as promptly as reasonably practical after the Closing and in
any case, no later than ninety (90) days following the Closing, cause all
trades underlying such Supply Guarantee to be unwound with the applicable
counterparty with no further liability to Seller or its Affiliates and (2)
following the Closing, subject to Section 7.10(c), Buyer shall not, and shall
cause the Company not to, make any further trades under the supply agreements
covered by such Supply Guarantees.

(e) To the extent that any Continuing Guarantee that is designated as a
Transportation, Storage and Other Guarantee on Section 7.10(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule (each, a "Transportation, Storage and Other Guarantee") is not replaced
prior to the Closing, Buyer shall as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Closing and in any case, no later than ninety (90) days following the
Closing, (1) furnish the beneficiary thereof such other substitute credit
support as is requested by the beneficiary in the form of a parental guaranty,
cash deposit or letter of credit and (2) use its reasonable best efforts to
cause Seller and its Affiliates to be fully and unconditionally released from
all liabilities relating to, arising under or out of, or in connection with
the Transportation, Storage and Other Guarantees; provided, that Buyer's
obligation to provide such substitute credit support in respect of the
Transportation, Storage and Other Guarantees shall not exceed, in the aggregate,
$150,000,000 (the "Transportation, Storage and Other Guarantees Cap"). For a
period of six (6) months following the Closing (the "Transportation, Storage and
Other Guarantee Transaction Period"), the Company may continue to engage in
transactions under the transportation, storage and other agreements that shall
remain covered by the outstanding Transportation, Storage and Other Guarantees
in the ordinary course of business consistent with the Company's practices
prior to the Closing such that Seller's obligations under the Transportation,
Storage and Other Guarantees following the Closing will not be more than 10%
higher than Seller's obligations thereunder as of Closing; provided that
during the Transportation, Storage and Other Guarantee Transaction Period, the
Company shall not renew, or extend the term of, any transaction under a
transportation, storage or other agreement covered by an outstanding
Transportation, Storage and Other Guarantee prior to the end of the current term
of such transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, after the end of the
Transportation, Storage and Other Guarantee Transaction Period, the Buyer or the
Company shall provide alternative credit support for any new transactions,
renewals (including renewals by way of an "evergreen" or automatic renewal
provision), or extensions of term of existing transactions under the
transportation, storage and other agreements existing as of the Closing Date,
and any such transactions shall not be covered by any outstanding
Transportation, Storage and Other Guarantee. Any such alternative credit support
provided in accordance with the preceding sentence shall not count toward the
Transportation, Storage and Other Guarantees Cap. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary



in this Agreement, if there is any Transportation and Storage Exposure (whether
such guarantees have been terminated or not) that remains outstanding 90 days
after the Closing, then, on the last Business Day of each one (1) month period
following such 90th day after the Closing Date until such time as no
Transportation and Storage Exposure remains outstanding under such
Transportation, Storage and Other Guarantees, Buyer shall pay Seller a fee in
respect of each applicable Transportation, Storage and Other Guarantee, with
such fee determined as follows: starting on the last Business Day of the first
one (1) month period following the 90th date after the Closing Date, the fee
shall be calculated at a rate of three percent (3%) (on a per annum basis) on
the aggregate dollar amount of the Transportation and Storage Exposure as of
such month-end date, and the rate of such fee shall increase by an additional
one percent (1%) (on a per annum basis) on the last Business Day of each
subsequent three (3) month period with respect to any remaining Transportation
and Storage Exposure; provided, however, that if the rate for calculating any
fee payable under this Section 7.10(e) would exceed the highest rate permitted
under Applicable Law, then the rate shall be automatically reduced to the
maximum lawful rate. On the last Business Day of each month following the
Closing Date, the Company shall furnish to Seller a certificate, signed by the
chief financial officer of the Company, certifying as to the amount of the
Transportation and Storage Exposure as of such date with reasonable support for
the calculation of such amount.

(f) From and after the Closing, the Buyer or the Company shall, if required,
provide alternative credit support for any new transactions entered into by
the Company after the Closing under any transportation, storage or other
agreements not covered by the outstanding Transportation, Storage and Other
Guarantees. Any such alternative credit support provided in accordance with
the preceding sentence shall not count toward the Transportation, Storage and
Other Guarantees Cap.

(g) From and after the Closing, Buyer will indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates from any Losses arising from or relating to
any Continuing Guarantee that has not been replaced as of the Closing Date. If
at any time after the Closing, any Continuing Guarantee is drawn upon by a
counterparty thereto or beneficiary thereof, Buyer shall reimburse Seller or
the applicable obligor thereunder for the full amount that is drawn under such
Continuing Guarantee within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of written
demand therefor.

(h) At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller, the Shell Guaranty in an
amount equal to the lesser of (i) the estimated outstanding exposure under all
Continuing Guarantees (as evidenced by the Company's current and future cash
payment obligations under the underlying supply, transportation and storage
agreements supported thereby) not replaced by Buyer at or prior to the Closing
(the "Continuing Guarantee Amount") and (ii) $40,000,000 (the "Shell Guaranty
Cap"); provided, that (i) Buyer shall not be obligated to deliver any Credit
Support to Seller other than the Shell Guaranty and (ii) the amount of the
Shell Guaranty shall be reduced from time to time upon presentation by Buyer
to Seller of satisfactory evidence reflecting any Continuing Guarantee
replaced or substituted by the Shell Financing Sources or otherwise to the
applicable counterparties after the Closing (but



only to the extent that the Continuing Guarantee Amount included obligations
covered by such Continuing Guarantee) and the full and unconditional release
of Seller from all liabilities relating to, arising under or out of, or in
connection with such Continuing Guarantees; provided, however, that to the
extent the Continuing Guarantee Amount exceeds the Shell Guaranty Cap at the
Closing, the amount of the Shell Guaranty shall not be reduced until the
amount of outstanding exposure under all Continuing Guarantees following the
Closing has been reduced to an amount equal to the Shell Guaranty Cap.

(i) Seller shall cooperate with Buyer to facilitate the release of the
Continuing Guarantees and the novation of the trades under each of the supply
agreements set forth on Section 7.10(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, including
initiating contact with each of the counterparties and requesting such release
or novation, providing all necessary information as reasonably requested by
Buyer and providing legal and financial personnel of Seller to interact with
Buyer and the counterparties.

Section 7.11 Antitrust Laws.

(a) Buyer shall and Seller shall cause the Company to (i) make all filings
required of each of them under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable
and, in any event, within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement in the case of all Notification and Report Form filings required
under the HSR Act and, as promptly as reasonably practicable, in the case of
all other filings required by other Antitrust Laws, (ii) comply at the
earliest practicable date with any request under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws for additional information, documents, or other materials
received by each of them from the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other
Governmental Entity in respect of such filings or such transactions, and (iii)
reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with any such filing and in
connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any of the
FTC, the Antitrust Division or other Governmental Entity under any Antitrust
Laws with respect to any such filing or any such transaction. Each such Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to each other all
information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant
to any Applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or by the other Transaction Documents. Each such Party shall
promptly inform the other Parties hereto of any oral communication with, and
provide copies of written communications with, any Governmental Entity
regarding any such filings or any such transaction. No Party shall participate
in any formal or substantive meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect
of any such filings, investigations, or other inquiry without giving the other
Parties prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and participate. Subject to
Applicable Law, the Parties will consult and cooperate with one another in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
Party hereto relating to Actions under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws.
Seller and Buyer may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under
this Section 7.11 as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be



given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the
recipient, unless express written permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials (Seller or Buyer, as the case may be).

(b) Without limiting the generality of the Parties' undertaking pursuant to
Section 7.11(a), Buyer agrees to use its reasonable best efforts and to take
any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment or
objection, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by the other
Transaction Documents under the HSR Act and any other applicable federal,
state or foreign laws that are designed to govern foreign investment or
competition, or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization, lessening of competition or restraint of
trade (together with the HSR Act, the "Antitrust Laws") so as to enable the
Parties expeditiously to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and by the other Transaction Documents as promptly as practicable and in no
event later than the Termination Date, including (i) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or
otherwise, the sale, divesture or disposition of such assets, properties or
businesses of the Buyer, the Company, and their respective Subsidiaries; (ii)
otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after the Closing Date
would limit Buyer's or its Subsidiaries' freedom of action with respect to, or
its or their ability to retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines
or assets of Buyer, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries, in each
case as may be required to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other Order or decision in
any suit or proceeding, that would have the effect of materially delaying or
preventing the consummation of such transactions. Buyer and, if requested by
Buyer, the Company shall agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate, or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action
with respect to Buyer, or Buyer's Subsidiaries', ability to retain any of the
businesses, product lines or assets of Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries; provided that any such action is conditioned upon the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.11(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement will
require Buyer to take any action that would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the assets, Liabilities, business, results of
operation, or condition (whether financial, operational or otherwise) of the
Company.

(c) From the date hereof, Buyer shall not, nor shall Buyer permit any of its
Affiliates (other than with respect to Calpine Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) to, acquire (or agree to acquire) any assets, property or
securities if, individually or in the aggregate, such acquisition or
acquisitions would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede,
materially interfere with or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 7.12 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.



(a) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law, the
individuals who on or prior to the Closing Date were directors, officers or
employees of the Company, other than those Persons who are not employed by the
Company at the Closing (collectively, the "Covered Persons") with respect to
all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such or taken at the
request of the Company at any time prior to the Closing Date. Buyer agrees
that all rights of the Indemnitees to indemnification and exculpation from
Liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date as
provided in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or comparable
organizational documents of the Company as now in effect, and any
indemnification agreements or arrangements of the Company shall survive the
Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms. Such rights shall not be amended, or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights of the Covered Persons, unless
such modification is required by Applicable Law or approved by such Covered
Persons. In addition, Buyer shall pay any expenses of any Covered Person under
this Section 7.12, as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
Applicable Law, provided that the Covered Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by
Applicable Law.

(b) The Covered Person shall have the right (but not the obligation) to
control the defense of, including the investigation of, any Actions relating
to any acts or omissions covered under this Section 7.12 (each, a "Claim")
with counsel selected by the Covered Person; provided, however, that (i) Buyer
shall be permitted to participate in the defense of such Claim at its own
expense and (ii) Buyer shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed.

(c) In the event any Claim is asserted or made, any determination required to
be made with respect to whether an Covered Person's conduct complies with the
standards set forth under Applicable Law, the applicable organizational
documents of the Company or any indemnification agreements or arrangements of
the Company shall be made by independent legal counsel selected by such
Covered Person.

(d) Each of Buyer and the Covered Person shall cooperate, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense of any Claim and
shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and
furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

(e) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall obtain a directors' and officers' liability insurance covering
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date or obtain a tail policy
with respect to those persons who are currently covered by Seller's or its
Affiliates' directors' and officers' liability insurance policy which shall
provide for a coverage amount of no less than $15,000,000, a retention amount
of no more than $250,000 and offer coverage that is otherwise, in the
aggregate, no less favorable to such directors and officers than the insurance
coverage which would



customarily be maintained by a Person operating a business comparable (in size
and scope) to the Company; provided, further, that if such insurance coverage
is not available at a cost not greater than $300,000, then Buyer shall, or
shall cause the Company to, obtain as much coverage as is possible under
substantially similar policies for such annual premiums as do not exceed
$300,000 (unless Seller agrees to treat the amount in excess as a Transaction
Expense).

(f) The provisions of this Section 7.12 (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Covered Person, his or her heirs and his
or her representatives; and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person
may have by Contract or otherwise.

Section 7.13 [Reserved].

Section 7.14 RandW Policy Matters. Pursuant to the terms of the RandW Policy,
Buyer shall: (a) conditionally bind the insurer issuing the RandW Policy as of
the date hereof; (b) pay the premium balance and all other amounts required to
be paid to the insurer issuing the RandW Policy in connection with the issuance
of the RandW Policy; and (c) comply in full in a timely manner with all
requirements that Buyer submit copies of the documents exchanged at Closing to
the insurer. The RandW Policy shall provide that the insurer shall have no right
of subrogation against Seller or its Affiliates, and the insurer shall have
waived any such right of subrogation, except in the case of intentional fraud.
Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller, terminate or
amend or modify the terms of the RandW Policy in a manner adverse to Seller in
any material respect, provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing
shall not be interpreted to in any way limit the Buyer's rights to pursue
claims, secure recovery, or otherwise exercise rights afforded to the Insured
(as defined in the RandW Policy) under the RandW Policy.

Section 7.15 Obligations in Respect of Debt Financing.

(a) Prior to the Closing, each of the Company and Seller agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide, at Buyer's sole cost and expense,
such customary cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financings and the Buyer Financing as is reasonably requested by Buyer. Such
assistance shall include, but not be limited to, the following: (i) solely
with respect to the Buyer Financing and the ABL Financing, participation by
senior management of the Company in, and assistance by senior management of
the Company and/or Seller with, the marketing efforts (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, preparation and delivery to Buyer, the Buyer Financing
Sources and the ABL Financing Sources of any marketing materials requested by
the Buyer Financing Sources and/or the ABL Financing Sources, as applicable);
(ii) obtaining and delivering to Buyer and the Financing Sources, as promptly
as reasonably practicable following Buyer's request, all financial data and
financial information of the Company that is required under each Debt
Commitment Letter to consummate the applicable Debt Financing on or prior to
the date such Debt Financing is to be consummated (including all information
and data necessary to satisfy the conditions set forth in paragraphs 5(a) and
5(b) of Exhibit C to the ABL Commitment Letter (provided, that, for the
avoidance of doubt, neither the Company nor Seller shall be required to
provide, and Buyer shall be solely responsible for (x) the



preparation of any pro forma financial information and pro forma adjustments
to be incorporated into any pro forma financial information, (y) any
description of any Debt Financing or Buyer Financing, as applicable, and (z)
projections, risk factors or other forward-looking statements relating to all
or any component of the Debt Financing or Buyer Financing, as applicable);
(iii) furnishing to Buyer, the Buyer Financing Sources and the Financing
Sources such documentation and other information regarding the business of the
Company required with respect to each Debt Financing and/or the Buyer
Financing, as applicable, under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations; (iv) executing and delivering any
agreements, instruments and other documents, including customary closing
certificates (excluding a solvency certificate), as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer; (v) cooperating with the due diligence processes of the
Financing Sources and the Buyer Financing Sources to the extent reasonable,
(vi) providing information which Buyer will reasonably require in connection
with the completion by Buyer of a customary borrowing base certificate as
contemplated by the ABL Commitment Letter, including reasonably detailed
information as to (A) the counterparty names, counterparty contract name, age
of receivable and amount of receivable for all of the Company's billed and
unbilled accounts receivables with an individual amount in excess of $50,000,
(B) the mark-to-market value of the Company's commodities Contracts with firm
contractual volumes and an individual value in excess of $50,000 and (C) the
value of the Company's inventory with an individual value in excess of $50,000
on a market value basis, (vii) assisting the ABL Financing Sources with a
customary collateral and risk management practices review of the assets of the
Company which are expected to form a part of the borrowing base under the Debt
Financing; (viii) furnishing to Buyer, the Buyer Financing Sources and the
Financing Sources, as applicable, with respect to firm contractual values, a
pro forma position report and a pro forma mark-to-market report of the Company
for the prior two (2) most recently ended consecutive fiscal quarters and (ix)
taking such other actions as are reasonably requested by Buyer, the Buyer
Financing Sources, or the Financing Sources to facilitate the satisfaction of
all conditions precedent to obtaining the (A) Debt Financing set forth in each
Debt Commitment Letter or (B) Buyer Financing, as applicable; provided, that
(A) no board of directors or board of managers of the Seller of any of its
Affiliates, including the Company, shall be required to take any board action
or adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents and instruments
pursuant to which the Debt Financing or the Buyer Financing is obtained, (B)
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to execute prior to
the Closing Date any definitive financing documents, including any credit or
other agreements, pledge or security documents, or other certificates, legal
opinions or documents in connection with the Debt Financing or the Buyer
Financing, and (C) except as expressly provided above, neither Seller nor any
of its Affiliates shall be required to take any actions prior to the Closing
Date to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing or the Buyer Financing,
including any action that would reasonably be expected to conflict with, or
result in a violation or breach of, or default under Seller's or any of its
Affiliates' organizational and governing documents, any Applicable Law or any
Contract to which Seller or any of its Affiliates is a party. Each of the
Company and Seller hereby consents to the customary use of its corporate logos
in marketing materials used in connection with the ABL Financings and the
Buyer Financing; provided, that such corporate logos are used solely in a
manner that is not intended to, nor reasonably likely to, harm or



disparage the Company or Seller. Nothing herein shall require such cooperation
to the extent it would require the Company or its Affiliates to amend or waive
any terms of this Agreement or any other Contract to which any of them is a
party or to the extent it would unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and its Affiliates, cause any representation or
warranty in this Agreement made by Seller to be breached, or cause any
conditions to Closing set forth in Article V to fail to be satisfied.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the condition set
forth in Section 5.2(b), as it applies to Seller's obligations under this
Section 7.15, shall be deemed satisfied unless Seller has knowingly, willfully
and materially breached its obligations under this Section 7.15 and such
breach has been the primary cause of the Debt Financing or the Buyer Financing
not being obtained. No action, liability or obligation of the Company or its
Affiliates under any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or
instrument relating to the Debt Financing or the Buyer Financing shall be
effective until the Closing. Buyer shall promptly, upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company or its Affiliates for all out-of-pocket
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by the
Company, its Affiliates, or their respective Representatives in connection
with the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this
Section 7.15(a).

(b) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect the
obligations of the Financing Sources and the Equity Sponsor under the
Commitment Letters (the "Financing Commitments") and to obtain each Financing
on a timely basis, on the terms and conditions described in the applicable
Commitment Letter, including using its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly
as possible, (i) comply with its obligations under each Debt Commitment
Letter, the Redacted Fee Letter, and any definitive agreements related thereto
(collectively, the "Debt Financing Documents"), (ii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to each Debt Financing consistent with the
terms and conditions contained in the applicable Debt Commitment Letter and
the Redacted Fee Letter (including, as necessary, the "market flex" provisions
contained in the Redacted Fee Letter) by the Closing Date (provided that such
other terms would not reasonably be expected to impair or delay or otherwise
adversely affect the ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or by the Financings), (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions contained in the applicable Debt Financing Documents within its
control, including the payment of any commitment, engagement, or placement
fees required as a condition to each Debt Financing, the funding, or causing
or enforcing the funding of, the Equity Financing, and instructing the
Financing Sources to provide such Financing at the Closing upon satisfaction
of such conditions and using reasonable best efforts to satisfy, or assist in
the satisfaction of any other conditions therein, and (iv) enforce the Equity
Sponsor's obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter, enforce Buyer's
rights under the Equity Commitment Letter, and, at the request of the Company,
taking all enforcement actions against Equity Sponsor. Buyer shall keep the
Company informed upon written request in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financings. Buyer shall
promptly (and in any event, within three (3) Business Days), notify the
Company of (i) the expiration or termination (or attempted or purported
termination, whether or not valid) of any Financing Commitment, (ii) any
written refusal, or threatened refusal in writing, to provide or any intent by
the Equity Sponsor or the Financing Sources or other Persons party to the
Financing



Commitments to provide the full financing contemplated by the Financing
Commitments and (iii) any breach or threatened breach in writing by any party
under a Debt Commitment Letter or related document. If any portion of the
Financing becomes (or if Buyer becomes aware that it is likely to become)
unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments
or any of the Financing Commitments expire or terminate prior to the Closing,
Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that Buyer shall not
permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, a Debt Financing Document, if such amendment,
modification or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing
(including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount) or (ii) imposes new or additional conditions or other terms or
otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of
the Financing or other terms in a manner that could reasonably be expected to
(A) delay or prevent the Closing, (B) make the timely funding of the Financing
or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing less likely to
occur, (C) materially adversely impact the ability of Buyer or the Company or
its Affiliates, as applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to
the Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto or
(D) impose additional material obligations on the Company or its Affiliates
prior to the Closing. Buyer shall have the right to substitute other debt
financing (but not equity financing) for all or any portion of the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters from the same and/or
alternative financing sources; provided, that such substitution shall not (1)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount), (2) provide for terms
that are, in the aggregate, less favorable to the Company than those in the
Debt Commitment Letters, (3) provide any conditions other than those
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters that would reasonably be
expected to delay or prevent the Closing or (4) impose additional material
obligations on the Company or its Affiliates prior to the Closing. (Such
alternative debt financing provided for in either of the two preceding
sentences, the "Alternate Debt Financing".) The new commitment letter and the
fee letter entered into in connection with any Alternate Debt Financing are
referred to, respectively, as a "New Commitment Letter" and "New Fee Letter".
Upon Buyer entering into any such New Commitment Letter or New Fee Letter or
any such amendment, supplement, or modification of the Commitment Letter or
Redacted Fee Letter, Buyer shall provide, within three (3) Business Days,
executed copies thereof to Seller and the term "Commitment Letters" shall
include the New Commitment Letter, supplemented or modified in accordance with
this Section 7.15(b), "Redacted Fee Letter" shall mean the Redacted Fee Letter
as so amended, replaced with a New Fee Letter, supplemented or modified in
accordance with this Section 7.15(b), and "Debt Financings" shall be deemed to
include the Alternate Debt Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, compliance by Buyer with this Section 7.15 shall not
relieve Buyer of its obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, whether or not the Debt Financing or Alternate Debt
Financing is available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 7.15(b), it is understood and agreed that only a breach by Buyer of
the obligations set forth herein that results in the financing contemplated by
the Commitment Letters not being provided shall be deemed to be material.



(c) Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Company and
Seller and their respective Affiliates from and against any and all
Liabilities, losses, damages, Claims, costs, expenses and judgments suffered
or incurred by them in connection with the Debt Financings, the Buyer
Financing (if any) and the performance of their obligations under this Section
7.15, except to the extent such Liabilities, losses, damages, Claims, costs,
expenses or judgments arose out of or resulted from the gross negligence, bad
faith or willful misconduct of the Company or Seller (or any of their
respective Affiliates). Buyer shall, within thirty (30) days following written
request by Seller, reimburse the Company and Seller for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company and Seller
in connection with the cooperation required by this Section 7.15.

Section 7.16 Conversion. At least one (1) day prior to the Closing, Seller
shall cause the Conversion to occur. Seller shall provide to Buyer copies of
all proposed drafts of agreements, instruments, certificates and other
documents relating to the Conversion and an opportunity for Buyer and its
advisors to provide reasonable comments or changes to such agreements,
instruments, certificates and other documents prior to the execution, delivery
or filing of any of the foregoing.

Section 7.17 Seller's Insurance. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that all
insurance policies maintained by Seller in respect of the Company and its
assets and properties (which, for the avoidance of doubt, do not include the
Insurance Policies) may be terminated by Seller at the Closing and that Buyer
shall have no right, title or interests in or to any unearned premiums on any
such insurance policies maintained by Seller. Following the Closing, Buyer
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company) not to, make
any claims under any such insurance policies. Buyer shall arrange insurance
coverage for itself, the Company and their respective assets and properties,
effective as of the Closing, with insurers of its own choice; provided,
however, that in respect of any claims commenced after the Closing Date
arising from an event, circumstance or occurrence prior to the Closing Date,
during the period between the Closing and the six-month anniversary of the
Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates, on behalf of the Company, may request for
Seller to, on Buyer's behalf, subject to the terms and conditions of the
applicable policies, access, submit claims and seek coverage on any of
Seller's or its Affiliates' occurrence-based (but not claims-made) insurance
policies (including the Insurance Policies) covering the Company at the time
of such event, circumstance or occurrence, and Seller and its Affiliates shall
maintain or cause to be maintained all such insurance policies for such
purposes and use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer and its
Affiliates in asserting any such claims and make the benefits of any such
insurance policies available to Buyer and its Affiliates; provided, further,
that Buyer shall be solely liable for, and Seller shall have no obligation to
pay or reimburse Buyer or its Affiliates for, all deductibles, retentions and
all uninsured, uncovered, unavailable or uncollectable amounts and all fees,
costs or expenses incurred by Buyer, relating to or associated with such
claims. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, (1) nothing in this
Agreement shall limit, waive or abrogate in any manner any rights of Seller or
its Affiliates to insurance coverage for any covered claims under its
insurance policies, whether related to the Company or otherwise, and (2)
Seller shall retain the exclusive right to control its insurance policies and
programs, including the right to exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy-back
or otherwise resolve disputes with respect to any insurance policies and
programs or any rights hereunder.

Section 7.18 Company Restructuring. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause
the Company to distribute all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
CenterPoint Energy Intrastate Pipelines, LLC ("CEIP") held by the Company to
Seller or its Affiliates (the "Restructuring"). Following the completion of
the Restructuring, Seller shall retain, and be responsible for all Liabilities
of CEIP with no further Liability to the Company, Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates from and after the Closing. Seller shall provide to
Buyer copies of all proposed drafts of agreements, instruments,



certificates and other documents relating to the Restructuring and an
opportunity for Buyer and its advisors to provide reasonable comments or
changes to such agreements, instruments, certificates and other documents
prior to the execution, delivery or filing of any of the foregoing.

Section 7.19 Exclusivity. Until the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, none of Seller, the Company or their respective
Affiliates shall, and they shall not authorize or knowingly permit any of
their respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit,
initiate or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly
encourage, facilitate or assist, an Acquisition Proposal, (b) furnish to any
Person (other than Buyer or its designees) any nonpublic information relating
to the sale of the Company and/or the Business, or afford to any Person (other
than Buyer or its designees) access to the business, properties, assets,
books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the
Company or its Affiliates, in any such case with the intent to induce the
making, submission or announcement of, or the intent to encourage, facilitate
or assist, an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (c) participate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, or (d) enter into any Contract relating to an Acquisition Proposal.
Seller, the Company and their respective Affiliates shall, and shall cause
their Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Buyer or its
designees) conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

Section 7.20 Termination of Affiliate Agreements. Prior to the Closing, Seller
shall cause to be terminated as of the Closing with no further Liability to
the Company, all Affiliate Agreements other than those Affiliate Agreements
set forth on Section 7.20 of the Disclosure Schedule and the Transition
Services Agreement.

Section 7.21 Office Lease Term Sheet. The Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to enter into a lease (the "Lease") with respect to that certain office
space located at 1111 Louisiana Street, Houston, Harris County, Texas 77002 to
be leased by the Company effective as of the Closing, containing the terms set
forth in the Office Lease Term Sheet attached hereto as Exhibit G.

Section 7.22 Release.

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, except in the case of intentional fraud
by Buyer or its Affiliates, Seller on behalf of itself and each of its current

irrevocably and unconditionally releases and forever discharges Buyer, the
Company, and their Affiliates and each of their respective current and former
officers, directors, employees, partners, managers, members, advisors,

assigns (collectively, the "Buyer Released Parties") of and from any and all
Actions, Liabilities, dues, accounts, bonds, Contracts (whether express or

thing relating to any of the Buyer Released Parties occurring or arising on or
prior to the Closing Date, in Seller's capacity as shareholder or equity
holder in the Company, relating to the ownership and operation of the Company
prior to the Closing; provided,



however, that nothing herein shall release any claims under the terms and
conditions of (i) this Agreement, (ii) the other Transaction Documents or
(iii) any Affiliate Agreement set forth on Section 7.20 of the Disclosure
Schedule.

(b) Effective as of the Closing Date, except in the case of intentional fraud
by Seller or its Affiliates, Buyer on behalf of itself, the Company, and each
of their current and former Affiliates (collectively, the "Buyer Releasing
Parties"), hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases and forever
discharges Seller, its Affiliates and each of their respective current and

Disclosure Schedule.

ARTICLE VIII 
EMPLOYEES

Section 8.1 Continuing Employment.

(a) Buyer shall cause the Company to continue to employ the Acquired Employees
effective on the Closing Date. Such employment shall provide, during a period
of at least twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (the "Protected
Period"), each Acquired Employee who remains employed following the Closing
Date: (i) with a role that has substantially similar duties and
responsibilities, is of the same status (i.e., full-time or part-time), and is
in the same location or within fifty (50) miles of the same location as such
Acquired Employee held immediately prior to the Closing, unless such Acquired
Employee consents to such change in employment duties and responsibilities,
status or location; (ii) with the same or better base salary or hourly wages
as those received by such Acquired Employee immediately prior to the Closing;
and (iii) with other compensation and employee benefits, (including equity or
equity-based incentive compensation (or, alternatively, other incentive
compensation with a substantially equivalent value to existing equity or
equity-based incentive compensation), but excluding annual cash bonuses, which
are addressed in the next sentence) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the less favorable (to the employee) of (A) such compensation and
benefits that are provided to such Acquired Employee as of the date hereof and
(B) such compensation and benefits that are provided to such Acquired Employee
immediately prior to the Closing; provided, however, that no early retirement
subsidies, retention, change-in-control or other special or non-recurring
compensation or benefits provided prior to the Closing Date shall be taken
into account for



purposes of this covenant. In addition, such employment shall provide, during
the remainder of calendar year 2020 following the Closing Date, each Acquired
Employee who remains employed following the Closing Date with the same or
better target annual cash bonus opportunity as such Acquired Employee has
immediately prior to the Closing.

(b) Protected Period.

(i) Buyer covenants that for the Protected Period (or, with respect to annual
cash bonus opportunities, the remainder of calendar year 2020 following the
Closing Date), it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, make any
materially adverse changes to any of the Acquired Employees' terms and
conditions of employment provided under this Section 8.1, other than changes
required to be made by Applicable Laws (subject to providing replacement terms
that are of substantial comparable value in the aggregate) or agreed to by the
Acquired Employee.

(ii) Buyer undertakes that during the Protected Period, Buyer and its
Affiliates shall retain all of the Acquired Employees, provided that Buyer
shall not be in breach of this subsection (ii) as a result of:

(1) any such Acquired Employee giving notice of termination of his/her
employment (including voluntary resignation or retirement);

(2) any such Acquired Employee's employment expiring at the end of a fixed or
temporary term pursuant to a written agreement in place prior to the Closing
Date; or

(3) Buyer or any of its Affiliates terminating the employment of any such
Acquired Employee if it pays severance benefits in accordance with the
provisions of Section 8.1(b)(iii) or if it determines that the Acquired
Employee: (i) committed a material violation of Buyer's or its Affiliates'
employment policies; (ii) was arrested, convicted of, or entered a guilty plea
or plea of no contest to any crime which, in the reasonable opinion of Buyer
or any of its Affiliates, brings the Acquired Employee into disrepute or is
likely to cause material harm to Buyer's or any of its Affiliates' business;
(iii) has misappropriated, stolen or embezzled funds or property from Buyer or
any of its Affiliates; (iv) has committed an act of intentional fraud upon
Buyer or any of its Affiliates; or (v) has engaged in gross or willful
misconduct or insubordination that is likely to cause material harm to Buyer's
or any of its Affiliates' business.

(iii) Without limitation of the Buyer's obligations set forth in Section
8.1(b)(ii), in the event any Acquired Employee is terminated by Buyer or any
of Buyer's Affiliates during the Protected Period for any reason other than
for the matters described in Section 8.1(b)(ii)(3), including termination by
mutual consent, subject to the Acquired Employee's execution and delivery and
non-revocation of a release of claims in favor of Seller, Buyer, and their
respective Affiliates, Buyer or



such Affiliate shall provide the following payments and benefits to the
Acquired Employee: the greatest of (i) a lump sum payment equal to the base
salary or wages the Acquired Employee would have enjoyed for the balance of
the Protected Period, (ii) the severance payments and benefits set forth in
Section 3.19(a) of the Disclosure Schedule in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth therein as the "Company Severance Practice" and (iii) the
severance payments or benefits provided under an applicable Buyer Plan. If
payments are made pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iii) in the immediately
preceding sentence, Buyer shall also subsidize the Acquired Employee's monthly
COBRA premiums for health benefits (with the Acquired Employee paying the
employee portion of the premium at the active employee rate) for a period of
twelve (12) months (the "COBRA Continuation Benefit").

(c) Buyer shall, or cause its Subsidiaries to, recognize the service of the
Acquired Employees with the Company, Seller or any of their Affiliates for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and level of
compensation or benefits for any employee benefit plan, policy, program,
agreement or arrangement maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates in which any
Acquired Employee will participate after the Closing (a "Buyer Plan"), except
(x) with respect to benefit accrual under qualified and nonqualified defined
benefit pension plans or (y) to the extent such recognition would result in
the duplication of benefits. In addition, Buyer or its Affiliates, as
applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such Buyer
Plan to: (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions
and waiting periods, other than preexisting condition limitations, exclusions
or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such Acquired
Employees under the analogous welfare Benefit Plan immediately prior to the
Closing, and (ii) recognize for each Acquired Employee and his or her covered
dependents for purposes of applying annual deductible, co-payment and out-of-
pocket maximums under such Buyer Plan any deductible, co-payment and
out‑of‑pocket expenses paid by the Acquired Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the calendar year prior to the Closing under
an analogous Benefit Plan as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such Buyer Plan for the same plan year.

(d) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company to continue to
recognize all accrued and unused vacation days (including banked days) that
have accrued to Acquired Employees through the Closing and recognize the
service of the Acquired Employees with the Company for purposes of eligibility
and levels of benefits with respect to Buyer's policies governing personal,
sickness and other paid time off.

(e) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer (or one of its Affiliates) shall
establish a Section 125 of the Code flexible spending account plan and related
account for each Acquired Employee (the "Buyer FSAP") for the then remaining
portion of the calendar year in which the Closing occurs. The Buyer FSAP will
recognize the elections that each Acquired Employee had in effect under
Section 125 of the Code flexible spending account plan with Seller or any of
its Affiliates (the "Seller FSAP"), subject to the applicable dollar limits of
the Buyer FSAP for the calendar year in which such Acquired Employee becomes
covered under the Buyer FSAP. Buyer (or one of its Affiliates) shall cause the
Buyer FSAP to assume



the account balances (whether positive or negative) associated with the
Acquired Employees' flexible spending accounts under the Seller FSAP (the
"Transferred Account Balances"), and the Buyer FSAP shall be responsible for
reimbursement of all previously unreimbursed medical and dependent care claims
incurred by the Acquired Employees in such calendar year. As soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, and in any event within ten (10) Business
Days after the amount of the Transferred Account Balances is determined, as
part of Buyer's assumption of the Acquired Employees' flexible spending
account balances under the Seller FSAP, Seller (or one of its Affiliates)
shall pay Buyer (or one of its Affiliates) the net aggregate amount of the
Transferred Account Balances, if such amount is positive, and Buyer (or one of
its Affiliates) shall pay Seller (or one of its Affiliates) the net aggregate
amount of the Transferred Account Balances, if such amount is negative.

(f) Seller shall provide any required notice under and otherwise comply with,
and retain all Liabilities relating to, WARN with respect to any event
affecting Acquired Employees on or prior to the Closing Date (including as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by the other
Transaction Documents). On the Closing Date, Seller shall notify Buyer of any
"employment loss" (as defined in WARN) experienced by any Acquired Employee
during the 90-day period prior to the Closing Date. During the 90-day period
beginning on the Closing Date, Buyer shall ensure that the Company does not
terminate (actually or constructively) the employment of any Acquired
Employees so as to cause any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as those terms
are defined in WARN) such that Seller has any obligation under WARN that
Seller otherwise would not have had absent such terminations.

(g) In no event later than the "Payment Date" as defined in the CenterPoint
Energy, Inc. Short Term Incentive Plan (the "STI"), Seller or its Affiliates
shall cause to be paid to Acquired Employees who are participants in the STI
any "Awards" (as defined in the STI) determined payable with respect to the
2019 "Plan Year" (as defined in the STI) to any such Acquired Employees in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the STI. Prior to the Closing
Date, Seller or its Affiliates shall cause to be paid to Acquired Employees
who are participants in the STI prorated "Awards" with respect to the 2020
"Plan Year" based on the portion of such Plan Year completed prior to the
Closing Date, using any good faith methodology determined by Seller. From and
after the Closing, the Acquired Employees will participate in Buyer's short-
term incentive program with proration based on the portion of 2020 following
the Closing Date.

(h) On and following the Closing Date, Buyer or its Affiliates shall
immediately inform Seller of any termination of employment or service of any
Acquired Employee from Buyer or any of its Affiliates. Seller shall pay the
Acquired Employees any deferred compensation owing in connection with any such
termination under Seller's nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements, in
accordance with the terms thereof and Section 409A of the Code. Acquired
Employees shall continue to vest in all outstanding equity awards they hold
with respect to common stock of Seller that were granted in 2018 or 2019 on
the regularly scheduled vesting dates for such awards, subject to continued
employment with Buyer or its Affiliates (and subject to Seller's right to
accelerate vesting in its sole discretion).



Section 8.2 Benefit Plans. Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller shall
cause the Company to cease being a participating employer with respect to the
Benefit Plans that are not Company Plans so that each Acquired Employee shall
cease to participate in such Benefit Plans. Seller shall retain sponsorship
of, and shall retain all liabilities under such Benefit Plans that are not
Company Plans, whether arising before, on or after the Closing, and Purchaser
and its Affiliates shall not assume sponsorship of, contribute to or maintain,
or have any liability with respect to, such Benefit Plans. Seller or its
Affiliates shall be liable for claims for benefits by Acquired Employees under
any Benefit Plans that are welfare benefit plans arising out of occurrences
prior to the Closing Date. Seller or its Affiliates shall be liable for
compliance with the requirements of COBRA with respect to all Acquired
Employees, and their respective eligible spouses and dependents, for whom a
qualifying event (within the meaning of COBRA) occurs at any time prior to the
Closing Date (including qualifying events that occur in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by the other Transaction
Documents). Seller or its Affiliates shall be liable for workers' compensation
benefits arising out of occurrences prior to the Closing Date. If any Acquired
Employee has become disabled (within the meaning of the applicable Benefit
Plan that provides long-term disability benefits) prior to the Closing Date,
Seller or its Affiliates will retain liability for the provision of disability
benefits payable to such employee under Seller's welfare benefit plans, if
any, with respect to such disability (but not with respect to any reoccurrence
of such a disability after such employee returns to active service with the
Company on or following the Closing Date). From and after the Closing Date,
any short-term disability obligations or right to reemployment for any
Acquired Employees who are on short-term or long-term disability as of
immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be the obligation of Buyer and its
Affiliates and not of Seller and its Affiliates. Seller shall cause the
accounts of the Acquired Employees in any Benefit Plan that is a 401(k) plan
to be fully vested as of immediately prior to the Closing Date. In addition,
Seller shall provide to each Acquired Employee matching contributions under
such Benefit Plan for the plan year that includes the Closing Date based on
the formulas set forth in such plan, but calculated without regard to any
annual service requirement imposed under such plan.

Section 8.3 No Third Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Article VIII
are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein
or elsewhere in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to:
(i) create a right in any employee, director, or individual independent
contractor of the Company or any other Person to employment or service with
the Company, Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates or restrict
in any way the rights of the Company, Seller, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates to terminate such individual's employment or service at any time
for any reason; (ii) limit the right of the Company, Seller, Buyer or their
respective Affiliates to amend or terminate any Buyer Plan or other Benefit
Plan; (iii) create any third-party rights, benefits or remedies of any nature
whatsoever in any employee, director or individual independent contractor of
the Company (or any of their beneficiaries or dependents thereof) or any other
Person that is not party of this Agreement; or (iv) be treated as establishing
or amending any employee benefit plan or arrangement of the Company, Seller,
Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates.

ARTICLE IX 
INDEMNIFICATION



Section 9.1 Indemnification.

(a) Indemnification by Seller.

(i) From and after the Closing, Seller will indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Buyer, its Affiliates (including the Company), and each of their
respective shareholders, partners, members, managers, officers, directors,
employees, attorneys, agents and representatives (collectively, the "Buyer
Indemnified Group"), from and against any and all Losses (including Third
Party Claims) which arise out of, or are attributable to, the following
(collectively, "Buyer Claims"):

(1) any breach of any covenant, obligation or agreement of Seller set forth in
this Agreement;

(2) any breach of (i) the Seller Fundamental Representations made by Seller in
Article III, (ii) the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in
Section 3.15(i) and Section 3.15(m) (Tax Matters) or (iii) any certificates
delivered herewith as they relate to the representations and warranties
referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii); and

(3) any matters set forth in Section 9.1(a)(i)(3) of the Disclosure Schedule
(the "Pending Litigation");

(ii) In no event shall the maximum liability of Seller under Section
9.1(a)(i)(1) and Section 9.1(a)(i)(2) exceed the Base Purchase Price.

(iii) Any Buyer Claim that can be brought under the RandW Policy or Section
9.1(a)(i)(1) as a result of Seller taking or failing to take actions set forth
in Section 7.1 shall first be brought as a Buyer Claim under the RandW Policy;
provided, however, that, to the extent the Losses relating to such Buyer Claim
(A) are determined by the insurer to be outside the scope of coverage under
the RandW Policy or (B) remain after all applicable coverage limits under the
RandW Policy have been exhausted, Buyer shall be entitled to bring such Buyer
Claim against Seller under Section 9.1(a)(i)(1) to the extent of such Losses
(excluding the amount of any Losses recovered under the RandW Policy, if any),
subject to the limitations specified in Section 9.1(a)(ii).

(b) Indemnification by Buyer.

(i) From and after the Closing, Buyer will indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Seller, its Affiliates, and each of their respective shareholders, partners,
members, managers, officers, directors, employees, attorneys, agents and
representatives (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Group"), from and
against any and all Losses (including Third Party Claims) which arise out of,
or are attributable to, the following (collectively, "Seller Claims"):



(1) any breach of any covenant, obligation or agreement of Buyer set forth in
this Agreement; and

(2) any breach of any of the representations or warranties made by Buyer in
Article IV or in any certificates delivered in connection herewith.

(ii) Absent intentional fraud, the maximum liability of Buyer for
indemnification under Section 9.1(b)(i) shall not exceed the Base Purchase
Price.

(c) For purposes of determining both (i) whether or not there is a breach of,
or any inaccuracy or misrepresentation with respect to any representation or
warranty for which indemnification would be available under Section
9.1(a)(i)(2) or Section 9.1(b)(i)(2), and (ii) the amount of any Losses
resulting from such breach, inaccuracy or misrepresentation, all
qualifications in such representation or warranty to "materiality" or
"Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualification shall be disregarded.

(d) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and upon a receipt of notice of the
assertion of a claim or of the commencement of an Action that is a Third Party
Claim against any member of the Buyer Indemnified Group or the Seller
Indemnified Group for Losses subject to indemnification under Section 9.1(a)
or Section 9.1(b), respectively, such Person entitled to indemnification
hereunder (the "Indemnitee") will promptly notify the Party against which
indemnification is sought (the "Indemnitor") in writing of any Loss that has
given or could give rise to a claim under Section 9.1(a) or Section 9.1(b).
Such written notice is herein referred to as a "Notice of Claim." A Notice of
Claim will specify, in reasonable detail, the facts known to the Indemnitee
regarding the claim, and the Indemnitee shall provide any other information
with respect thereto as the Indemnitor may reasonably request. Subject to the
terms of this Agreement, the failure to provide (or timely provide) a Notice
of Claim will not affect the Indemnitee's rights to indemnification except to
the extent that, as a result of such failure, the Indemnitor was prejudiced.

(e) The Indemnitor may elect to defend, in good faith and at its expense, any
claim or demand set forth in a Notice of Claim relating to a Third Party
Claim. The Indemnitee, at its expense, may participate in the defense of any
such Third Party Claim (other than the Pending Litigation) with counsel of its
choosing. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of a Notice of Claim, the
Indemnitor must notify the Indemnitee in writing as to whether the Indemnitor
is proceeding with the defense of the Third Party Claim. If the Indemnitor
does not so notify the Indemnitee that the Indemnitor is proceeding with the
defense of the Third Party Claim that relates to any Losses indemnified
against hereunder or the Indemnitor refuses or is refusing to defend such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall undertake its defense, and the
Indemnitor shall, after receipt of evidence thereof, reimburse the Indemnitee
for all reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such
defense; provided, however, that the Indemnitor shall not be required to pay
for more than one such counsel for all Indemnitees in connection with any
Third Party Claim. Without the prior written consent of the other Party, no
Party will enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim unless (i) the
settlement includes a complete and unconditional release of the other Party
and its Group (i.e., the Seller Indemnified Group or the Buyer



Indemnified Group, as the case may be) with respect to the Third Party Claim,
(ii) as a result of such settlement, no injunctive or other equitable relief
would be imposed against the other Party and (iii) the Party entering into
such settlement shall bear any and all costs and expenses with respect to such
settlement. This Section 9.1(e) shall not apply to Tax Contests, which are
instead governed by Section 10.2(f). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in
the defense and settlement of any Third Party Claim by a Governmental Entity
alleging any criminal acts under Applicable Law, and the Indemnitor shall,
after receipt of evidence thereof, reimburse the Indemnitee for all reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such defense; provided,
however, that the Indemnitor shall not be required to pay for more than one
such counsel for all Indemnitees in connection with such Third Party Claim.

(f) The Party defending the Third Party Claim will (i) consult with the other
Party throughout the pendency of the Third Party Claim regarding the
investigation, defense, settlement, trial, appeal or other resolution of the
Third Party Claim, and (ii) afford the other Party the reasonable opportunity
to participate, at the expense of the other Party, in the defense of the Third
Party Claim. Each Party will make available to the other Party or its
representatives all records and other materials reasonably required by them
for use in contesting any Third Party Claim (subject to obtaining an agreement
to maintain the confidentiality of confidential or proprietary materials in a
form reasonably acceptable to Indemnitor and Indemnitee). The Parties will
cooperate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, including, if requested by
a Party, contesting any Third Party Claim that a Party elects to contest or,
if appropriate, in making any counterclaim against the Person asserting the
claim or demand, or any cross-complaint against any Person. The requesting
Party will reimburse the other Party for any expenses incurred by the other
Party in cooperating with or acting at the request of the requesting Party.
This Section 9.1(f) shall not apply to the Pending Litigation.

(g) Any direct claim will be asserted by giving the Indemnitor reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, stating the nature of such claim in reasonable
detail and indicating the estimated amount, if practicable, after the
Indemnitee becomes aware of such direct claim, but the failure to give timely
notice will not affect the rights or obligations of the Indemnitor except to
the extent that, as a result of such failure, the Indemnitor was materially
prejudiced.

Section 9.2 Payment. In the event that a Party is required to make an
indemnity payment under this Agreement, such Indemnitor shall pay the
Indemnitee the amount so determined within five (5) Business Days following an
agreement between Buyer and Seller or other final determination that an
indemnity amount is payable (which in the case of litigation which is not
settled pursuant to mutual agreement of the Parties shall be the final order
of a court of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal can be taken or the
time for appeal from which has run).

Section 9.3 Exclusive Remedy. Following the Closing, except in the case of
intentional fraud or as provided in Section 12.5, the right of each Indemnitee
to assert indemnification claims and receive indemnity payments under this
Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive right and



remedy exercisable by such Indemnitee with respect to any Loss or other claims
arising out of this Agreement, or related in any way to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. No Indemnitee shall have any other remedy
(statutory, common law or otherwise) against an Indemnitor with respect
thereto, all such other remedies hereby being waived.

Section 9.4 Purchase Price Adjustment. Any payment made pursuant to this
Article IX or Article X shall be treated as an adjustment to the Final
Purchase Price for applicable federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes,
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.

Section 9.5 Survival. All representations and warranties of the Parties
contained in this Agreement shall not survive the Closing Date; except that
(A) the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Section 3.15(i)
and Section 3.15(m) (Tax Matters) shall survive the Closing Date until thirty
(30) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
with respect to the particular matter that is the subject matter thereof; (B)
the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Section 3.1
(Organization and Good Standing), Section 3.2(a) (Authorization), Section
3.2(b)(i) (No Conflicts), Section 3.3 (Enforceability), Section 3.4
(Capitalization and Ownership) and Section 3.22 (Financial Advisors) shall
survive the Closing Date indefinitely (the representations set forth in
Section 3.1, Section 3.2(a), Section 3.2(b)(i), Section 3.3, Section 3.4 and
Section 3.22 are collectively referred to herein as the "Seller Fundamental
Representations"); and (C) the representations and warranties of Buyer set
forth in Section 4.1 (Organization and Good Standing), Section 4.2(a)
(Authorization), Section 4.2(b)(i) (No Conflicts), Section 4.3
(Enforceability) and Section 4.6 (Financial Advisors) shall survive the
Closing Date indefinitely (the representations set forth in Section 4.1,
Section 4.2(a), Section 4.2(b)(i), Section 4.3 and Section 4.6 are
collectively referred to herein as the "Buyer Fundamental Representations").
The pre-Closing covenants of Seller shall survive the Closing Date for a
period of six (6) months. All covenants and agreements of the Parties which
are intended to be performed in whole or in part following the Closing shall
survive until such covenants and agreements are fully performed in accordance
with their terms.

Section 9.6 Mitigation.

(a) An Indemnitee will use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any
Losses subject to indemnification hereunder, including commercially reasonable
efforts to recover all such Losses from insurers of such Indemnitee under
applicable insurance policies (subject to the terms of Section 9.6(b)) so as
to reduce the amount of any such Losses hereunder.

(b) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification hereunder will be
reduced to the extent of any insurance proceeds or other payments actually
received from an insurer or other third party with respect to such Loss, net
of all costs of recovery (including any documented resulting increase in the
cost of insurance, and any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with such recovery (including any Taxes payable
thereon)). If the amount of any Loss, at any time subsequent to the making of
an indemnity payment in respect thereof, is reduced by recovery, settlement,
or payment under or pursuant to any insurance coverage or by recovery,
settlement, or payment by or against any other Person, the amount of such
reduction (net of all costs of recovery, including any



documented increases in the cost of insurance), will be repaid by the
Indemnitee to the Indemnitor reasonably promptly following actual receipt or
credit of such amounts.

(c) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification hereunder will be
reduced to the extent that the Indemnitee received a benefit from the
reflection of such matter in the calculation of the adjustment to the Final
Purchase Price, if any, as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.3.

Section 9.7 No Punitive Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, no Party shall, in any event, be liable to any
other Person for any special or punitive damages, except to the extent such
damages are included within a judgment rendered against the Indemnitee with
respect to a Third Party Claim for which indemnification is available
hereunder.

Section 9.8 Order of Recovery. Buyer agrees (including on behalf of each other
member of the Buyer Indemnified Group) that the members of the Buyer
Indemnified Group shall, with respect to claims under Section 9.1(a)(i)(2) and
Section 10.3, (i) first, to the extent the Losses are covered under the RandW
Policy, recover against the RandW Policy until the remaining limits thereunder
have been exhausted, and (ii) thereafter, recover from Seller (subject, in all
instances, to the limitations set forth in this Article IX, including Section
9.1(a)).

ARTICLE X 
TAXES

Section 10.1 Transfer Taxes. Any sales, use, transfer, stock transfer, stamp
taxes, any transfer, recording, filing, registration and other fees, and any
other similar Taxes, but excluding any Taxes on or with respect to income,
profits or gains (the "Transfer Taxes"), if any, which become payable as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than the
Conversion, shall be borne and paid by Buyer. Buyer, at its own expense, will
file, to the extent required by Applicable Law, all necessary documentation
and Tax Returns with respect to all such Transfer Taxes (except to the extent
such Tax Returns are required by Applicable Law to be filed by Seller), and,
if required by Applicable Law, Seller will join in the execution of any such
documentation and will take such positions therein as are reasonably requested
by Buyer and will promptly supply any information in its possession that is
reasonably necessary to complete such documentation or Tax Returns. Seller and
Buyer agree to cooperate in the execution and delivery of all instruments and
certificates reasonably necessary to minimize the amount of any Transfer Taxes
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.

Section 10.2 Taxes and Tax Returns.

(a) Except to the extent accrued as a liability reflected in Closing Net
Working Capital as contained in the Final Purchase Price, all Taxes on or with
respect to the Company that are attributable to any taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date shall be the responsibility of
Seller. All Taxes on or with respect to the Company that are (i) attributable
to any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing
Date, to the extent accrued as a liability reflected in Closing Net Working
Capital as contained



in the Final Purchase Price, or (ii) attributable to any taxable period (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, shall be the responsibility
of Buyer.

(b) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Income Tax Returns for
the Company that relate to any United States federal or state consolidated,
combined or unitary group that includes Seller or an Affiliate of Seller
(other than the Company) (such Income Tax Returns, "Combined Income Tax
Returns"). Seller shall pay (or cause to be paid) all Taxes due and owing by
the Company with respect to such Combined Income Tax Returns. Except for
Combined Income Tax Returns, Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared all
Tax Returns for the Company that relate to any taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date (such Tax Returns, the "Seller
Tax Returns") which are filed after the Closing Date. At least ten (10)
Business Days (or five (5) Business Days in the case of non-Income Tax
Returns) prior to the date such Tax Return is required to be filed, Seller
shall provide to Buyer a copy of each Seller Tax Return which is to be filed
after the Closing Date for Buyer's review, reasonable comment and approval
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Buyer will be
deemed to have granted its approval, if Buyer has not responded by three (3)
Business Days following receipt. Not later than three (3) days prior to the
due date for the payment of Taxes on any Seller Tax Returns, Seller shall pay
or cause to be paid to Buyer the amount of Taxes for any portion of a taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date, except to the extent accrued as a
liability reflected in Closing Net Working Capital as contained in the Final
Purchase Price. Buyer shall timely pay or cause to be paid all Taxes reported
to be due on Seller Tax Returns required to be filed pursuant to this Section
10.2(b). For the avoidance of doubt, (i) Seller shall not be required to
deliver any Combined Income Tax Return to Buyer and (ii) Buyer shall not be
required to deliver any Tax Return of Buyer to Seller for its review and
comment.

(c) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Tax Returns for the Company, other than the Tax Returns which Seller shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, pursuant to Section 10.2(b).

(d) Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any Tax refunds actually realized in cash
(or a reduction in Taxes actually realized as a result of an offset or credit
against Taxes in lieu of a Tax refund, a "Tax Credit") of the Company with
respect to taxable periods (or portions thereof) of the Company ending on or
before the Closing Date within ten (10) days after receipt by Buyer or the
Company (or any of their respective Affiliates) of such Tax refunds or, if a
Tax Credit, the filing of any Tax Return utilizing such Tax Credit, net of any
Taxes or other out of pocket cost or expenses incurred by Buyer or the Company
(or any of their respective Affiliates) in connection with the receipt of such
Tax refund or Tax Credit, except to the extent such Tax refund or Tax Credit
was accrued as an asset (or used to reduce a Liability) reflected in Closing
Net Working Capital as contained in the Final Purchase Price. If a Taxing
Authority subsequently disallows any amount of such Tax refund or Tax Credit,
Seller shall promptly pay to the Company, upon written notice by Buyer, the
amount of the Tax refund or Tax Credit that was disallowed by the Taxing
Authority.



(e) For purposes of this Section 10.2(e), in the case of any Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion
of such Tax that relates to the portion of such taxable period ending on the
Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any ad valorem Taxes, be deemed to be
the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the taxable period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire taxable period and in the case of all other Taxes
shall be determined on an interim closing of the books of the Company as of
the close of business on the Closing Date; and (ii) except to the extent
accrued as a Liability reflected in Closing Net Working Capital as contained
in the Final Purchase Price, be the obligation of Seller, who shall pay over
such Taxes to Buyer in accordance with Section 10.2(b). Buyer shall be liable
for all other Straddle Period Taxes and shall pay such Taxes when due in
accordance with Section 10.2(b). Any credits relating to a taxable period that
begins before and ends after the Closing Date shall be taken into account as
though the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date. All
determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be
made in a manner consistent with past practices of the Company and shall be in
conformity with the Code and any other applicable authorities except to the
extent required by any Applicable Laws.

(f) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith with each other, fully and
promptly, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with (i) the preparation and filing of Tax Returns ("Tax
Preparation") of the Company and (ii) any suit, action, inquiry, proceeding,
administrative or judicial appeal, audit, litigation or other similar
proceeding with respect to Taxes of the Company (a "Tax Contest"). Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party's request)
the provision of records and information reasonably relevant to any such Tax
Contest and making employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Seller and Buyer agree to retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until expiration of the statute of
limitations (and any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods,
and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing
Authority. Buyer shall promptly notify Seller upon receipt by Buyer or its
Affiliates of notice of any pending or threatened Tax Contest which may affect
the Tax Liabilities or indemnification obligations hereunder of Seller or the
Company in respect of taxable periods or portions thereof ending on or prior
to the Closing Date. Seller shall have the sole right, at its expense, to
represent all interests in any such Tax Contest which could affect the Tax
Liabilities or indemnification obligations hereunder of Seller or Seller's
Affiliates, and to employ counsel of its choice in such Tax Contest; provided,
however, that if the Tax Contest would reasonably be expected to affect the
Tax Liabilities or indemnification obligations hereunder of Buyer or any of
Buyer's Affiliates (including the Company with respect to Taxes that are not
required to be indemnified by Seller hereunder), Buyer shall be entitled to
participate in such Tax Contest, Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed
of any material developments relating to such Tax Contest, and Buyer's written
consent shall be required prior to the settlement of any such Tax Contest,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Buyer shall cooperate



fully with Seller and its counsel in the defense against or compromise of any
claim in any such Tax Contest. Buyer shall have the sole right, at its
expense, to represent all interests in any other Tax Contest involving the
Company, and to employ counsel of its choice in such Tax Contest.

(g) Upon written request of Seller, Buyer shall file, or cause to be filed,
any amended Tax Return of the Company or claim for Tax refund on behalf of the
Company and for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date,
provided that taking such position will not subject either Buyer, the Company,
or any of their Affiliates to additional Taxes or reduce any Tax asset or Tax
attribute of Buyer or the Company. Buyer shall permit Seller to review and
comment on such amended Tax Return prior to filing and Buyer shall incorporate
Seller's reasonable comments. The cost of preparing such amended Tax Return
requested by Seller shall be borne by Seller. Except to the extent accrued as
an asset (or used to reduce a Liability) reflected in Closing Net Working
Capital as contained in the Final Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay to Seller
any Tax refund received with respect to such amended Tax Return, net of any
Taxes and any other reasonable costs incurred by Buyer under this Section
10.2(g), within five (5) days after receipt by Buyer or the Company.

(h) Buyer covenants that without the prior written consent of Seller (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Buyer shall not, and shall
not cause or permit its Affiliates (including the Company) to, make, change or
revoke any Tax election, amend any Tax Return, take any Tax position on any
Tax Return, or compromise or settle any Tax Liability, in each case if such
action would reasonably be expected to have the effect of increasing the Tax
Liability of the Company or Seller (or any of its Affiliates) in respect of
any taxable period (or portion thereof) of the Company ending on or before the
Closing Date.

Section 10.3 Tax Indemnities.

(a) Except to the extent accrued as a liability reflected in Closing Net
Working Capital as contained in the Final Purchase Price, Seller shall be
responsible for and shall indemnify and hold the Company and Buyer harmless
against (i) all Taxes imposed on or payable by the Company for any taxable
period (or portion thereof) that ends on or before the Closing Date; (ii) with
respect to any Straddle Period, all Taxes imposed on or payable by the Company
which are allocable pursuant to Section 10.2(e) to the portion of such period
ending on the Closing Date; (iii) all Taxes for which the Company is held
liable by reason of the Company being included in any consolidated or
affiliated group with Seller (or any Affiliates of Seller) (within the meaning
of Section 1504(a) of the Code or any similar group defined under a similar
provision of state, local or foreign law) at any time on or before the Closing
Date, including under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6; and (iv) all Taxes
of any Person other than the Company imposed on the Company as a transferee,
indemnitor, or successor, by Contract (other than a Contract the primary
subject matter of which is not Taxes) or pursuant to any Tax law, which Taxes
relate to an event or transaction occurring on or before the Closing Date. For
the avoidance of doubt, no indemnity payment made under this Section 10.3(a)
shall be subject to any cap, deductible or other limitation.



(b) Buyer shall be responsible for all Taxes imposed on or payable by the
Company that are not otherwise specified in Section 10.3(a).

(c) Payment by the indemnifying party of any amount due under Section 10.3(a)
shall be made at the time and in the manner specified in Section 10.2(e);
provided, that in the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance with the
provisions of Section 10.2(f), payment of the Tax to the appropriate Taxing
Authority will be considered to be due no earlier than the date a final
determination to such effect is made by the appropriate Taxing Authority or
court.

Section 10.4 Miscellaneous Tax Matters.

(a) For purposes of this Article X, all references to Buyer, Seller,
Affiliates, and the Company include successors and permitted assigns.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained in this Article X
shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force until sixty (60) days
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for the
Taxes in question (taking into account any extensions or waivers thereof).

Section 10.5 Purchase Price Allocation. The Parties agree that the Final
Purchase Price (plus any Liabilities of the Company or other amounts properly
taken into account as consideration for applicable Tax purposes) shall be
allocated among the Company's assets for U.S. federal income Tax purposes
(and, where applicable, state and local income Tax purposes) in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder and any similar provision of state, local or foreign law, as
appropriate. Seller shall provide Buyer with a schedule detailing such
allocation within ninety (90) days following the date the Final Purchase Price
is finally determined pursuant to Section 2.3 (the "Section 1060 Allocation
Schedule") and the parties shall use reasonable efforts to agree upon such
schedule. If the Section 1060 Allocation Schedule has been agreed, the Parties
shall prepare and file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Section
1060 Allocation Schedule, unless otherwise required by a Taxing Authority. The
Parties shall notify one another promptly in the event a Taxing Authority
challenges a previously agreed Section 1060 Allocation Schedule. In the event
that any subsequent adjustment to the Final Purchase Price occurs as a result
of any indemnity payments made pursuant to this Agreement or for any other
reason, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to agree to a revised
Section 1060 Allocation Schedule prepared in such manner as shall be
consistent with the original Section 1060 Allocation Schedule but taking into
account such subsequent adjustment.

Section 10.6 Tax Sharing Agreements Terminated. The Company shall cause any
Tax sharing, Tax allocation, Tax indemnity and other similar agreements
between the Company, on the one hand, and Seller and any of its Affiliates, on
the other hand, to be terminated prior to the Closing, in a manner that does
not result in any remaining Tax or other Liability for which Buyer or the
Company would be responsible after Closing.



ARTICLE XI 
TERMINATION

Section 11.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing solely as follows:

(a) by Seller or Buyer, if the Closing has not occurred for whatever reason by
5:00 p.m., Central time, on the Termination Date (unless extended in writing
by the Parties) provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 11.1(a) shall not be available to a Party if the failure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated prior to the
Termination Date was primarily due to the failure of such Party to perform or
comply with, in all material respects, any of the covenants or agreements to
be performed or complied with by such Party under this Agreement prior to the
Closing;

(b) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

(c) by Buyer or Seller, if any competent Governmental Entity shall have issued
an Order, decree or ruling or taken any other action which permanently enjoins
or prevents or otherwise prohibits the acquisition by Buyer of the Membership
Interests and such Order, decree, ruling or other Action shall have become
final and nonappealable; provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 11.1(c) shall not be available to a Party if the imposition
of such legal restraint or the failure of such legal restraint to be resisted,
resolved or lifted was primarily due to the failure of such Party to perform
or comply with, in all material respects, any of the covenants or agreements
to be performed or complied with by such Party under this Agreement prior to
the Closing;

(d) by Seller, if Seller is not then in material breach of any provision of
this Agreement and there has been a material breach of, inaccuracy in or
failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of
Buyer under this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of satisfaction
of any of the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 on or prior to the Closing
Date (other than through Seller's failure to comply with its obligations under
this Agreement), and such breach, if curable, is not cured within 30 days
after receipt of written notice from Seller (or any shorter period of time
that remains between the date Seller provided such written notice of such
breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform and the Termination Date);

(e) by Buyer, if Buyer is not then in material breach of any provision of this
Agreement and there has been a material breach of, inaccuracy in or failure to
perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Seller under
this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of satisfaction of any of
the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 on or prior to the Closing Date (other
than through Buyer's failure to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement), and such breach, if curable, is not cured within 30 days after
receipt of written notice from Buyer (or any shorter period of time that
remains between the date Buyer provided such written notice of such breach,
inaccuracy or failure to perform and the Termination Date); or



(f) by Seller, if (i) the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 are satisfied,
(ii) Seller delivers to Buyer an irrevocable written notice on or after the
date that the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 6.1 that all
conditions set forth in Section 5.1 have been satisfied or waived and Seller
is ready, willing and able to proceed with the Closing in accordance with this
Agreement and (iii) within five (5) Business Days after Seller's delivery of
such notice to Buyer (or, if sooner, the Termination Date), Buyer fails to
deliver the Closing Purchase Price in accordance with this Agreement to
consummate the Closing; provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 11.1(f) shall not be available to Seller in the event Buyer
has notified Seller that Buyer will cause the Closing to occur on or prior to
the expiration of such five (5) Business Day period (or, if sooner, the
Termination Date) and Buyer fulfils its obligations hereunder to cause the
Closing to occur within such time period.

Section 11.2 Effect of Termination; Termination Fee.

(a) Upon a termination of this Agreement by a Party pursuant to Section 11.1,
then such Party shall promptly give notice to the other Party specifying the
provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and upon delivery
of such notice this Agreement shall become void and have no effect, other than
each Party's obligations under Section 7.5 (Public Announcements), Section 7.6
(Confidentiality), Article XI (Termination) and Article XII (Miscellaneous),
each of which shall survive the termination hereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, subject to Section 11.2(b), nothing in this Section 11.2 shall be
deemed to release any Party from any Liability for any intentional breach or
intentional fraud by such Party of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
occurring before such termination.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Seller pursuant to Section 11.1(d),
(ii) by Buyer or Seller pursuant to Section 11.1(a) or Section 11.1(c), in
each case, at a time when all conditions set forth in Article V are satisfied
(other than the conditions set forth in Section 5.1(c) and/or Section 5.1(e)
and Section 5.2(d) and/or Section 5.2(f) solely as a result of Calpine
Corporation or its Subsidiaries' acquisition of (or agreement to acquire) any
assets, property or securities related to retail natural gas marketing between
the date hereof and the Closing), or (iii) by Seller pursuant to Section
11.1(f), then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer
hereby agrees to pay promptly to Seller, and in any event within five (5)
Business Days of delivery of the notice of termination contemplated by Section
11.2(a), as liquidated damages (and not a penalty) in connection with any such
termination, in immediately available funds to one or more accounts specified
by Seller, an amount equal to $20,000,000 (the "Termination Fee"). The
provisions for the payment of the Termination Fee in this Section 11.2(b) have
been included because, in the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant
to the first sentence of this Section 11.2(b), the actual damages to be
incurred by Seller would be difficult if not impossible to measure precisely.
Buyer acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 11.2(b) are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by the
other Transaction Documents, or any Action, based on, in respect of, or by
reason of any of the foregoing. The Parties acknowledge and agree that payment
of the Termination Fee and such other amounts payable (if any) pursuant to
Section 7.15(c) and any Enforcement Expenses (in



each case, to the extent due and subject to the Expenses Cap) by or on behalf
of Buyer shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Seller, the
Company, and their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates and Representatives
against Buyer, the Buyer Guarantor and their Affiliates and Representatives
for any matter under, relating to or arising out of, the termination of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document, whether based on Contract, tort,
strict liability, other Applicable Laws or otherwise, or any Action, based on,
in respect of, or by reason of any of the foregoing. Upon payment of the
Termination Fee and such other amounts payable hereunder (if any) pursuant to
Section 7.15(c) and any Enforcement Expenses (in each case, to the extent due
and subject to the Expenses Cap), none of Buyer, Buyer Guarantor or their
Affiliates and Representatives shall have any Liability or obligation, and
Seller, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates and
Representatives shall not otherwise file any Action, for any matter under,
relating to or arising out of, the termination of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, whether based on Contract, tort, strict liability, other
Applicable Laws or otherwise, or any Action, based on, in respect of, or by
reason of any of the foregoing. If Buyer fails to promptly pay the Termination
Fee when due (A) Buyer shall additionally pay to Seller interest on the amount
of the Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to be made
until the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate for
commercial loans as published by the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date
of termination and (B) if, in order to obtain such payment, Seller commences
an Action that results in a judgment against Buyer, Buyer shall reimburse
Seller for its reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented external attorneys' fees and expenses and other out-
of-pocket costs and expenses paid to independent third parties) incurred in
connection with such Action (such amounts payable under the foregoing clauses
(A) and (B), collectively, the "Enforcement Expenses"); provided, that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the aggregate
amount of all amounts to be paid by Buyer pursuant to Section 7.15(c) and the
Enforcement Expenses shall not exceed in the aggregate $2,000,000 (the
"Expenses Cap"). In no event shall the aggregate amount of (A) Buyer's and
Buyer Guarantor's aggregate Liability upon a termination of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents, whether by payment of the Termination Fee or
other damages, exceed an amount equal to the Termination Fee plus any amounts
due pursuant to Section 7.15(c) and any Enforcement Expenses (in each case, to
the extent due and subject to the Expenses Cap) and (B) Seller's aggregate
Liability upon a termination of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents exceed an amount equal to $22,000,000.

(c) Prior to any termination of this Agreement, Seller shall be entitled to
pursue specific performance as provided in Section 12.5; provided, that the
Parties acknowledge and agree that under no circumstance shall (i) Seller or
the Company be entitled to receive both payment of the Termination Fee in
accordance with Section 11.2(b) and specific performance pursuant to Section
12.5 and (ii) Buyer (or the Buyer Guarantor under the Buyer Guaranty) be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

Section 12.5 Specific Performance.

(a) Subject to Section 12.5(b), each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees
that the other Party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
covenants of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties
agrees that the other Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent non-performance or breaches of the covenants of this



Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof. In the event of any action to enforce this Agreement
specifically pursuant to this Section 12.5, each Party hereby waives the
defense that there is an adequate remedy at law or that the other Party must
prove actual damages and agrees further to waive any requirement for the
security or posting of any bond in connection with any such equitable remedy.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including
Section 12.5(a), it is acknowledged and agreed by the Parties that Seller
shall be entitled to specific performance of Buyer's obligations prior to the
Closing to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the
Closing in accordance with this Agreement, including Section 6.1, only in the
event that (and only if and for so long as) each of the following conditions
has been satisfied: (i) all of the applicable conditions set forth in Section
5.2 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
Closing, but only to the extent such conditions would be satisfied if the
Closing were to occur at such time) have been satisfied or waived by the
applicable Party and Buyer fails to consummate the Closing by the date the
Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 6.1; (ii) the
applicable Financing Sources have confirmed in writing that the Debt Financing
has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is
also funded at the Closing on the terms set forth in the applicable Debt
Commitment Letter; (iii) Seller has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice
delivered to Buyer that if specific performance is granted and the Financing
is funded, Seller stands ready, willing and able to timely consummate the
Closing; and (iv) Seller has not terminated this Agreement in accordance with
Section 11.1. Under no circumstances shall Buyer be obligated to both
specifically perform the terms of this Agreement and pay any monetary damages,
in the form of a Termination Fee or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that in the event Seller exercises its right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1, then Seller shall not have
the right to specific performance, an injunction or other equitable remedy
under this Agreement, including pursuant to this Section 12.5(b), with respect
to such termination and failure of the Closing to occur. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the election to pursue an injunction or specific
performance shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit Seller from, in the
alternative, seeking to terminate this Agreement and collect the Termination
Fee under Section 11.2(b).

Section 12.6 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto and thereto, the Confidentiality Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents contain the entire understanding and agreement between the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof or thereof and supersede and cancel
any and all prior agreements between the Parties as to the matters covered
herein or therein. There are no agreements, understandings, representations,
or warranties between the Parties other than those set forth or referred to
herein or therein.

Section 12.7 Assignment. No Party hereto may assign this Agreement or its
rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other
Party, which consent may be granted or withheld in such other Party's sole
discretion and any attempted assignment in contravention of the foregoing
shall be null and void; provided, however, that (i) Buyer may assign any or
all of its rights hereunder solely for collateral security purposes in
connection with any Debt



Financing to any Financing Sources (it being understood and agreed that such
assignment shall not relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations
hereunder) and (ii) Buyer may assign its rights, interests and obligations
hereunder, in each case, without the consent of Seller, to an Affiliate (it
being understood and agreed that such assignment shall not relieve the
assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder).

Section 12.8 Amendments. No amendment, modification or change to this
Agreement will be enforceable unless reduced to writing and executed by duly
authorized Representatives of all Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, Section 4.7, Section 7.15, Section 9.7,
Section 12.3, Section 12.4, Section 12.14, Section 12.15 and this Section 12.8
(and any other provision of this Agreement to the extent such amendment,
supplement, waiver or other modification of such provision would modify the
substance of such Sections) may not be amended, supplemented, waived or
otherwise modified in any manner that impacts or otherwise is adverse in any
respect to (a) the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the
Financing Sources and (b) the Buyer Financing Sources (if any) without the
prior written consent of the Buyer Financing Sources.

Section 12.9 Severability. This Agreement is intended to be performed in
accordance with, and only to the extent permitted by, all Applicable Laws. If
any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or
circumstance, is for any reason or to any extent invalid or unenforceable, the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to the other
persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby, but rather is to be
enforced to the greatest extent permitted by Applicable Law, unless the
severance of any such provision from the remainder of this Agreement would
change the economic substance of the Agreement as a whole in a manner that is
materially adverse to any Party (and such change is not waived in writing by
such affected Person).

Section 12.10 No Implied Waivers. Except as expressly provided for herein, no
waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be effective
unless in writing and signed by the party against whom such waiver is sought
to be enforced. Any waiver of the terms hereof shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose given. The failure of a Party
to insist, in any instance, on the strict performance of any of the terms and
conditions hereof shall not be construed as a waiver of such Party's right in
the future to insist on such strict performance.

Section 12.11 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses, including fees and expenses of counsel and
accountants, incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such fee or expense,
except that Buyer shall bear and pay the costs and expenses (other than the
fees of and expenses of each Party's attorneys, which shall be borne by the
Party incurring such expense) incurred by the Parties in connection with the
filings of the premerger notification and report forms under the HSR Act and
other Antitrust Laws, including filing fees.

Section 12.12 No Joint Venture. Nothing contained in this Agreement creates or
is intended to create an association, trust, partnership, or joint venture or
impose a trust or partnership duty, obligation, or Liability on or with regard
to any Party.



Section 12.13 Joint Negotiation. This Agreement shall be considered for all
purposes as prepared through the joint efforts of the Parties, and shall not
be construed against one Party as a result of the preparation, submission or
other event of negotiation, drafting or execution hereof.

Section 12.14 No Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claim or suit based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be
brought against the Parties and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to the Parties, and no Person who is
not a Party, including any past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney, Financing Source (other than the Buyer Guarantor under the Buyer
Guaranty), Buyer Financing Sources, representative of Seller, Buyer, Company,
or any of their respective Affiliates (collectively, the "Non-Recourse
Parties"), will have or be subject to any Liability (whether in contract or in
tort) resulting from (nor will any such Persons have any claim with respect
to) any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or by the other Transaction Documents,
including any alleged non-disclosure or misrepresentations made by any such
Persons, in each case, regardless of the legal theory under which such
Liability may be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort,
or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise, and each Party waives and
releases all such Liabilities against any such Persons.

Section 12.15 Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, except as provided in Section 7.15 hereof and the
assertion by Buyer of express rights set forth in the (x) Debt Commitment
Letters or (y) any commitment letter relating to the Buyer Financing (if any),
(i) neither any Party nor any of its Affiliates, equityholders, members,
officers, directors, employees and representatives, nor any Person claiming
by, through or under any such Person, shall have any rights or claims against
any Financing Source or Buyer Financing Source in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the
other Transaction Documents or in respect of any oral representations made or
alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, including any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to (x) the Debt Commitment
Letters or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby or
(y) any Buyer Financing, in each case, whether at law or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise and (ii) no Financing Source or Buyer Financing Source
shall have any Liability (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to any
Party hereto or any of their respective Affiliates, equityholders, members,
officers, directors, employees and representatives, or any Person claiming by,
through or under any such Person for any Liabilities of any party hereto under
this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereunder or in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith, including any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to (x) the Debt Commitment
Letters or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby or
(y) any Buyer Financing, in each case, whether at law or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Financing Sources and Buyer Financing Sources shall each be
express third party beneficiaries of Section 4.7, Section 7.15, Section 9.7,
Section 12.3, Section 12.4, Section 12.8, Section 12.14, and this Section
12.15, and each of such Sections shall expressly inure to the benefit of each
of the Financing Sources and Buyer Financing Sources



and each of the Financing Sources and Buyer Financing Sources shall be
entitled to rely on and enforce the provisions of such Sections.

Section 12.16 Disclosure Generally. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in the Disclosure Schedule or in this Agreement, the information and
disclosures contained in any Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be
disclosed and incorporated by reference in any other Disclosure Schedule as
though fully set forth in such Disclosure Schedule for which applicability of
such information and disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face. The
disclosure of any item of information in any Disclosure Schedule shall not be
construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this
Agreement. Such information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall
not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material" or "Material
Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement.

Section 12.17 Legal Representation.

(a) Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company), acknowledges and agrees that Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer
and Feld LLP ("Akin Gump") has acted as counsel for Seller and the Company in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Acquisition Engagement"), and in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, Akin Gump has not acted as counsel for any
other Person, including Buyer.

(b) Only Seller, the Company and their respective Affiliates shall be
considered clients of Akin Gump in the Acquisition Engagement. Buyer, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company)
acknowledges and agrees that all confidential communications between Seller,
the Company and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and Akin Gump,
on the other hand, in the course of the Acquisition Engagement, and any
attendant attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection, and
expectation of client confidentiality applicable thereto, shall be deemed to
belong solely to Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company), and not
the Company, and shall not pass to or be claimed, held, or used by Buyer or
the Company upon or after the Closing. Accordingly, Buyer shall not have
access to any such communications, or to the files of Akin Gump relating to
the Acquisition Engagement, whether or not the Closing occurs. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) to
the extent that files of Akin Gump in respect of the Acquisition Engagement
constitute property of the client, only Seller and its Affiliates shall hold
such property rights and (ii) Akin Gump shall have no duty whatsoever to
reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to the
Company or Buyer by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Akin
Gump and the Company or otherwise; provided, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, Akin Gump shall not disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files to any third parties (other than representatives,
accountants and advisors of Seller and its Affiliates; provided, that such
representatives, accounts and advisors are instructed to maintain the
confidence of such attorney-client communications). Buyer, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company) irrevocably
waives any right it may have to discover or obtain information or
documentation relating to the Acquisition



Engagement, to the extent that such information or documentation was subject
to an attorney-client privilege, work product protection or other expectation
of confidentiality owed to Seller and/or its Affiliates. If and to the extent
that, at any time subsequent to Closing, Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including after the Closing, the Company) shall have the right to assert or
waive any attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication between
the Company or its Affiliates and any Person representing them that occurred
at any time prior to the Closing, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company) shall be entitled to
consent to such privilege and shall be entitled to waive such privilege only
with the prior written consent of Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld).

(c) Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the
Closing, the Company) expressly (i) consents to Akin Gump's representation of
Seller and/or its Affiliates and/or any of their respective agents (if any of
the foregoing Persons so desire) in any matter, including any post-Closing
matter in which the interests of Buyer and the Company, on the one hand, and
Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse and (ii)
consents to the disclosure by Akin Gump to Seller or its Affiliates of any
information learned by Akin Gump in the course of its representation of
Seller, the Company or their respective Affiliates, whether or not such
information is subject to attorney-client privilege, attorney work product
protection, or Akin Gump's duty of confidentiality.

(d) From and after the Closing, the Company shall cease to have any
attorney‑client relationship with Akin Gump, unless and to the extent Akin
Gump is expressly engaged in writing by the Company to represent the Company
after the Closing and either (i) such engagement involves no conflict of
interest with respect to Seller and/or any of its Affiliates or (ii) Seller
and/or any such Affiliate, as applicable, consent in writing to such
engagement. Any such representation of the Company by Akin Gump after the
Closing shall not affect the foregoing provisions hereof.

(e) Seller, the Company and Buyer consent to the arrangements in this Section
12.17 and waive any actual or potential conflict of interest that may be
involved in connection with any representation by Akin Gump permitted
hereunder.
