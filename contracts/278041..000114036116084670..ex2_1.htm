($18,000,000.00) (the " _Purchase Price_ "), which shall be paid as provided

_Closing_ ") shall occur following entry of the Sale Order by the Bankruptcy
Court approving the sale as provided in this Agreement and satisfaction or
waiver (in respect of any conditions that are subject to waiver) of the other
conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 9.1_ , _Section 9.2_ and _Section
9.3_ (the " _Closing Date_ "). The Closing shall take place at the offices of

Acquired Assets and any accrued expenses related to the Acquired Assets such
as amounts accrued to cover regulatory dry docking expenses (the " _Closing
Payment_ ") and Buyer and ISH shall direct the Escrow Agent to release the
full amount of the Deposit to Sellers. If Sellers are ready, willing and able
to proceed with the Closing and Buyer does not pay the Closing Payment, as
required herein, Sellers shall have no obligation to close the sale of the
Acquired Assets to Buyer as contemplated hereunder and Sellers may terminate
this Agreement as provided in _Section 12.1(d)_ , market the Acquired Assets
and enter into a purchase agreement with a third party and retain the Deposit.
In such case, Buyer relinquishes all rights to the Deposit.

Sellers against any person party to the Assigned Contract arising out of the
breach or cancellation thereof by such person; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after Closing, Buyer shall be responsible for all payment and other
obligations under, and for all costs of enforcing rights under, such Assigned
Contract to the same extent as if such Assigned Contract had been assigned.
Any assignment to Buyer of any Assigned Contract that shall, notwithstanding
the provisions of Sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, require the
consent or approval of any person for such assignment as aforesaid shall be
made subject to such consent or approval being obtained.
