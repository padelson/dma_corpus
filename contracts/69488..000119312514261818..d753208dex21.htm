17 Section 2.06 Purchase Price Adjustment.

 

(a) Closing Adjustment.

 

(i) At least three Business Days before the Closing, Scepter shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth its good faith estimate of Closing
Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing Working Capital"), which statement
shall contain an estimated balance sheet of Scepter as of the Effective Time
(without giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein) and a
calculation of the Estimated Closing Working Capital, substantially in the
form of Section 2.06(a)(i) of the Disclosure Schedules (the "Estimated Closing
Working Capital Statement"), and a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer
of Scepter that the Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement was prepared
in accordance with ASPE applied using the same accounting methods, practices,
principles, policies and procedures, in all material respects, with
consistent classifications, judgments and estimation methodologies that were
used in the preparation of the Audited Financial Statements for the most
recent fiscal year end.

 

(ii) The "Closing Adjustment" shall be an amount equal to the Estimated
Closing Working Capital minus CDN $17,763,000.00 (the "Target Working
Capital"). If the Closing Adjustment is a positive number, the Purchase Price
amount to be paid at Closing shall be increased by the amount of the Closing
Adjustment. If the Closing Adjustment is a negative number, the Purchase
Price amount to be paid at Closing shall be reduced by the amount of the
Closing Adjustment.

 

(b) Post-Closing Adjustment.

 

(i) As soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Scepter a statement setting forth its
calculation of Closing Working Capital, calculated in a manner consistent with
the Estimated Closing Working Capital, which statement shall also contain a
balance sheet of the Business as of the Effective Time (without giving effect
to the transactions contemplated herein) (the "Closing Working Capital
Statement") and a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of Buyer that the
Closing Working Capital Statement was prepared in accordance with
ASPE applied using the same accounting methods, practices, principles,
policies and procedures, in all material respects, with consistent
classifications, judgments and valuation and estimation methodologies that
were used in the preparation of the Audited Financial Statements for the most
recent fiscal year end.

(ii) The post-closing adjustment shall be an amount equal to the Closing
Working Capital minus the Estimated Closing Working Capital (the "Post-Closing
Adjustment"). If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive number, Buyer shall
pay to Scepter an amount equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment. If the Post-
Closing Adjustment is a negative number, Scepter shall pay to Buyer an amount
equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment.

 

(c) Examination and Review.

 

 __(i) _Examination._ After receipt of the Closing Working Capital Statement,
Scepter shall have 30 days (the " __Review Period __") to review the Closing
Working Capital Statement. During the Review Period, Scepter and Scepter s
Accountants shall be provided with full access to and the right to review and
copy the relevant books and records of Buyer, the personnel of, and the work
papers prepared by, __

 



18 _ _ Buyer and/or Buyers Accountants and full access to the personnel
responsible for such books, records and work papers, in all cases to the
extent that such books, records and work papers relate to the Closing Working
Capital Statement and to such historical financial information relating to the
Closing Working Capital Statement as Scepter may reasonably request for the
purpose of reviewing the Closing Working Capital Statement and to prepare a
Statement of Objections (defined below), _provided, that_ such access shall be
in a manner that does not materially or unreasonably interfere with the normal
business operations of Buyer. __

 

(ii) _Objection._ On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, Scepter
may object to the Closing Working Capital Statement by delivering to Buyer a
written statement setting forth Scepters objections in reasonable detail,
indicating each disputed item or amount and the basis for Scepters
disagreement therewith (the "Statement of Objections"). If Scepter fails to
deliver the Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review
Period, the Closing Working Capital Statement and the Post-Closing Adjustment,
as the case may be, reflected in the Closing Working Capital Statement
shall be deemed to have been accepted by Scepter. If Scepter delivers the
Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, Buyer and
Scepter shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such objections within 30
days after the delivery of the Statement of Objections (the "Resolution
Period"), and, if the same are so resolved within the Resolution Period, the
Post-Closing Adjustment and the Closing Working Capital Statement with such
changes as may have been previously agreed in writing by Buyer and Scepter,
shall be final and binding.

(iii) _Resolution of Disputes._ If Scepter and Buyer fail to reach an
agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in the Statement of
Objections before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any amounts
remaining in dispute ("Disputed Amounts" and any amounts not so disputed, the
"Undisputed Amounts") shall be submitted for resolution to the office of
Deloitte LLP or, if Deloitte LLP is unable to serve, Buyer and Scepter shall
appoint by mutual agreement the office of an impartial nationally recognized
firm of independent certified public accountants other than Scepters
Accountants or Buyers Accountants (the "Independent Accountants") who, acting
as experts and not arbitrators, shall resolve the Disputed Amounts only and
make any adjustments to the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, and
the Closing Working Capital Statement. The Parties agree that all adjustments
shall be made without regard to materiality. The Independent
Accountants shall only decide the specific items under dispute by the Parties
and their decision for each Disputed Amount must be within the range of values
assigned to each such item in the Closing Working Capital Statement and the
Statement of Objections, respectively.

(iv) _Fees of the Independent Accountants._ The terms of appointment and
engagement of the Independent Accountants shall be as agreed upon between
Buyer and Scepter based on reasonable and customary arrangements for such
services, and any associated fees shall initially be borne 50% by Buyer and
50% by Scepter; _provided_ such fees shall ultimately be allocated between
Buyer, on the one hand, and Scepter, on the

 



19  other hand, as follows: Scepter shall be responsible for a portion of the
fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants equal to 100% multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of Disputed Amounts submitted
to the Independent Accountants that are resolved in favor of Buyer (that being
the difference between the Independent Accountants determination and
Scepters determination) and the denominator of which is the total amount of
Disputed Amounts submitted to the Independent Accountants (that being the sum
total by which Buyers determination and Scepters determination differ from
the determination of the Independent Accountants). Buyer shall be responsible
for that portion of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants that
Scepter is not required to pay hereunder. Within ten (10) days of the
Independent Accountants determination of the Disputed Amounts in accordance
with this Section 2.06(c)(iv), each of Scepter and Buyer, as applicable shall
pay the other the amount required so that the allocation for responsibility
for the Independent Accountants fee is consistent with this Section
2.06(c)(iv).

(v) _Determination by Independent Accountants._ The Independent Accountants
shall be requested to make a determination as soon as practicable and in any
event within 30 days (or such other time as the Parties shall agree in
writing) after referral of the matter to such Independent Accountants, which
determination must be in writing and must set forth in reasonable detail, the
basis therefor. Buyer and Buyers Accountants shall each furnish to the
Independent Accountants such work papers and other documents and information
relating to the Disputed Amounts, and shall provide interviews and answer
questions, as such Independent Accountants may reasonably request. The
Independent Accountants resolution of the Disputed Amounts and their
adjustments to the Closing Working Capital Statement and/or the Post-Closing
Adjustment shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties.

(vi) _Payments of Post-Closing Adjustment._ Except as otherwise provided
herein, any payment of the Post-Closing Adjustment shall (A) be due (x)
within five Business Days of acceptance of the applicable Closing Working
Capital Statement or (y) if there are Disputed Amounts, then within five
Business Days of the resolution described in clause (v) above; and (B) be
paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as is
directed by Buyer or Scepter, as the case may be. Any payment of the Post-
Closing Adjustment owed by Scepter to Buyer shall be paid by the Escrow Agent
from the Working Capital Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. If payment of the Post-Closing Adjustment is owed by Scepter to
Buyer and the Post-Closing Adjustment is larger than the Working Capital
Escrow Amount, Scepter shall pay to Buyer the remainder of the Post-Closing
Adjustment that was not paid from the Working Capital Escrow Amount, such
payment to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account as directed by Buyer. In the event of any payment of the Post-Closing
Adjustment owing by Buyer to Scepter and there is a balance remaining of the
Working Capital Escrow Amount after any Post-Closing Adjustment paid pursuant
to the Eco One Purchase Agreement, forthwith upon such determination, the
Working Capital Escrow Amount shall also be released in its entirety together
with all accrued interest thereon by the Escrow Agent to Sellers and Buyer
shall timely cooperate and provide any written authorization or direction to
the Escrow Agent as prescribed under the Escrow Agreement to facilitate such
release.

 



20 (vii) _Conversion to US Dollars_. For purposes of this Section 2.06,
the Estimated Closing Working Capital, the Closing Working Capital, the
Closing Adjustment, the Post-Closing Adjustment, and the Target Working
Capital, all as initially determined in Canadian dollars, shall be converted
to US dollars using the exchange rate, as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ , as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

(d) Adjustments for Tax Purposes. Any payments made pursuant to Section 2.06
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price by the Parties for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

 

Section 2.07 Allocation of Purchase Price. Sellers and Buyer agree that the
Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities (plus other relevant items) shall
be allocated among the Purchased Assets for Tax purposes as shown on the
allocation schedule attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Allocation Schedule").
Any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.06 herein shall
be allocated in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule.

(a) maintain their corporate existence and hold the Rights, as bare trustees

such Action.

contemplated by this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Buyer will not: (a) be
insolvent (either because its financial condition is such that the sum of its
debts, including contingent and other liabilities, is greater than the fair
market value of its assets or because the fair saleable value of its assets is
less than the amount required to pay its probable liability on its existing
debts, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature); (b)

Projections. 

(a) Buyer acknowledges that, except for the representations and warranties of
Sellers expressly set forth in Article IV of this Agreement and in the
related Disclosure Schedules and any certificate delivered hereunder with
respect thereto, neither Seller, their respective Affiliates nor any other
Person acting on behalf of Sellers, or any of their respective Affiliates,
has made any representations or warranties, express or implied, to Buyer, and
that Sellers, their respective Affiliates and all other Persons acting on
behalf of Sellers and their respective Affiliates, have disclaimed any such
other representations or warranties.

(b) Buyer further acknowledges that, in connection with its investigation of
Sellers, it has received certain estimates, projections and forecasts,
including projected statements of operating revenues and income from
operations of the Business and certain budget and business plan information.
Buyer acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting
to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that Buyer
is familiar with such uncertainties and that Buyer is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it,
including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections and forecasts. Buyer acknowledges that, except as expressly
provided in this Agreement, Seller is not making any representations or
warranties, express or implied, with respect to any estimates, projections and
other forecasts, budgets and plans in respect of the Companies.

contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Buyers receipt of information pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall not
operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty or
agreement given or made by Sellers in this Agreement (including Section

supplement the Disclosure Schedules.

 

Section 6.05 Employees and Employee Benefits.

 

(a) Scepter shall provide the Buyer with an up-to-date list of the names of
all non-unionized Employees at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date, but conditional on the completion of
the Closing, the Buyer shall offer employment to all non-unionized Employees,
effective as at the day immediately following the Closing Date, but
conditional on the completion of the Closing, on terms and conditions which
are materially the same as those on which the non-unionized Employees were
employed by Scepter immediately prior to the Closing. All non-unionized
employees who accept the Buyers offer of employment shall be "Transferred
Employees". The Buyer shall recognize the length of service of each of the
Transferred Employees with Scepter for the period of his or her respective
employment with Scepter ending immediately prior to the Effective Time for
all purposes. The offers that the Buyer makes to all nonunionized Employees
shall expressly provide that the Buyer will recognize the past service of the
non-unionized Employees with Scepter for all purposes. On or before three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Buyer shall provide copies of the
offers to Scepter for Scepters review and approval prior to presenting the
offers to the non-unionized Employees.

 

(b) Subject to Section 2.03(c):

 

(i) Scepter shall be responsible for all liabilities and obligations with
respect to all Employees until the Effective Time, including,
without limitation, all liabilities and obligations relating to non-unionized
Employees who do not become Transferred Employees upon Closing; and

 



49 (ii) Buyer shall be responsible for all liabilities and obligations with
respect to the Transferred Employees from and after the Effective Time.

(c) Buyer confirms and acknowledges that it will be bound by the provisions
of the Collective Agreement from and after the Effective Time.

(d) Scepter shall employ all of the Employees set out in Section 6.05(d) of
the Disclosure Schedules until the Effective Time, except for any Employees
who prior to Closing:



     | (i) | are terminated for cause; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | are terminated with the Buyers consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | voluntarily resign; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | retire. 
---|---|--- 

(e) The Transferred Employees and the unionized Employees shall cease to be
eligible to join, and shall cease to accrue any further benefits under, the
Employee Plans from and after the Effective Time.

(f) The Buyer shall establish or offer retirement income and other benefit
plans (the "Replacement Benefit Plans"), to be effective at the Effective
Time. The Replacement Benefit Plans shall provide for the Transferred
Employees and the unionized Employees, in respect of their employment with
the Buyer from and after the Effective Time, benefits and on terms which are
materially the same as those provided to or in respect of the Transferred
Employees and the unionized Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time
under the comparable Employee Plans, and in accordance with the Collective
Agreement (in respect of the unionized Employees). The Buyer shall cause each
Replacement Benefit Plan to:

 



     | (i) | immediately, and without any waiting period, be available to
each Transferred Employee and unionized Employee who participate in the
comparable Employee Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time (and his
eligible dependents and beneficiaries) as of the day immediately following
the Closing Date; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | credit to each Transferred Employee or unionized Employee,
who is not covered by Section 6.05(f)(i) above, his period of employment with
the Sellers for the purpose of determining that Transferred Employee or
unionized Employees eligibility to participate in, and the vesting of
benefits under, the Replacement Benefit Plans; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | waive any limitation of coverage of a Transferred Employee
and unionized Employee (and his eligible dependents and beneficiaries) due to
pre-existing conditions; 
---|---|--- 
 



50 unionized Employee in respect of all deductible payments and co-payments made
by that Transferred Employee or unionized Employee, as the case may be, under
the Benefit Plans until the Effective Time for the purpose of determining the
extent to which such Transferred Employee or unionized Employee has satisfied
his deductible and whether he has reached the out-of-pocket maximum under the
comparable Replacement Benefit Plan, to the extent and in the manner that
those deductibles and co-payments are recognized under the comparable Benefit
Plan. 
---|---|--- 
 

(g) The Sellers and the Benefit Plans shall remain liable for all obligations
for benefit claims incurred under the Benefit Plans in respect of the
Transferred Employees and the unionized Employees for the period ending
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Section 6.05. For the purposes of this Section 6.05(g),
a benefit claim is deemed incurred, in the case of medical, vision or dental
benefits, when the services that are subject to the benefit claims are
performed; in the case of life insurance, when the death occurs; in the case
of disability benefits, when the disability occurs; and in the case of
accidental death and dismemberment, when the event giving rise to the benefits
occurs; and in respect of a benefit claim recurring after the Effective Time,
the Sellers and the Benefit Plans are liable for that recurring benefit claim
only if the recurring benefit plan constitutes a "claim" under the Benefit
Plans.

(h) At the request of a Transferred Employee or a unionized Employee, the
Sellers and the Buyer shall facilitate the transfer of account balances of
that Transferred Employee or unionized Employee under an Employee Plan in
respect of that Transferred Employee or unionized Employee to the comparable
Replacement Benefit Plan, to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Upon the
completion of such transfer, the transferred account balances shall be fully
vested under the Replacement Benefit Plan.

 

Section 6.06 Confidentiality. From and after the Closing, Sellers shall, and
shall cause their Affiliates to, hold, and shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause their respective Representatives to hold, in confidence any
and all information, whether written or oral, concerning the Business, which
at the time is of a confidential nature (whether or not
specifically identified as confidential), except to the extent that Sellers
can show that such information (a) is generally available to and known by the
public through no fault of Sellers, any of their Affiliates or their
respective Representatives; or (b) is lawfully acquired by Sellers, any of
their Affiliates or their respective Representatives from and after the
Closing from sources which are not prohibited from disclosing such information
by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation. If Sellers or any of their
Affiliates or their respective Representatives are compelled to disclose any
information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of
Law, Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer in writing and shall disclose only
that portion of such information which Sellers are advised by their counsel in
writing is legally required to be disclosed, _provided that_ Sellers shall at
Buyers expense use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an appropriate
protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded such information.

 



51 Section 6.07 Non-competition; Non-solicitation

 

(a) For a period of five years commencing on the day immediately following the
Closing Date (the "Restricted Period"), Sellers shall not, and shall not
permit any of their Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i) engage in or
assist others in engaging in the Restricted Business in the Territory; (ii)
have an interest in any Person that engages directly or indirectly in the
Restricted Business in the Territory in any capacity, including as a partner,
shareholder, member, employee, principal, agent, trustee or consultant; or
(iii) cause, induce or encourage any material actual or prospective client,
customer, supplier or licensor of the Business, or any other Person who has a
material business relationship with the Business, in each case as at the
Effective Time, to terminate or modify any such actual or prospective
relationship. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Seller may own, directly or
indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of any Person traded on any
national securities exchange if such Seller is not a controlling Person of, or
a member of a group which controls, such Person and does not, directly or
indirectly, own 5% or more of any class of securities of such Person.

(b) For the Restricted Period, Sellers shall not, and shall not permit any of
their Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, hire or solicit any person who is
offered employment by Buyer pursuant to Section 6.05(a) or is or was employed
in the Business during the Restricted Period, or encourage any such employee
to leave such employment or hire any such employee who has left such
employment, except pursuant to a general solicitation which is not directed
specifically to any such employees; _provided, that_ nothing in this Section
6.07(b) shall prevent Sellers or any of their Affiliates from hiring (i) any
employee whose employment has been terminated by Buyer or (ii) after 180 days
from the date of termination of employment, any employee whose employment has
been terminated by the employee.

(c) Sellers acknowledge that a breach or threatened breach of this Section
6.07 would give rise to irreparable harm to Buyer, for which monetary damages
would not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in the event of a
breach or a threatened breach by Sellers of any such obligations, Buyer
shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may be
available to the Buyer in respect of such breach, be entitled to seek
equitable relief, including a temporary restraining order, an injunction,
specific performance and any other relief that may be available from a court
of competent jurisdiction.

(d) Sellers acknowledge that the restrictions contained in this Section 6.07
are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Buyer and
constitute a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that
any covenant contained in this Section 6.07 should ever be adjudicated to
exceed the time, geographic, product or

 



52  service or other limitations permitted by applicable Law in any
jurisdiction, then any court is expressly empowered to reform such covenant,
and such covenant shall be deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the
maximum time, geographic, product or service or other limitations permitted by
applicable Law. The covenants contained in this Section 6.07 and each
provision hereof are severable and distinct covenants and provisions. The
invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as written
shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants or
provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or
provision in any other jurisdiction.

Section 6.08 Governmental Approvals and Consents.

(a) Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give all notices to,
and obtain all consents from, all third parties that are described in Section
4.03 of the Disclosure Schedules.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the Parties undertakings pursuant to
subsection (a) above, each of the Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to:

 

(i) avoid the imposition of any order or the taking of any action that would
restrain, alter or enjoin the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document; and

(ii) in the event any Governmental Order adversely affecting the ability of
the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document has been issued, to have such Governmental
Order vacated or lifted.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.08 shall require,
or be construed to require, Buyer or any of its Affiliates to agree to (i)
sell, hold, divest, discontinue or limit, before or after the Closing Date,
any assets, businesses or interests of Buyer or any of their Affiliates; (ii)
any conditions relating to, or changes or restrictions in, the operations of
any such assets, businesses or interests which, in either case, would
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or materially
and adversely impact the economic or business benefits to Buyer of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents; or (iii) any material modification or waiver of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

 



53 Section 6.09 Books and Records.

 

(a) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by Sellers prior to the Closing, or for any other
reasonable purpose, for a period of six years after the Closing, Buyer shall:

(i) retain the Books and Records (including personnel files) relating to
periods prior to the Closing in a manner reasonably consistent with the prior
practices of Sellers; and

(ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the Sellers Representatives reasonable
access (including the right to make, at Sellers expense, photocopies), during
normal business hours, to such Books and Records.

 

(b) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made by or against or
incurred by Buyer after the Closing, or for any other reasonable purpose, for
a period of six years following the Closing, Sellers shall:

(i) retain the books and records (including personnel files) of Sellers which
relate to the Business and its operations for periods prior to the Closing;
and

(ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the Buyers Representatives reasonable
access (including the right to make, at Buyers expense, photocopies), during
normal business hours, to such books and records.

 

(c) Neither Buyer nor Sellers shall be obligated to provide the other party
with access to any books or records (including personnel files) pursuant to
this Section 6.09 where such access would violate any Law.

Section 6.10 Closing Conditions From the date hereof until the Closing, each
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as are
necessary to expeditiously satisfy the closing conditions set forth in Article
VII hereof.

 

Section 6.11 Public Announcements. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law
or stock exchange requirements (based upon the reasonable advice of counsel),
no Party shall make any public announcements in respect of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise communicate with any news
media without the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and the Parties
shall cooperate as to the timing and content of any such announcement.

 

Section 6.12 Bulk Sales Laws. The parties hereby waive compliance with the
provisions of the _Bulk Sales Act_ (Ontario) and any other bulk sales, bulk
transfer or similar Laws of any jurisdiction that may otherwise be applicable
with respect to the sale of any or all of the Purchased Assets to the Buyer,
and the Sellers shall indemnify the Buyer from any liability arising by
reason of the waiver of the _Bulk Sales Act_ (Ontario), as set out more
particularly in the Indemnification Agreement.

 



54 Section 6.13 Receivables. From and after the Closing, if Sellers or any of
their Affiliates receive or collect any funds relating to any Accounts
Receivable or any other Purchased Asset, Sellers or their Affiliate shall
remit such funds to Buyer within five Business Days after their receipt
thereof. From and after the Closing, if Buyer or its Affiliates receive or
collect any funds relating to any Excluded Asset, Buyer or its Affiliate shall
remit any such funds to Sellers within five Business Days after their receipt
thereof.

 

Section 6.14 Transfer Taxes. The Buyer shall pay directly to the Sellers, or
where permitted by applicable Law, directly to the appropriate Governmental
Authority all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value
added and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest)
payable by Buyer in connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents (including any real property transfer Tax and any other similar
Tax). Buyer shall, at its own expense, timely file any Tax Return or other
document with respect to such Taxes or fees (and Sellers shall cooperate with
respect thereto as necessary). Upon request of Sellers, Buyer shall furnish
to Sellers proof of direct payment to the applicable Governmental Authority of
the Taxes described in this Section. Buyer shall indemnify and save harmless
Sellers from any amounts, including interest and penalties, that may be
assessed against any Seller arising out of the failure of Buyer to pay, when
due, any Taxes described in this Section.

 

Section 6.15 Change of Name. Within ten (10) Business Days following the
Closing Date, Scepter shall file articles of amendment and take all other
action necessary or as may be requested by Buyer to change its name to one not
including the name "Scepter." Scepter shall provide to Buyer evidence of such
name change.

 

Section 6.16 Accounts Receivable Election. The Buyer and Scepter shall elect
jointly in the prescribed form under section 22 of the _Income Tax Act_
(Canada) and under any similar provision of any other applicable provincial
legislation as to the sale of the Accounts Receivable forming part of the
Purchased Assets and described in section 22 of the _Income Tax Act_
 (Canada), and shall in that election allocate an amount equal to the portion
of the Purchase Price allocated to those assets pursuant to the Allocation
Schedule as the consideration paid by the Buyer for those assets. The Buyer
and Scepter shall file such election forms, along with any documentation
necessary or desirable to give effect to such election, with CRA and any other
appropriate provincial taxation authority within the prescribed time limits.

 



55 Section 6.17 Section 167 Election. Scepter shall jointly elect with the
Buyer under subsection 167(1) of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) and under any
similar provision of any applicable provincial legislation imposing a similar
value added or multi-staged tax, that no tax be payable with respect to the
purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets pursuant to this Agreement. Scepter
and the Buyer shall make those elections in prescribed form containing
prescribed information and the Buyer shall file those elections in compliance
with the requirements of applicable legislation. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the Buyer shall indemnify and hold each Seller
harmless in respect of any such Taxes, penalties, interest and other amounts
which may be assessed against the Sellers as a result of the transactions
under this Agreement not being eligible for such elections or as a result of
the Buyers failure to file such elections within the prescribed time.

 

Section 6.18 Subsection 20(24) Election. Buyer and Sellers acknowledge that
Buyer has agreed to assume the Assumed Liabilities. To the extent that any
Seller has received amounts in respect of services not rendered or goods not
delivered, in each case prior to the Closing, the Purchased Assets having a
fair market value equal to those amounts are transferred to Buyer as payment
for Buyers agreement to assume a corresponding amount of the Assumed
Liabilities relating to those services or goods and, if requested by Buyer,
Buyer and Sellers shall jointly elect pursuant to subsection 20(24) of the
_Income Tax Act_ (Canada) and under any similar provision of any applicable
provincial legislation. The Parties shall file such election forms, along with
any documentation necessary or desirable to give effect to such election, with
CRA and any other appropriate taxation authority within the prescribed time
periods.

Section 6.19 Section 56.4 Election. At the request of any Party and to the
extent permitted by the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada), the requested Parties and
any other Person that is a party to any of the Non-Competition Agreements
shall make and file any election or amended election in prescribed form (or
such other form as a Party may reasonably request) and within the prescribed
time limits pursuant to subsection 56.4(7) of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada),
and any analogous provision of provincial or territorial Tax legislation.

 

Section 6.20 Supplement of Schedules. From time to time after the date of this
Agreement but in any event not later than the Closing Date, Sellers will
supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules with respect to any matter
existing before or occurring after the date of this Agreement that would have
been required to be set forth or described in the Disclosure Schedules or
which is necessary to correct any information set forth in the Disclosure
Schedules which has been rendered inaccurate thereby. If the information (the
"Supplemental Information") contained in such supplement or amended
disclosure provided by Sellers to Buyer after the date hereof was existing on
the date hereof, and failure to disclose such information resulted in a
material breach of any representation or

  



56  warranty of Seller (the "Existing Matter Supplement"), Buyer shall have the
right to either (a) immediately terminate this Agreement upon written notice
to Sellers or (b) consummate the Closing of the transactions contemplated
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Buyer elects to proceed to
Closing, the Existing Matter Supplement shall not be deemed to cure any breach
of a representation and warranty made in this Agreement by Sellers and;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Buyer shall retain all rights and remedies
provided to it under this Agreement and the Indemnification Agreement with
respect thereto, including the ability to bring a claim against Sellers
pursuant to the Indemnification Agreement. If, on the other hand, the
Supplemental Information was not existing on the date hereof (and, therefore,
did not constitute a breach of any representation or warranty of Sellers, but
arose after the date hereof), Buyer shall consummate the Closing of the
transactions contemplated hereunder and the Disclosure Schedules will be
deemed to have been amended to include such Supplemental Information, unless
such Supplemental Information is outside the ordinary course of business of
Scepter and, if existing but not disclosed as of the date hereof, would have
constituted a material breach of any representation or warranty of Sellers, in
which case Buyer may terminate this Agreement without recourse against
Sellers.

Section 6.21 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, each of the Parties
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver
such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances and take
such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions
hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents.

ARTICLE VII

 

CONDITIONS TO CLOSING

 

Section 7.01 Conditions to Obligations of All Parties. The obligations of each
Party to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
subject to the fulfillment, at or prior to the Closing, of each of the
following conditions:

(a) No Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced or entered any Governmental Order which is in effect and has the
effect of making the transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal,
otherwise restraining or prohibiting consummation of such transactions or
causing any of the transactions contemplated hereunder to be rescinded
following completion thereof.

 

(b) Sellers shall have received all consents, authorizations, orders and
approvals from the Governmental Authorities referred to in Section 4.03, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, and no such consent,
authorization, order and approval shall have been revoked.

 



57 (c) Each of Scepter and Buyer shall be satisfied, in its sole and absolute
discretion, with all material terms and conditions of insurance coverage,
including without limitation, the period of coverage, limits of coverage (on a
per occurrence basis and in the aggregate), premium(s) payable, deductible
amounts, coverage exceptions and the claims filing requirements, to be
provided under a run-off commercial general liability insurance policy to be
obtained by either of the Parties in respect of the general liability of the
Parties for any product liability claims arising or made in connection with
the conduct of the Business by Scepter prior to the Effective Time (the "Run-
Off Insurance"). In the event that the Run-Off Insurance is obtained by Buyer
or its Affiliate prior to Closing, the Parties acknowledge and confirm that
it will include each of Scepter and its Affiliates as an additional named
insured under such coverage, and the Purchase Price payable under this
Agreement and the Eco One Purchase Agreement shall be reduced in an amount
agreed by Scepter and Buyer to represent reimbursement on a dollar-for-dollar
basis for the aggregate premium(s) payable by Buyer or its Affiliate for the
duration of coverage under the Run-Off Insurance.

 

(d) The conditions to closing of the Eco One Acquisition shall have been
satisfied in accordance with the Eco One Purchase Agreement, provided, that
if the conditions have not been, or it becomes apparent that any of the
conditions will not be satisfied and such failure is due to the failure of Eco

agreement, instrument or other document as amended, supplemented and modified

64  interpretation against the party drafting an instrument or causing any
instrument to be drafted. The Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits referred to
herein shall be construed with, and as an integral part of, this Agreement to
the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim herein.

Section 10.04 Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for reference only
and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 10.05 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of
this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision
in any other jurisdiction. Except as provided in Section 6.07(d), upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as

contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest
extent possible.

agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein

the event of any inconsistency between the statements in the body of this
Agreement and those in the other Transaction Documents, the Exhibits and
Disclosure Schedules (other than an exception expressly set forth as such in

control.

Section 10.07 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Neither Party may assign its rights or obligations

assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to one or more
of its Affiliates. No assignment shall relieve the assigning Party (including
the Guarantor) of any of its obligations hereunder.

 

Section 10.08 No Third-party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns
and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon

waiving. No waiver by any party shall operate or be construed as a waiver in
respect of any failure, breach or default not expressly identified by such
written waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and whether
occurring before or after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in
exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement
shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or

AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY MAY BE INSTITUTED IN THE COURTS OF ONTARIO, AND EACH PARTY
IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY SUCH
SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICE OR OTHER
DOCUMENT BY MAIL TO SUCH PARTYS ADDRESS SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL BE EFFECTIVE
SERVICE OF PROCESS FOR ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY
SUCH COURT. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO
THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR ANY PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY
SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN
AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY

66  THEREBY. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO

accordance with the terms hereof and that the Parties shall be entitled to
seek specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other

Section 10.12 Guarantee.

 

(a) _Guarantee_. The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees (this "Guarantee") the prompt payment and performance to each of
the Sellers (and their respective successors and assigns) of all indebtedness,
liabilities and obligations of any kind whatsoever which Buyer has from time
to time incurred or is under or may hereafter incur or be under to the
Sellers under, in connection with or with respect to this Agreement
(collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations"). The Sellers shall not be
required to proceed first against the Buyer or any other Person or against any
collateral security held by it before resorting to the Guarantor for payment
pursuant to this Guarantee.

(b) _Guarantee Unconditional_. The obligations of the Guarantor under this
Guarantee are continuing, unconditional and absolute, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, will not be released, discharged, diminished,
limited or otherwise affected by (and the Guarantor hereby consents to or
waives, as applicable, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law):

(i) any extension, other indulgence, renewal, settlement, discharge,
compromise, waiver, subordination or release in respect of any of the
Guaranteed Obligations, security, Person or otherwise;

 

(ii) any modification or amendment of the Guaranteed Obligations, including
any increase or decrease in any amount thereof;

 

(iii) any change in the existence, structure, constitution, name, objects,
powers, business, control or ownership of the Buyer or any other Person, or
any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding
affecting the Buyer or any other Person or its assets;

 



67 (iv) any invalidity, illegality or unenforceability relating to or against the
Buyer or any provision of applicable Law purporting to prohibit the payment
or performance by the Buyer of the Guaranteed Obligations;

(v) any defense arising by reason of any failure of any Seller to make any
presentment, demand for performance, notice of non-performance, protest, and
any other notice (including notice of acceptance of this guarantee, partial
payment or non-payment of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations and
the existence, creation, or incurring of new or additional Guaranteed
Obligations);

(vi) any defense arising by reason of any failure of any Seller to proceed
against Buyer or any other Person, to proceed against, apply or exhaust any
security held from Buyer or any other Person for the Guaranteed Obligations,
to proceed against, apply or exhaust any security held from the Guarantor or
any other Person for this Guarantee or to pursue any other remedy in the power
of the Sellers whatsoever;

 

(vii) any Law which provides that the obligation of a guarantor must neither
be larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the
principal obligation or which reduces a guarantors obligation in proportion
to the principal obligation;

(viii) any defense arising by reason of any incapacity, lack of authority, or
other defense of Buyer or any other Person; or

(ix) any defense based upon or arising out of any bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, arrangement, readjustment of debt, liquidation or
dissolution proceeding commenced by or against Buyer or any other Person,
including any discharge of, or bar against collecting, any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, in or as a result of any such proceeding.

(c) _Recourse against Debtor_. Sellers are not required to exhaust their
recourse against Buyer or others or under any other security or guarantee
before being entitled to payment from the Guarantor under this Guarantee.

 

(d) _Settlement of Accounts_. Any account settled or stated between the
Sellers and Buyer will be accepted by the Guarantor as _prima facie_ evidence
that the amount thereby appearing due by Buyer to the Sellers is so due.

(e) _No Waiver_. No delay on the part of any Seller in exercising any of its
rights, or partial or single exercise thereof, will constitute a waiver
thereof. No waiver of any of the Sellers rights hereunder, and no
modification or amendment of this Guarantee, will be deemed to be effective
unless made in writing, duly signed by the Sellers and the Guarantor, and each
such waiver, if any, will apply only with respect to the specific instance
involved, and will in no way impair the rights of the Sellers or the
liabilities of the Guarantor to the Sellers in any other respect at any other
time.

 



68 (f) Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for payment, or the
liability of Buyer to make payment, of any amount specified to be payable by
Buyer in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed, prohibited or
otherwise affected upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or winding-
up of Buyer or any moratorium affecting the payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration or payment
will nonetheless be deemed for all purposes of this Guarantee to be and to
become due and payable by Buyer and shall be payable by the
Guarantor hereunder forthwith on demand by the Sellers.

(g) _Reinstatement_. If, at any time, all or any part of any payment
previously applied by the Sellers to any of the Guaranteed Obligations is or
must be rescinded or returned by the Sellers for any reason whatsoever
(including the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of Buyer), such
Guaranteed Obligations will, for the purpose of this Guarantee, to the extent
that such payment is or must be rescinded or returned, be deemed to have
continued in existence, notwithstanding such application by the Sellers, and
this Guarantee will continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case
may be, as to such Guaranteed Obligations, all as though such application by
the Sellers had not been made.

(h) _Taxes and Set off by Guarantor_. All payments to be made by the
Guarantor hereunder will be made without set off or counterclaim and without
withholding or deduction for any Taxes, restrictions or conditions of any
nature whatsoever.

 

(i) _Payment of Expenses; Indemnification_. The Guarantor will pay on demand,
and will indemnify and save the Sellers harmless from, any and all
liabilities, costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses on a
solicitor-client basis) incurred by the Sellers in the enforcement of this
Guarantee.

 

(j) _Expiry_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, and for greater
certainty without any effect whatsoever on the obligations of the Buyer under
this Agreement, this Guarantee shall expire upon consummation of the Closing.

Section 10.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall be
deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement
delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic transmission shall
be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy
of this Agreement.
