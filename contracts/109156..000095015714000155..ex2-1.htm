AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  


 

  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of February 19, 2014 (this
"Agreement"), is among Signet Jewelers Limited, a Bermuda corporation
("Parent"), Carat Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Zale Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"). Certain terms used in this Agreement are used as
defined in Section 8.11.

  

  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company and Merger Sub have
approved and declared advisable, and the Board of Directors of Parent has
approved, this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the
Company (the "Merger"), on the terms and subject to the conditions provided
for in this Agreement;

  

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company unanimously resolved to
recommend that its stockholders adopt this Agreement; and

  

  

WHEREAS, Parent has required, as a condition to its willingness to enter into
this Agreement, that Z Investment Holdings, LLC (the "Principal Stockholder")
enter into a Voting and Support Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the
"Support Agreement"), simultaneously herewith, pursuant to which, among other
things, the Principal Stockholder has agreed to vote to adopt this Agreement
and take certain other actions in furtherance of the Merger, in each case on
the terms and subject to the conditions provided for in the Support Agreement.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I 
 

  

  

The Merger

  

  

SECTION 1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall
merge with and into the Company, and the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

  

  

SECTION 1.2. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on a date to be specified by the
parties, which date shall be no later than the second Business Day after
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of those conditions at such time), at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and
Manges LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10153, unless another time,
date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto; provided,
however, that, if the Marketing Period has not ended at such time, the Closing
shall occur instead on (a) the date following the satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions that is the earlier to occur of (i) any Business Day during
the Marketing Period to be specified by Parent to the Company on no less than
three (3) Business Days' written notice and (ii) the first Business Day after
the last day of the Marketing Period; or (b) such other date and time as
agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that the receipt of the Financing is not a condition to
Closing and that the failure to obtain the Financing, in and of itself, shall
not in any way relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations to close the
Merger on the Closing Date. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred
to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date."

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 1.3. Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger, executed
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the "Certificate of
Merger"). The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate
of Merger or at such later time as is agreed to by the parties hereto and
specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes
effective is herein referred to as the "Effective Time").

  

  

SECTION 1.4. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

  

SECTION 1.5. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended at the Effective Time to read as the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time (except as to the name of the Surviving Corporation, which
shall be "Zale Corporation"), and as so amended shall be the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  

  

SECTION 1.6. Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors
are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II

  

  

Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the

  

Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates; Company Stock Options

  

  

SECTION 2.1. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock (as defined below) or any
shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Sub:

  

  

(a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, be converted into one (1) fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) Conversion of Company Common Stock.

  

  

(i) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01, of the Company ("Company
Common Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than (A) shares of the Company Common Stock to be cancelled or retained
by a Subsidiary of the Company in accordance with Section 2.1(c) and (B)
Dissenting Shares), shall be converted into and shall thereafter represent the
right to receive $21.00 in cash (the "Merger Consideration").

  

  

(ii) From and after the Effective Time, the Company Common Stock converted
into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article II shall no longer
remain outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate previously representing any such
Company Common Stock or shares of Company Common Stock that are in non-
certificated book-entry form (either case being referred to in this Agreement,
to the extent applicable, as a "Certificate") shall thereafter cease to have
any rights with respect to such securities, except the right to receive the
consideration to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to this Section
2.1.

  

  

(iii) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding common stock of the Company
shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
or combination, exchange, merger, consolidation or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, or any
similar transaction or event, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly
dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) At the Effective Time, (i) (A) all shares of Company Common Stock that are
owned by Parent or Merger Sub and (B) any shares of Company Common Stock that
are owned by the Company as treasury stock shall be automatically cancelled
and shall cease to exist and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor, and (ii) each share of Company Common Stock owned by a
Subsidiary of the Company shall remain outstanding with the appropriate
adjustments to the number thereof to preserve the relative percentage interest
in the Company and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

  

  

(d) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder
who did not vote in favor of the Merger and who is entitled to demand and
properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting
Stockholders"), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right
to receive the Merger Consideration (the "Dissenting Shares"), but instead
such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to
appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holder's
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such share of Company Common
Stock, in accordance with Section 2.1(b), without any interest thereon. The
Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
the Company relating to stockholders' rights of appraisal, and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to
settle, any such demand for payment. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.2 to pay for shares
of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall
be returned to Parent upon demand.

  

  

SECTION 2.2. Exchange of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Paying Agent. On or promptly following the Closing Date, Parent shall
deposit with Wells Fargo Shareowner Services or such other bank or trust
company as may be designated by Parent and that is reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the "Paying Agent"), an amount in cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II (other than
any Merger Consideration payable to Optionholders pursuant to Section 2.3(a)
and RSU Holders pursuant to Section 2.3(b)), such Merger Consideration being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund".

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Payment Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose
shares of Company Common Stock (other than shares of Company Common Stock to
be cancelled or retained by a Subsidiary of the Company in accordance with
Section 2.1(c) and Dissenting Shares) were converted pursuant to Section
2.1(b) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall
have such other provisions (including customary provisions with respect to
delivery of an "agent's message" with respect to shares held in book-entry
form) as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash equal
to the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this
Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, in each case, without interest.

  

  

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock previously represented by such Certificates, and at the close of
business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates that evidenced ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided
for herein or by applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of Section
2.2(e), if, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

(e) Termination of Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for one hundred eighty (180)
days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any holder of
a Certificate who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim
for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to such date on
which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become property
of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration shall become, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent, free and clear
of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  

(g) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and shall be
paid to, Parent. Nothing contained in this Section 2.2(g) and no investment
losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent
shall diminish the rights of any holder of Company Common Stock to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided herein.

  

  

(h) Withholding Taxes. Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law.
Parent shall provide the Company reasonable notice prior to the Effective Time
of any amounts that will be so deducted or withheld (other than backup
withholding) from any consideration payable to holders of Company Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.1. To the extent amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such amounts (a) shall be remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority in

appropriate, any committee of the Board of Directors of the Company
administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take
such other actions as may be required to effect the following:

  

  

(i) at the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock granted under the Zale Corporation 2003 Stock Incentive Plan, the Zale
Corporation 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Company 2011 Stock Plan"), the

Stock Option") shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time and each holder
thereof (each, an "Optionholder") shall cease to have any rights with respect

converted into a right of the applicable Optionholder to receive an amount in
cash equal to the excess (if any) of (I) the Merger Consideration multiplied
by the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time over (II) the aggregate
exercise price payable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time (it being understood that, for the avoidance of
doubt, if the aggregate exercise price payable upon exercise of a Company
Stock Option equals or exceeds the product of the Merger Consideration
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such
Company Stock Option, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled for no
consideration); and

  

  

(ii) as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent

of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Surviving

Vested Restricted Stock Unit") shall become fully vested and be cancelled as
of the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of such Time-Vested
Restricted Stock Unit (a "TRSU Holder") and each TRSU Holder shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration with respect to each share of Company Common Stock subject to
such Time-Vested Restricted Stock Units immediately prior to the Effective
Time;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10

Restricted Stock Unit") shall be converted into a restricted stock unit award,
on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Rollover
Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect to
a number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Rollover Restricted Stock
Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up
or down to the nearest whole share (a "Converted Restricted Stock Unit") (it
being understood that for purposes of this clause (ii), "Exchange Ratio" shall
mean a fraction, the numerator of which is the Merger Consideration and the
denominator of which is the volume weighted average price per share of Parent
Common Stock on The New York Stock Exchange for the fifteen (15) consecutive
trading days ending on (and including) the trading day immediately prior to
the Effective Time (as reported by The Wall Street Journal for each such
trading day, or, if not reported by The Wall Street Journal, any other
authoritative source mutually selected by Parent and the Company)).

  

  

(iii) at the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit granted under the
Company Stock Plans subject to performance-based vesting conditions that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time other than a
Rollover Restricted Stock Unit (each, a "Performance-Vested Restricted Stock
Unit", and together with the Time-Vested Restricted Stock Units and Rollover
Restricted Stock Units, the "Restricted Stock Units") shall become vested at
the Applicable PRSU Percentage and cancelled as of the Effective Time by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or any holder of such Performance-Vested Restricted Stock Unit (a
"PRSU Holder", and together with the TRSU Holders, the "RSU Holders") and each
PRSU Holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to the Applicable PRSU
Percentage of the target number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Performance-Vested Restricted Stock Units immediately prior to the
Effective Time (it being understood that for purposes of this clause (iii),
"Applicable PRSU Percentage" shall mean (A) 100% if more than 50% of the
relevant performance period under the Performance-Vested Restricted Stock Unit
is completed as of the Closing Date and (B) 50% if 50% or less of the relevant
performance period under the Performance-Vested Restricted Stock Unit is
completed as of the Closing Date); and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iv) as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent

pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(i) and (iii), by means of wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee of the Board of Directors of the Company
administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take
such other actions as may be required to effect the following:

  

  

(i) at the Effective Time, each long-term incentive program cash award granted
under the Company 2011 Stock Plan (each such award, a "LTI Cash Award") shall
become satisfied at the Applicable LTI Percentage and cancelled as of the
Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of such LTI Cash Award (a "LTI
Holder") and each LTI Holder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Applicable
LTI Percentage of the "Maximum Total Incentive Compensation Opportunity" (as
defined in the applicable LTI Cash Award) (it being understood that for
purposes of this sentence, "Applicable LTI Percentage" shall mean (A) 100% if
more than 50% of the relevant performance period under the LTI Cash Award is
completed as of the Closing Date and (B) 50% if 50% or less of the relevant
performance period under the LTI Cash Award is completed as of the Closing
Date) (the "LTI Cash Award Cancellation Payment"); and

  

  

(ii) as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent
shall pay or deliver to the Surviving Corporation (or the Surviving
Corporation's applicable payroll providers) for payment to the LTI Holders the

administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take
such other actions as may be required to effect the following: at the
Effective Time, each Restricted Share granted under the Company Stock Plans
that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become
fully vested and be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1.

  

  

(e) Prior to the Closing, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee of the Board of Directors of the Company
administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take
such other actions as may be required to effect the following: at the
Effective Time, each stock unit granted under the Company Stock Plans that is
not subject to vesting conditions that is outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time (each, a "Deferred Stock Unit") shall be converted into
the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of such Deferred Stock
Units, an amount equal to the Merger Consideration with respect to each share
of Company Common Stock subject to such Deferred Stock Units immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise
or settlement of the Converted Restricted Stock Units in accordance with this
Section 2.3. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC a Form S-8 (or file such other appropriate form)
registering a number of shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to fulfill
Parent's obligations under this Section 2.3.

  

  

SECTION 2.4. Restructure. If, prior to the Closing Date, Parent and the
Company determine, acting reasonably and in good faith and in consultation
with their respective tax advisors, that, as a result of a change in
applicable Law occurring after the date of this Agreement, facts relating to
the Merger or other similar circumstances, Parent or the Company (or any of
their respective Subsidiaries) is more likely than not to recognize a material
amount of taxable income or gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes or may
be subject to a material amount of tax elsewhere (including Canada or Puerto
Rico), in connection with the Merger, subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall give good faith consideration
to proposals to seek to restructure the Merger and related transactions in a
manner that reduces or eliminates such taxable income or gain or tax;
provided, however, that any such proposals shall not result in or require a
delay in the Closing and no party shall be required to take any action (other
than give good faith consideration to such proposals) as a result of this
provision.

  

  

ARTICLE III 
 

  

  

Representations and Warranties of the Company

  

  

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that the
statements contained in this Article III are true and correct except as set
forth in (i) the body of (i.e., not including the exhibits) the Company SEC
Documents filed with, or furnished to, the SEC and publicly available after
July 31, 2012 and prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Filed Company SEC
Documents") (excluding any disclosures in the Filed Company SEC Documents that
are set forth under the headings "Risk Factors" or disclosure of risks set
forth in any "forward−looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements
that are similarly cautionary, nonspecific or predictive in nature; it being
understood that any factual information contained within such headings,
disclosure or statements shall not be excluded) or (ii) the disclosure
schedule delivered by the Company to Parent simultaneously with the execution
and delivery by the Company of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure
Schedule") (it being understood that any information set forth in one section
or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to
and qualify the section or subsection of this Agreement to which it
corresponds and each other section or subsection of this Agreement to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face that such information is
relevant to such other section or subsection):

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 3.1. Organization, Standing and Corporate Power.

  

  

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing (where such concept is recognized under
applicable Law) under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated
and has all requisite corporate power and authority necessary to own or lease
all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except, in the case of the Company's Subsidiaries, where the
failure to be duly organized, validly existing or in good standing or to have
such power and authority would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly
licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has
not had, or would not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all Subsidiaries
of the Company together with the jurisdiction of organization of each such
Subsidiary. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or
indirectly by the Company free and clear of all liens, pledges, charges,
mortgages, encumbrances, adverse rights or claims and security interests of
any kind or nature whatsoever (including any restriction on the right to vote
or transfer the same, except for such transfer restrictions of general
applicability as may be provided under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act"),
and the "blue sky" laws of the various States of the United States)
(collectively, "Liens"), other than Permitted Liens. Except as set forth in
Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not own,
directly or indirectly, any capital stock, voting securities or equity
interests in any Person.

  

  

(c) The Company has delivered to Parent correct and complete copies of its
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (the "Company Charter Documents") and
correct and complete copies of the certificates of incorporation and bylaws
(or comparable organizational documents, including the limited partnership
agreement of Zale Canada Holding LP) of each of its Subsidiaries (the
"Subsidiary Documents"), in each case as amended to the date of this
Agreement. All such Company Charter Documents and Subsidiary Documents are in
full force and effect and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
in violation of any of their respective provisions. The Company has made
available to Parent and its representatives correct and complete copies of the
minutes of all meetings of stockholders, the Board of Directors and each
committee of the Board of Directors of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries held since July 31, 2012, in each case other than the meetings at

Plans or otherwise, (iii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by
the Company in its treasury, (iv) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
reserved for issuance under the Company Stock Plans (including identifying (A)
the number of such shares of Company Common Stock subject to outstanding
Company Stock Options granted under the Company Stock Plans or otherwise, (B)
and the number of such shares of Company Common Stock subject to outstanding
Restricted Stock Units granted under the Company Stock Plans or otherwise
which, with respect to any Performance Vested Restricted Stock Units, shall be
based on the achievement of maximum-level performance) and (C) the number of
Deferred Stock Units granted under the Company Stock Plans or otherwise, (v)
the number of shares of Company Preferred Stock issued or outstanding, and
(vi) the number of shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance upon

Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.

  

  

(b) Included in Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule is a correct
and complete list, as of January 31, 2014, of all outstanding options or other
rights to purchase or receive shares of Company Common Stock granted under the
Company Stock Plans or otherwise (including Restricted Shares, Restricted
Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units), and, for each such option or other
right, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto, the terms
of vesting, the grant and expiration dates and exercise price thereof, if

the date hereof, the Company has not issued any shares of its capital stock,
voting securities or equity interests, or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of its capital stock, voting
securities or equity interests, other than pursuant to the outstanding
options, Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units and Warrants referred
to above in Section 3.2(a). Except (A) as set forth above in Section 3.2(a) or
(B) as otherwise expressly permitted by Section 5.2 hereof and the Company
Disclosure Schedule related thereto, as of the date of this Agreement there
are not, and as of the Effective Time there will not be, any shares of capital
stock, voting securities or equity interests of the Company issued and
outstanding or any subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, convertible or
exchangeable securities, rights, commitments or agreements of any character
providing for the issuance of any shares of capital stock, voting securities
or equity interests of the Company, including any representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any Company Common Stock. All Company Stock
Options have an exercise price equal to no less than the fair market value of
the underlying shares of Company Common Stock on the date of grant, determined
in accordance with Section 409A of the Code.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has issued or is bound by
any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, convertible or
exchangeable securities, rights, commitments or agreements of any character
providing for the issuance or disposition of any shares of capital stock,
voting securities or equity interests of any Subsidiary of the Company. There
are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock, voting
securities or equity interests (or any options, warrants or other rights to
acquire any shares of capital stock, voting securities or equity interests) of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No Subsidiary of the Company owns any
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock.

  

  

SECTION 3.3. Authority; Noncontravention; Voting Requirements.

  

  

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and, subject to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement, and the consummation by it of the Transactions, have been duly
authorized and approved by its Board of Directors, and except for obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval for the adoption of this Agreement and filing
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, no other corporate action on the part of the Company is necessary to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation by it of the Transactions. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the other parties hereto,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general
application affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity, whether
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity (the "Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception").

  

  

(b) The Company's Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has
unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Merger, and (ii) resolved to, subject to Section
5.3, recommend that stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor
the consummation by the Company of the Transactions, nor compliance by the
Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) conflict with or
violate any provision of the Company Charter Documents or any of the
Subsidiary Documents or (ii) assuming that the authorizations, consents and
approvals referred to in Section 3.4 and the Company Stockholder Approval are
obtained and the filings referred to in Section 3.4 are made, (x) violate any
Law, judgment, writ or injunction of any Governmental Authority applicable to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties
or assets, or (y) violate, conflict with, result in the loss of any benefit
under, constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time,
or both, would constitute a default) under, result in the termination of or a
right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance
required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective
properties or assets of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of any loan or credit agreement,
debenture, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease,
contract or other agreement, instrument or obligation (each, a "Contract") or
Permit, to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by
which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound
except, in the case of clause (ii), for such violations, conflicts, losses,
defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations or Liens as, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(d) The affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at the Company Stockholders
Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement (the "Company Stockholder Approval") is the only vote or
approval of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries which is necessary to adopt this Agreement and
approve the Transactions.

  

  

SECTION 3.4. Governmental Approvals. Except for (i) the filing with the SEC of
a proxy statement relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting (as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the "Proxy Statement"), and other filings
required under, and compliance with other applicable requirements of, the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules of the New York
Stock Exchange, (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware pursuant to the DGCL and the
filing of any required documents with relevant authorities of other
jurisdictions in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is qualified to
do business, (iii) filings required under, and compliance with other
applicable requirements of, the HSR Act, and (iv) the filings with insurance
regulatory authorities set forth on Section 3.4 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no consents or approvals of, or filings, notices to or declarations
or registrations with, any Governmental Authority are necessary for the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the performance by
the Company of its obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company
of the Merger, other than such other consents, approvals, filings,
declarations or registrations that, if not obtained, made or given, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to impair in any
material respect the ability of the Company to perform its obligations
hereunder, or prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay
the consummation of the Transactions.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 3.5. Company SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities.

  

  

(a) The Company has filed and furnished all required reports, schedules,
forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and other
statements with the SEC since July 31, 2012 (collectively and together with
all documents filed or furnished on a voluntary basis on Form 8-K and all
documents filed or furnished after the date hereof, and in each case including
all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference
therein, the "Company SEC Documents"). None of the Company's Subsidiaries is
required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act.
As of their respective effective dates (in the case of Company SEC Documents
that are registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the
Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing dates (in the case of
all other Company SEC Documents), the Company SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, applicable to such Company
SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents as of such respective
dates, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date
of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments received
from the SEC staff with respect to the Company SEC Documents. To the Knowledge
of the Company, none of the Company SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing
SEC review or investigation. The Company is in compliance in all material
respects with all listing and governance requirements of the New York Stock
Exchange.

  

  

(b) The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents complied as to form, as of their respective dates of
filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of
unaudited quarterly statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC or other
rules and regulations of the SEC), applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except (i) as may be indicated in the notes thereto or (ii)
as permitted by Regulation S-X) and fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).

  

  

(c) The Company has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in
Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to
the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is accumulated and communicated to the Company's principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Since August 1, 2012, neither the Company nor the
Company's independent registered accounting firm has identified to the Company
or to the audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (i) any
"significant deficiencies" in the design or operation of internal controls
which could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Company's ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial data, (ii) any "material
weaknesses" in internal controls, or (iii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves the Company's management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Company's internal controls. The principal executive
officer and the principal financial officer of the Company have made all
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any
related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the
Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are
complete and correct. The management of the Company has completed its
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended July 31, 2013, and such assessment
concluded that such controls were effective. As of the date hereof, to the
Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or circumstances that would
prevent its chief executive officer and chief financial officer from giving
the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise)
that would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a consolidated
balance sheet of the Company prepared in accordance with GAAP (as in effect on
the date hereof) or the notes thereto, except (i) liabilities as and to the
extent reflected or reserved against on the audited balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of July 31, 2013 (the "Balance Sheet Date")
(including the notes thereto) included in the Company's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2013, (ii) liabilities incurred after
the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, (iii) liabilities incurred as contemplated by this Agreement or

or has ever been treated as a single employer, with any of them under Section
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code ("ERISA Affiliate") has currently or in

(c) The Company Plans have been operated and maintained, in all material
respects, in accordance with their terms and with all applicable provisions of
ERISA, the Code (including documentary and operational compliance with Section

aggregate, result in a material liability to Parent: (i) neither the Company

Company Plans has engaged in a non-exempt "prohibited transaction" within the
meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA; and (ii) no

Company Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401 or other tax-
favored treatment under of Subchapter B of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code
and any trusts intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under the
Code. Nothing has occurred with respect to the operation of the Company Plans
that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification or
exemption, or the imposition of any material liability, penalty or tax under
ERISA or the Code.

  

  

(e) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a
material liability to Parent, all contributions (including all employer

to the Company Plans (other than routine benefit claims), nor does the Company
have any Knowledge of facts that could form the basis for any such claim or
lawsuit.

insurance, benefits, or coverage for any participant or any beneficiary of a
participant, except as set forth in Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or as may be required under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended and at the sole expense of the

Person, (ii) increase any benefits under any Company Plan, (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits under any

4999 of the Code.

  

  

(j) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a material liability to Parent, any individual who

situated outside the United States (the "Foreign Plans"): (i) all employer and
employee contributions to each Foreign Plan required by law or by the terms of
such Foreign Plan have been made, or, if applicable, accrued in accordance

of any employees, nor has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries entered into
any collective bargaining agreement or union contract recognizing any labor

SECTION 3.15. Intellectual Property.

  

  

(a) Section 3.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an accurate
and complete list of all Intellectual Property Rights that the Company has
registered with a Governmental Authority, or with respect to which the Company
has filed an application for such a registration (collectively, "Registered
IP"). Section 3.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists the
jurisdictions in which each such item of Registered IP has been issued or
registered or in which any application for such issuance and registration has
been filed. All necessary registration, maintenance, renewal, and other
relevant filing fees due through the date hereof in connection with all
Registered IP comprised of Marks and all other material Registered IP have
been timely paid and all necessary documents and certificates in connection
therewith have been timely filed with the relevant Governmental Authorities in
the United States or foreign jurisdictions, as the case may be, for the
purposes of maintaining the Registered IP in full force and effect, other than
where the failure to have timely paid or timely filed such fees in respect of
such Registered IP would not reasonably be expected to be material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  

  

(b) The Company and/or one (1) of its Subsidiaries is the sole and exclusive
owner of all right, title and interest in and to, or has valid and continuing
rights to use, sell and license, all Company Intellectual Property comprised
of Marks, and all other material Company Intellectual Property. All Company
Intellectual Property comprised of Marks and all other material Company
Intellectual Property owned or purportedly owned by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, including all applicable Registered IP, is (i) subsisting and,
to the Knowledge of the Company, valid and enforceable, and (ii) is free and
clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens. The use, practice or other
commercial exploitation of the Company Intellectual Property comprised of
Marks and all other material Company Intellectual Property, in each case owned
or purportedly owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries, and the operation of
the Company's and its Subsidiaries' businesses do not infringe, constitute an
unauthorized use of or misappropriate any Intellectual Property Rights of any
third Person. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
the subject of any pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
suit, action, investigation or proceeding which involves a claim against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of infringement, unauthorized use, or
violation of any Intellectual Property Rights of any Person, or challenging
the ownership, use, validity, enforceability, disposal or exploitation of any
Company Intellectual Property, or any products, processes or materials covered
thereby in any manner. The Company has not, since August 1, 2012 and prior to
the date hereof, received written notice of any such threatened claim nor are
there any facts or circumstances that would form the basis for any such claim.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Since August 1, 2012, to the Knowledge of the Company, no Person
(including employees and former employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) is infringing, violating, misappropriating or otherwise misusing
any Company Intellectual Property, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has made any such claims against any Person (including employees
and former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) nor, to the
Knowledge of the Company, is there any basis for such a claim.

  

  

(d) To the Knowledge of the Company, no material Trade Secret has been
authorized to be disclosed or has been actually disclosed by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to any employee or any third Person other than
pursuant to a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement restricting the
disclosure and use of the Company Intellectual Property. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable steps necessary to protect and
preserve the confidentiality of all material Trade Secrets of the Company or
its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material
respects with all Company promulgated privacy policies and all laws, rules and
regulations relating to privacy, data protection, anti-spam, personally
identifiable information, and similar consumer protection laws ("Information
Privacy Laws"), including with respect to the Collection and Use of Personally
Identifiable Information. The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken
commercially reasonable measures to protect and maintain the privacy of such
Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with the Information Privacy
Laws and the Company's and its Subsidiaries' policies and procedures, in all
material respects. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has,
since August 1, 2012, through the date hereof, received notice of any claims
that it has violated any Information Privacy Laws or been charged with the
violation of any Information Privacy Laws, and neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is under investigation with respect to any violation of any
Information Privacy Laws and there are no facts or circumstances that could
form the basis for any such violation.

  

  

(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries have valid and enforceable ownership,
lease, or license rights in, or otherwise have valid and enforceable rights to
use, all Software, hardware, databases, computer equipment and other
information technology necessary for the operations of the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' businesses (collectively, "Computer Systems"). To the Knowledge
of the Company, the Computer Systems used by the Company and its Subsidiaries
have functioned consistently and accurately in all material respects since
being installed. Since August 1, 2012 through the date hereof, the Computer
Systems have not failed to any material extent and the data that they process
has not been corrupted.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken all reasonable steps in
accordance with industry standards to preserve the availability, security and
integrity of the Computer Systems and the data and information stored on the
Computer Systems owned or exclusively controlled by the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including establishment of and compliance with a written
information security program that: (i) includes administrative, technical and
physical safeguards designed to safeguard the security, confidentiality and
integrity of Personally Identifiable Information stored on the Computer
Systems owned or exclusively controlled by the Company and its Subsidiaries;
and (ii) is designed to protect against unauthorized access to Personally
Identifiable Information stored on the Computer Systems owned or exclusively
controlled by the Company and its Subsidiaries. To the Company's Knowledge,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has suffered a material
security breach with respect to any Personally Identifiable Information stored
on the Computer Systems owned or exclusively controlled by the Company and its
Subsidiaries during the three-year period ending on the date hereof. To the
Knowledge of the Company, no material breach or violation of any security
program described above has occurred or, to is threatened, and there has been
no unauthorized or illegal use of or access to any Personally Identifiable
Information. As of the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has notified, or since August 1, 2012, has been required to
notify, any Person of any material information security breach involving
Personally Identifiable Information.

the foregoing shall not apply with respect to filings, amendments or
supplements by the Company in compliance with Section 5.3 relating to a

SECTION 5.3. No Solicitation.

  

  

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the Company's and
its Subsidiaries' respective directors, officers, employees, investment
bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, agents and other
representatives (collectively, "Representatives") to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to a Takeover Proposal, and use reasonable
best efforts to obtain the return from all such Persons or cause the
destruction of all copies of confidential information previously provided to
such parties by the Company, its Subsidiaries or Representatives. The Company
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly cause, facilitate or
encourage (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or
proposals that constitute any Takeover Proposal or (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any third party regarding any Takeover
Proposal; provided, however, that if at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company receives a written Takeover Proposal
in circumstances not involving a breach of this Section 5.3, (i) the Company
and its Representatives may contact the Person making such Takeover Proposal
solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof, and (ii) if the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after receiving advice from
its outside counsel and its financial advisors, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,
then the Company and its Representatives may, at any time prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval (but in no event after obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval) and after providing Parent not less than 24 hours
written notice of its intention to take such actions (A) furnish information
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Takeover Proposal, but only after such Person enters into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; provided the Company advises Parent of its delivery
of non-public information to such Person concurrently with its delivery to
such Person and promptly following its delivery to such Person the Company
delivers to Parent all such information not previously provided to Parent, and
(B) participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person regarding
such Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that
any violation of the foregoing restrictions by the Company's Subsidiaries or
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.3 by the
Company. The Company shall provide Parent with a correct and complete copy of
any confidentiality agreement entered into pursuant to this paragraph within
24 hours of the execution thereof.

  

  

 

(b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
Section 5.3, the Company shall promptly advise Parent, orally and in writing,
and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt, if any Takeover Proposal is
received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and shall, in any such
written notice to Parent,

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

indicate the identity of the Person making such Takeover Proposal and the
terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal (and include a copy of any
written Takeover Proposal where applicable), and thereafter shall promptly
keep Parent reasonably informed of all material developments affecting the
status and terms of any such Takeover Proposal (and the Company shall provide
Parent with copies of any additional material written materials received that
relate to such Takeover Proposal).

  

  

(c) Except as expressly permitted by Section 5.3(d), neither the Board of
Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw or
modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Board Recommendation or the approval or declaration of
advisability by such Board of Directors of this Agreement and the Transactions
(including the Merger), (B) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal or (C) fail to reject any Takeover
Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer within ten (10) Business
Days of the commencement thereof (including by taking no position with respect
to the acceptance by the Company's stockholders of a tender offer or exchange
offer) (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a
"Company Adverse Recommendation Change", it being understood that a customary
"stop, look and listen" communication by the Board of Directors of the Company
or any committee thereof pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act shall not, in and of itself, constitute a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change) or (ii) approve, cause or authorize the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, memorandum of understanding, merger, acquisition, purchase or joint
venture agreement or other agreement related to any Takeover Proposal (other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with
Section 5.3(a)).

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval (but in no event after obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval) the Board of Directors of the Company and any committee thereof may
(i) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change only in response to (A) the
Company receiving a written Takeover Proposal that constitutes a Superior
Proposal in circumstances not involving a breach of this Section 5.3 or (B) an
Intervening Event or (ii) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement and,
concurrently with or immediately after such termination, cause the Company to
enter into a definitive written agreement providing for such Superior
Proposal, which proposal did not result from any breach of this Section 5.3,
if and only if, in all cases (x) such Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consulting with and receiving advice from outside counsel and
financial advisors, that the failure to make such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or effect such termination would constitute a breach by
the Board of Directors of the Company of its fiduciary duties to the Company's
stockholders under Delaware Law and (y) the provisions of Section 5.3(e) are
complied with.

  

  

(e) (1) No Company Adverse Recommendation Change may be made in response to a
Superior Proposal or Intervening Event and (2) no termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 5.3(d) may be made (x) until the fourth
Business Day specified below following Parent's receipt of written notice from
the Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends
to, in the case of

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

clause (1), make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change (a "Company
Adverse Recommendation Notice"), or in the case of clause (2), terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 5.3(d) (a "Notice of Superior Proposal"),
which notice shall specify (I) in the case of such an action taken in
connection with a Superior Proposal, the terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal (including the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal
and a copy of the then-current forms of all of the relevant proposed
transaction documents related thereto, including definitive agreements with
respect to such Superior Proposal and the documents with respect to any
financing of such Superior Proposal provided to the Company in respect
thereof), or (II) if the basis of the proposed action by the Board of
Directors of the Company is an Intervening Event, a description of the
Intervening Event, and (y) unless the Company shall have (A) during the four
(4) Business Day period specified above (and any additional period related to
a revision to the Superior Proposal, as provided below), negotiated, and
caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate, with Parent in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to proposed
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal (or, in the case of
a Company Adverse Recommendation Notice that is not related to a Superior
Proposal, so that the failure to make such Company Adverse Recommendation
Change is no longer a breach by the Board of Directors of the Company of its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders under Delaware Law); and (B) prior to or
concurrently with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.3(d),
paid the Company Termination Fee required under Section 7.3(a)(iii).

  

  

The parties agree that, in the case of such actions taken in connection with a
Superior Proposal, any material amendment to the financial terms or other
material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Company Adverse
Recommendation Notice or Notice of Superior Proposal and an additional two (2)
Business Day period (the period inclusive of all such days, the "Notice
Period"). The Company agrees that (i) during the Notice Period the Company
shall, and shall cause its financial advisors and outside legal counsel to,
negotiate with Parent in good faith if Parent indicates to the Company that it
desires to negotiate the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) the Company shall
take into account all changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent in determining whether such Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal. The Company shall promptly keep Parent informed of all
material developments affecting the terms of any such Superior Proposal (and
the Company shall provide Parent with copies of any additional material
written materials received that relate to such Superior Proposal).

  

  

(f) Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of the
Company or any committee thereof from (i) taking and disclosing to the
Company's stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii)
making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel)
that failure to do so would be a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders under applicable Law; provided that this Section 5.3(f) shall not
in any way eliminate or modify the effect that any such action would otherwise
have under this Agreement, including that the taking of such action may

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

constitute a breach of another provision of this Section 5.3 (unless at the
time of the taking of any such action under this Section 5.3(f), the Board of
Directors of the Company publicly reaffirms its Company Board Recommendation
to its stockholders in favor of the Merger).

  

  

SECTION 5.4. Reasonable Best Efforts.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including Section
5.4(d)), each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and
use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective
reasonable best efforts to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things, necessary, proper or
advisable to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as
reasonably practicable and to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner reasonably practicable, the Transactions, including
preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all
necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions
of information, applications and other documents (including any required or
recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), and (ii) obtain all
approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations from any Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate the Transactions. For purposes hereof, "Antitrust
Laws" means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR
Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other applicable
Laws issued by a Governmental Authority that are designed or intended to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition through
merger or acquisition.

  

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
reasonably practicable and in any event, unless otherwise agreed by the
parties, within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof and to supply as
promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions consistent with
this Section 5.4 necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable and (ii)
the Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (x) take
all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law
is or becomes applicable to any of the Transactions and (y) if any state
takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable to any of the Transactions,
take all action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the Transactions.

  

  

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party, and (ii) keep the other

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

parties informed in all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of
any material communication received by such party from, or given by such party
to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice or any other Governmental Authority and of any material communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
each case regarding any of the Transactions. Subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, each of the parties hereto shall have
the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will
consult the other parties on, all the information relating to the other
parties and their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in
any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party
and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions. Each of
Merger Sub, Parent and the Company agree not to participate in substantive
meetings or discussions, either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Authority in connection with the proposed transactions unless, to
the extent reasonably practicable, it consults with the other parties in
advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Authority,
gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate.

  

  

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.4, each of the parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted
by a Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to the Transactions;
in this context "reasonable best efforts" shall include, (i) defending any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, that
challenge this Agreement, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
hereby; (ii) avoiding the entry of and seeking to have lifted, vacated or
reversed any stay, injunction, temporary restraining order or other restraint
entered by any court or other Governmental Authority; (iii) divesting,
disposing of, leasing, licensing or transferring any assets or entities; (iv)
entering into hold-separate agreements (each of the actions described in
clauses (iii) and (iv), a "Remedial Action"); and (v) proposing or agreeing to
do or permitting to be done any of the foregoing, in each case as may be
required in order to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as
promptly as reasonably practicable; provided, however, that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall
not be required to sell, divest, dispose, license, lease, operate, conduct in
a specified manner, hold separate or discontinue or restrict or limit, before
or after the Closing Date, any assets, liabilities, businesses, product lines,
licenses, operations, or interest in any assets or businesses, that would,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a Burdensome Condition on the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the
business of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall not,
without Parent's prior written consent, commit to any divestiture transaction
or agree to any restriction on the Company's business at the request of a
Governmental Authority in connection with its review of the Transaction under
an applicable Antitrust Law (such consent to be granted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence).

  

  

One or more Remedial Actions shall constitute a "Burdensome Condition" if and
to the extent such Remedial Actions, individually or in the aggregate with all
other Remedial Actions taken together, would result in (i) the loss of
revenues of the Company in

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

excess of $135.0 million, as measured by the Company's fiscal year 2013
revenue and as reported in the Company's audited financial statements for such
year, or (ii) the loss of sales of Parent in excess of $135.0 million, as
measured by Parent's fiscal year 2013 sales and as reported in Parent's
audited financial statements for such year, or (iii) the combination of losses
of revenues contemplated in clause (i) and sales contemplated in clause (ii)
in excess of $135.0 million in the aggregate.

  

  

SECTION 5.5. Financing.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide, shall cause the
Subsidiaries of the Company and its and their respective officers and
employees to provide, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and
their respective Representatives to provide, on a timely basis, all
cooperation that is reasonably requested by Parent and customary in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing, including using its reasonable best
efforts to (i) facilitate the execution and delivery of definitive financing,
pledge, security and guarantee documents (which documents shall only be
required to become effective with regard to the Company and its Subsidiaries
as of the Closing Date) and the provision of guarantees and security and the
performance of the other obligations thereunder; (ii) promptly provide all
financial and other information regarding the Company and the Subsidiaries of
the Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent in order to consummate
the Financing, including such information that would be required in a
registration statement on Form S-3 for an offering registered under the
Securities Act (which shall include all financial statements of the Company
and its Subsidiaries that would be required under Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X,
and all financial data of the Company and its Subsidiaries that would be
required in order to prepare pro forma financial statements under Article 11
of Regulation S-X, assuming the Merger had been completed and without giving
effect to any grace periods permitted for providing such information); (iii)
provide customary certificates, opinions and other documents and instruments,
and take all necessary corporate action, relating to the Financing; (iv)
obtain customary authorization letters, accountants' comfort letters
(including negative assurance), and accountants' consent letters, as may be
reasonably requested by Parent; (v) cooperate with Parent to obtain surveys
and title insurance as may be reasonably requested by Parent; (vi) cause its
senior officers to be available, upon reasonable advance notice, to
participate in a reasonable number of informational meetings, due diligence
sessions, sessions and presentations with lenders and rating agencies and road
show meetings in connection with the Financing; (vii) cooperate with Parent
and Parent's efforts to obtain customary corporate, facilities and securities
ratings; (viii) provide customary authorization letters to the lenders and
agents in respect of the Financing authorizing the distribution of information
to prospective lenders and containing a representation to such financing
sources that the public side versions of such documents, if any, do not
include material non-public information about the Company or its Affiliates or
its or their securities; (ix) reasonably assist Parent and its financing
sources in the preparation of all offering documents, an offering memorandum
or prospectus and other marketing and rating agency materials for the
Financing and reasonably cooperate with any due diligence investigation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the Financing; and (x)
furnish, for no fee, to the Financing Sources (upon the request of the
Financing Sources) an electronic version of

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

the Company's trademarks, service marks and corporate logo for use in
marketing materials for the purpose of facilitating the Financing (the
"License"); provided, however, that the License shall be used solely for the
purpose described above and may not be assigned or transferred by such
Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to (A) pay
any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability or obligation
of any kind, including under any guarantee or pledge or any other document
relating to the Financing, in connection with the Financing prior to the
Closing Date or (B) enter into any binding agreement or commitment, or adopt
any resolution or otherwise take any corporate or similar action, in
connection with the Financing that is not conditioned on the occurrence of the
Closing Date. The cooperation requested of the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not unreasonably interfere with ongoing operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or otherwise materially impair the ability of any officer or
executive of the Company to carry out its duties to the Company. Parent shall
promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 5.5 and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company and their respective
directors and other Representatives from and against any and all losses,
damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with the Financing and any information used in connection therewith
(except with respect to information provided by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), and any action taken by any of them at the request of Parent or
Merger Sub pursuant to this Section 5.5(a), except, in each case, to the
extent such losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses arose from the gross
negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  

  

(b) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding any party
obtained by the other parties hereto pursuant to this Section 5.5 shall be
kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement; provided,
however, that upon prior notice to the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall be
permitted to disclose such information to potential sources of capital, rating
agencies, prospective lenders and investors and their respective
Representatives in connection with the Financing so long as such Persons agree
to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement or other customary
confidentiality undertakings reasonably satisfactory to the Company and of
which the Company shall be a beneficiary.

  

  

(c) With respect to any outstanding indebtedness of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries of the Company set forth on Section 5.5(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedules, (i) the Company shall, or shall have caused its
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to deliver all notices and take
other actions required to facilitate the termination of commitments in respect
of such indebtedness, repayment in full of all obligations in respect of such
indebtedness and release of any Liens and guarantees in connection therewith
on the Closing Date and (ii) no later than one (1) Business Day prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall, or shall have caused its Subsidiaries to, use
reasonable best efforts to furnish to Parent customary payoff letters with
respect to such indebtedness (each, a "Payoff Letter") in substantially final
form and in form and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent from all financial institutions
and other Persons to which such indebtedness is owed, or the applicable agent,
trustee or other representative on behalf of such Persons, which Payoff
Letters shall (x) indicate the total amount required to be paid to fully
satisfy all principal, interest, prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage
costs or other outstanding and unpaid obligations related to such indebtedness
as of the Closing Date (the "Payoff Amount") and (y) state that all
obligations (including guarantees) in respect thereof and Liens in connection
therewith on the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise
on the business of the Company shall be, substantially concurrently with the
receipt of the Payoff Amount on the Closing Date by the Persons holding such
indebtedness, released or arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Parent for
such release shall have been made by such time, subject, as applicable, to the
replacement (or cash collateralization or backstopping) of any then
outstanding letters of credit or similar indebtedness.

  

  

SECTION 5.6. Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither the
Company nor Parent or Merger Sub shall issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement (to the extent not previously
issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Merger,
this Agreement or the other Transactions without the prior consent of the
other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
except as may be required by Law or by any applicable listing agreement with a
national securities exchange or The New York Stock Exchange as determined in
the good faith judgment of the party proposing to make such release (in which
case such party shall not issue or cause the publication of such press release
or other public announcement without prior consultation with the other
parties); provided, however, that the Company need not consult Parent in
connection with the matters referred to in Section 5.3, including any press
release or public statement to be issued or made in order to effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with Section 5.3, and Parent
need not consult the Company in, or in connection with, responding to any
Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

  

  

SECTION 5.7. Access to Information; Confidentiality. The Company and its
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, financial advisors and
other Representatives, shall afford to Parent and its Representatives and
Financing Sources, upon reasonable notice, reasonable access during normal
business hours during the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time
and the termination of this Agreement to all of the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' properties, books and records and to those employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to whom such persons reasonably
request access, and, during such period, the Company shall furnish, as
promptly as reasonably practicable to such persons all information concerning
the Company's and its Subsidiaries' business, properties and personnel as such
persons may reasonably request. Parent, its Representatives and Financing
Sources shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. The Company and Parent shall provide each other with such
cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may request of the
other in filing any Tax Returns and in determining the optimal structure

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

for the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries after the Merger.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to provide access to or disclose information if the Company
reasonably determines that such access or disclosure would (i) jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
protections of the work-product doctrine, (ii) contravene any Law or violate a
Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or (iii)
expose the Company to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or
personal information; provided that, in any such case, the Company or its
Subsidiary, as applicable, shall provide such information in redacted form as
necessary to preserve such privilege or comply with such Law or otherwise make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements, to the extent possible. Except
for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the confidentiality letter
agreement dated as of December 20, 2013, between Parent and the Company (as
such agreement may be amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), each of the Company and Parent shall hold, and shall cause their
respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and
other Representatives to hold, all information received from the other party
or its Representatives, directly or indirectly, in confidence in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement. No information or knowledge obtained by
any Person in any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall affect or
be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by any party hereto.

  

  

SECTION 5.8. Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of
such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, and (ii) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such party's Knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Transactions.

  

  

SECTION 5.9. Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify the individuals who
at or prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company or
of a Subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the "Indemnitees") with respect
to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior
to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent (A) required by the Company
Charter Documents, the Subsidiary Documents, and each other Contract with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries providing for indemnification of such
Indemnitee, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, (B)
permitted under applicable Law.

  

  

(b) The Company may (or at the request of Parent, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to) obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time, prepaid (or
"tail") directors' and officers' liability insurance policies with respect to
acts or omissions

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

occurring prior to the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and
directors in their capacity as such for six (6) years from the Effective Time,
covering each such person on terms with respect to coverage and amounts and
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than the
policies currently in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, however,
that, without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company may not expend
per year of coverage more than 250% of the amount currently expended by the
Company per year of coverage as of the date of this Agreement (the "Maximum
DandO Amount") to maintain or procure such "tail" insurance policies. In the
event the Company does not obtain such "tail" insurance policies, then, Parent
shall cause the individuals serving as officers and directors of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time who are then covered by the directors'
and officers' liability insurance policy currently maintained by the Company
(a correct and complete copy of which has heretofore been delivered to Parent)
to be covered for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time by such
policy (provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and directors
in their capacity as such; provided, that in no event shall Parent be required
to expend per year of coverage more than the Maximum DandO Amount. If
notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts to do so, Parent or the
Company, as applicable, is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called
for by this paragraph, Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall obtain as
much comparable insurance as available for the Maximum DandO Amount. The
Indemnitees may be required to make reasonable application and provide
reasonable and customary representations and warranties to applicable
insurance carriers for the purpose of obtaining such insurance.

  

  

(c) The Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.9 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.9. The provisions of this Section 5.9 are
intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her heirs and are
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have under the
Company Charter Documents or under those Contracts disclosed on Section 5.9 of
the Company Disclosure Schedules. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 5.9 shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this
Section 5.9 applies unless (i) such termination or modification is required by
applicable Law or (ii) the affected Indemnitee has consented in writing to
such termination or modification.

  

  

(d) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain, no later than
April 30, 2014, supplemental insurance policies to its existing employment
practices liability insurance policies, in form and substance (including as to
coverage amounts and coverage periods) reasonably acceptable to Parent (the
"Tail Policies"), in order to insure against events occurring on or prior to
the Closing; provided, that in no event shall the Company be required to
expend per year of coverage more than $1,000,000 (the "Maximum EPL Amount") to
maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto. If, notwithstanding
the use of reasonable best efforts to do so, the Company is unable to

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this paragraph, the Company
shall obtain as much comparable insurance as available for the Maximum EPL
Amount.

  

  

 

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this Section 5.9.

 

  

  

SECTION 5.10. Securityholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any securityholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parent's prior
consent (such consent not to be unreasonable withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

  

  

SECTION 5.11. Fees and Expenses. Except as provided in Section 7.3, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Support
Agreement, the Merger and the Transactions shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

  

  

SECTION 5.12. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and
Parent shall take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party
hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

  

SECTION 5.13. Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) For a period of six months after the Effective Time (the "Continuation
Period"), Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided to each employee of
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries who is an employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the "Continuing Employees"), while employed, (i) a rate of base
salary or wages, and target cash bonus opportunity (but excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, equity and equity based compensation) that is no less
favorable than the rate of base salary or wages, and target cash bonus
opportunity provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided under the
Company Plans to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit or restrict the
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation) from modifying or amending a Continuing Employee's compensation
or benefit entitlements in connection with adjustments in the position,
duties, and/or responsibilities of such Continuing Employee in the ordinary
course of business.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA) maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing
Date and in which any of the Continuing Employees participate (the "Parent
Plans"), for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, level of
benefits, and vesting (but not for accrual of benefits other than determining
the level of vacation, paid-time-off and severance), each Continuing
Employee's service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as
service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary,
to the extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized by the
Company or such Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries if and to the extent such service was recognized under the
comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided,
however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

  

  

(c) Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, in the year in which the
Closing Date occurs, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions,
actively at work requirements and waiting periods under any employee welfare
benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates in which Continuing
Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from
and after the Effective Time if and to the extent such conditions and
exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such Continuing Employee under
the comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent
shall recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-
payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Continuing
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant employee welfare
benefit plans in which they will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time, to the extent credited under the employee welfare benefit
plans that are Company Plans maintained by the Company prior to the Effective
Time.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.13, with
respect to any Continuing Employees based outside of the United States,
Parent's obligations under this Section 5.13 shall be modified to the extent
necessary to comply with applicable Laws of the foreign countries and
political subdivisions thereof in which such Continuing Employees are
situated.

  

  

(e) This Section 5.13 shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section
5.13, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person
(including for the avoidance of doubt any current or former directors,
officers, employees, contractors or consultants of any of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section
5.13, including any right in respect of continued employment with the Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation)
for any period of time. Nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to
any Company Plan or plan, program, policy, agreement, arrangement or
understanding of Parent.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 5.14. Termination of Certain Agreements. If requested by Parent no
later than five (5) Business Days prior to Closing, the Company shall,
conditioned on and effective as of the occurrence of the Closing Date,
terminate the interest rate swap and hedging arrangements set forth on Section
5.14 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

SECTION 5.15. Required Actions The Company shall, promptly upon receipt
thereof, deliver to Parent the document set forth on Section 5.15 of the

Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 6.1,

ARTICLE VII

  

  

Termination

  

  

SECTION 7.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time:

  

  

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent duly authorized by
each of their respective Boards of Directors; or

  

  

(b) by either of the Company or Parent:

  

  

(i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before February 19,
2015 (as such date may be extended pursuant to Section 8.8, the "End Date"),
provided, that, in the event that the Marketing Period has commenced, but
Closing has not yet occurred, then the End Date shall automatically be
extended to the date that is five (5) Business Days following the then
scheduled end date for the Marketing Period; provided further, however, that
(x) if, on the End Date, any of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section
6.1(b) or 6.1(c) relating to a Restraint in respect of an Antitrust Law shall
not have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waived
by both the Company and Parent, but all other conditions to the Closing (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing)
have been satisfied, then the End Date shall, without any action on the part
of the parties hereto, be extended to the fifteen-month anniversary of the
date hereof, or such earlier date as may be agreed in writing by Parent and
the Company and (y) the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
7.1(b)(i) shall not be available to a party whose failure to perform any of
its obligations under this Agreement has been a principal cause of the failure
of the Merger to be consummated on or before the End Date (it being understood
that Parent and Merger Sub shall be deemed a single party for purposes of the
foregoing proviso);

  

  

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 6.1(c) shall be
in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(ii) shall
not be available to a party whose failure to perform any of its obligations
under this Agreement has been a principal cause of the entry of, or the
failure to remove, such Restraint;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Company Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof; or

  

  

(c) by Parent:

  

  

(i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of the Company set
forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (A)
would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or (b) and (B) is
incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by the Company within sixty (60)
calendar days following receipt of written notice from Parent of such breach
or failure; provided that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(i) if Parent or Merger Sub is then
in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements hereunder;

  

  

(ii) if (A) the Company shall have (1) materially breached its obligations
under Section 5.1 by failing to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting or (2)
materially breached the Company's agreement not to solicit in Section 5.3(a)
or (B) prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change shall have occurred; or

  

  

(d) by the Company,

  

  

(i) if either Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of Parent or
Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or
failure (A) would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date)
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or (b) and
(B) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by Parent or Merger Sub
within sixty (60) calendar days following receipt of written notice from the
Company of such breach or failure; provided that the Company shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(d)(i) if
the Company is then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder; or

  

  

(ii) in accordance with Section 5.3(d).

  

  

SECTION 7.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, written notice thereof shall be given to
the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which
such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and
void (other than the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

provisions of the first sentence of Section 3.19, the penultimate sentence of
Section 5.7, Sections 5.11, 7.2 and 7.3, and Article VIII, all of which shall
survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective directors,
officers and Affiliates, except (i) as liability may exist pursuant to the
Sections specified in the immediately preceding parenthetical that survive
such termination, and (ii) nothing shall relieve any party from liability for
fraud or any willful breach of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 7.3. Termination Fees.

  

  

(a) In the event that:

  

  

(i) (A) a bona fide Takeover Proposal shall have been made directly to the
Company's stockholders generally or any Person shall have publicly announced
(and not withdrawn) (whether or not conditional) a Takeover Proposal after the
date hereof and prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, and thereafter, (B)
(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section
7.1(b)(i) (other than as a result of the failure of the conditions to Closing
set forth in Section 6.1(b) or 6.1(c) as it relates to a Restraint in respect
of an Antitrust Law) or 7.1(b)(iii) or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by
Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i), and (C) the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, a Takeover Proposal
within twelve (12) months of the date this Agreement is terminated; or

  

  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii); or

  

  

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(ii);

  

  

then in any such event under clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of this Section
7.3(a), the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of $26.7 million in
cash (the "Company Termination Fee") less the amount of Expenses previously
paid by the Company to Parent pursuant to the next paragraph.

  

  

In the event that a bona fide Takeover Proposal shall have been made directly
to the Company's stockholders generally or any Person shall have publicly
announced (and not withdrawn) (whether or not conditional) a Takeover Proposal
after the date hereof and prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, and
thereafter this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to
Section 7.1(b)(iii), then the Company shall pay to Parent all of the Expenses
of Parent and Merger Sub in an amount not exceeding $12,500,000 and thereafter
the Company shall be obligated to pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee
(less the amount of Expenses previously actually paid to Parent pursuant to
this sentence) in the event such fee is payable pursuant to Section 7.3. As
used herein, "Expenses" means all out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including
all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, financial advisors and
investment bankers to a party hereto and its Affiliates), incurred by a party
or on its behalf in connection with or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

  

related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement, the filing of any required notices under
applicable Antitrust Laws or other regulations in connection with the
Transactions and all other matters related to the Merger and the other
Transactions. For purposes of this Section 7.3(a), the term "Takeover
Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term, except that the
references to "20% or more" shall be deemed to be references to "50% or more".

  

  

(b) Any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (i) of Section 7.3(a)
shall be made to Parent promptly following the earlier of the execution of a
definitive agreement with respect to, or the consummation of, any transaction
contemplated by a Takeover Proposal (and in any event not later than two (2)
Business Days after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment
following such event); any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (ii)
of Section 7.3(a) shall be made to Parent promptly following termination of
this Agreement by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) (and in any event not
later than two (2) Business Days after delivery to the Company of notice of
demand for payment following such termination); and, in circumstances in which
Expenses are payable, such payment shall be made to Parent not later than two
(2) Business Days after delivery to the Company of an itemization setting
forth in reasonable detail all Expenses of Parent and Merger Sub (which
itemization may be supplemented and updated from time to time by such party
until the 60th day after such party delivers such notice of demand for
payment). All such payments shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account to be designated by Parent.

  

  

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be payable under more
than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the
occurrence of different events. In the event the Company Termination Fee is
payable under the circumstances set forth in Section 7.3(a), the right of
payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of
their respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents or
affiliates for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated.

  

  

(d) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the
Company (A) pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) and, at the time of such
termination, any of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 6.1(b)
or 6.1(c) (if such Restraint is in respect of an Antitrust Law) shall not have
been satisfied or (B) pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii) (as a result of a
Restraint under Antitrust Laws), (ii) the failure of one or more of the
conditions in Section 6.1(b) or 6.1(c) (as a result of a Restraint under
Antitrust Laws) is not caused by the failure of the Company to perform in all
material respects its obligations under Section 5.4 and (iii) the conditions
set forth in (A) Section 6.1(a) shall have been satisfied, (B) Section 6.2(a)
shall have been satisfied as if the Closing would have occurred on the date of
such termination, and (C) Section 6.2(b) shall have been satisfied (other than
with respect to the obligations that by their nature are

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

  

to be satisfied at the Closing, and were capable of being satisfied or would
have been satisfied if the Closing would have occurred on the date of such
termination), then Parent shall pay to the Company a termination fee of $53.4
million in cash (the "Parent Termination Fee").

  

  

(e) Any payment required to be made pursuant to Section 7.3(d) shall be made
to the Company promptly following termination of this Agreement (and in any
event not later than two (2) Business Days after delivery to Parent of notice
of demand for payment following such termination). Such payment shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account to be designated
by the Company. In the event the Parent Termination Fee is payable under the
circumstances set forth in Section 7.3(d), the right of such payment shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries against
Parent and any of its former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents or
affiliates for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated.

  

  

(f) In the event that the Company or Parent shall fail to pay the Company
Termination Fee and/or Expenses or Parent Termination Fee required pursuant to
this Section 7.3 when due, as applicable, such fee and/or Expenses, as the
case may be, shall accrue interest for the period commencing on the date such
fee and/or Expenses, as the case may be, becomes past due, at a rate equal to
the rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank, in the City of New York
from time to time during such period, as such bank's Prime Lending Rate plus
four percent (4%). In addition, (i) if the Company shall fail to pay the
Company Termination Fee and/or Expenses, as the case may be, when due, the
Company shall also pay to Parent all of Parent's costs and expenses (including
attorneys' fees) in connection with efforts to collect such fee and/or
Expenses, as the case may be, and (ii) if Parent shall fail to pay the Parent
Termination Fee when due, Parent shall also pay to the Company all of the
Company's costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with
efforts to collect such fee. Parent and the Company each acknowledges that the
fees, Expenses and the other provisions of this Section 7.3 are an integral
part of the Transactions and that, without these agreements, neither Parent
nor the Company would enter into this Agreement.

  

  

ARTICLE VIII 
 

  

  

Miscellaneous

  

  

SECTION 8.1. No Survival, Etc. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
the representations, warranties and agreements of each party hereto shall
remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation
made by or on behalf of any other party hereto, any Person controlling any
such party or any of their officers, directors or representatives, whether
prior to or after the execution of this Agreement, and no information provided
or made available shall be deemed to be disclosed in this Agreement or in the
Company Disclosure Schedule, except to the extent actually set forth herein or
therein. The representations, warranties and agreements in this Agreement
shall terminate at the Effective Time or, except as otherwise provided in
Section 7.2, upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1,
as the case

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

may be, except that the agreements set forth in Article II and Sections 5.9
and 5.11 and any other agreement in this Agreement which contemplates
performance after the Effective Time shall survive the Effective Time
indefinitely. The Confidentiality Agreement shall (i) survive termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (ii) terminate as of the
Effective Time.

  

  

SECTION 8.2. Amendment or Supplement. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether
before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, by written
agreement of the parties hereto, by action taken by their respective Boards of
Directors; provided, however, that following approval of the Transactions by
the stockholders of the Company, there shall be no amendment or change to the
provisions hereof which by Law would require further approval by the
stockholders of the Company without such approval. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Sections 8.3, 8.6, 8.7 and this Section 8.2 may not be
modified, waived or terminated in a manner that is adverse in any material
respect to the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of each
Financing Source.

  

  

SECTION 8.3. Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law and the last sentence
of Section 8.2, (a) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of any other party hereto, (b) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or acts of any other party hereto or (c) waive
compliance by any other party with any of the agreements contained herein or,
except as otherwise provided herein, waive any of such party's conditions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof
nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement
on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

  

  

SECTION 8.4. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that either Parent and Merger Sub may
assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but
no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its
obligations hereunder; provided, that if such assignment would result in
amounts being deducted or withheld for Taxes pursuant to Section 2.2(h) in
excess of the amounts that would have been so deducted or withheld in the
absence of such assignment, then the Merger Consideration shall be increased
as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made
(including any deduction or withholding applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 8.4), the applicable Person receives an amount equal to the
sum it would have received had no such assignment been made. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section 8.4 shall
be null and void.

  

  

SECTION 8.5. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one (1) or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement electronically (including
portable document format (.pdf)) or by facsimile shall be as effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 8.6. Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement,
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the Support
Agreement, and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement,
and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and except for (i) if the Effective Time occurs, the right
of the holders of Company Common Stock, holders of Options and holders of
Restricted Stock Units to receive the Merger Consideration and (ii) the
provisions set forth in Section 5.9 of this Agreement are not intended to and
shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Financing Source shall
be an express third party beneficiary of and shall be entitled to rely upon
and enforce Sections 8.2, 8.3 and 8.7 hereof, and this Section 8.6, and each
Financing Party may enforce such provisions. In addition, the Company agrees,
on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, stockholders and Representatives
(collectively, the "Company Affiliated Parties"), that the Financing Sources
and their Affiliates, stockholders and Representatives and each of their
successors and assigns (collectively, the "Financing Parties") shall be
subject to no liability or claims (whether legal or equitable, arising under
contract, tort or otherwise) by the Company Affiliated Parties arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, the Financing, the transactions contemplated
hereby or in connection with the Financing, or the performance of services by
such Financing Parties with respect to the foregoing.

  

  

SECTION 8.7. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

  

  

(a) This Agreement, the Support Agreement, and any other document or
instrument delivered pursuant hereto, and all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution, termination, performance or
nonperformance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement), shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware,
without regard to its conflicts of law principles.

  

  

 

(b) All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement
shall be heard and determined exclusively in the Chancery Court of the State
of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or, if

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware or,
in the event each federal court within the State of Delaware declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state court within the State
of Delaware). In addition, each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit
itself, and hereby submits itself, to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of
such courts in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, and agrees not to plead or claim any
objection to the laying of venue in any such court or that any judicial
proceeding in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, (iii)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware or, in the event each
federal court within the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, any state court within the State of Delaware) and
(iv) consents to service of process being made through the notice procedures
set forth in Section 8.9. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable law.

  

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Action, whether in law
or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving any
Financing Sources under the Financing or any Affiliate thereof arising,
directly or indirectly, out of or relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Financing, any replacement or alternative Financing or the
performance of services thereunder, the parties hereto agree that (i) such
actions shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal
courts located in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York or any New York state court sitting in the city and county of New
York and (ii) they shall not bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring
or support anyone else in bringing any such Action in any other court.

  

  

(d) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all rights to
trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the Transactions, including in connection with the Financing or
any replacement or alternative Financing.

  

  

SECTION 8.8. Specific Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the courts described in Section 8.7(b),
without proof of damages, or bond or other security being required, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. The parties hereto agree that the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither
the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. The parties
hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, and not
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. If, prior to the
End Date, any party hereto brings any Action, in accordance with Section 8.7,
to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by
any other party, the End Date shall automatically be extended (x) for the
period during which such Action is pending, plus 10 Business Days or (y) by
such other time period established by the court presiding over such Action, as
the case may be.

  

  

SECTION 8.9. Notices. All notices, requests and other communications to any
party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered
personally, facsimiled (which is confirmed) or sent by overnight courier
(providing proof of delivery) to the parties at the following addresses:

SECTION 8.10. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other
terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain
in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  

  

SECTION 8.11. Definitions.

  

  

(a) As used in this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings ascribed
thereto below:

  

  

"Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means a customary confidentiality
agreement with the Company which is no less favorable to the Company (i.e., no
less restrictive with respect to the conduct of the Company) than the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that such Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement need not contain any standstill provision which has a term that
would extend past the term of the standstill provision in the Confidentiality
Agreement; provided that an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement may not
include any provision calling for an exclusive right to

negotiate with the Company and may not restrict the Company from complying
with Section 5.3 of this Agreement.

  

  

"Action" means any pending or threatened material legal, administrative,
arbitral or other proceeding, claim, suit or action against, or governmental
or regulatory investigation or inquiry of, a party, or any injunction, order,
judgment, ruling or decree imposed upon a party.

  

  

"Affiliate" means, as to any Person, any other Person that, directly or
indirectly, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with,
such Person. For this purpose, "control" (including, with its correlative

direction of management or policies of a Person, whether through the ownership
of securities or partnership or other ownership interests, by contract or
otherwise.

occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, has had a material adverse
effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided, however, that any
change, effect, event or occurrence will be deemed not to constitute, and will
not be taken into account in determining whether there has been or would
reasonably be expected to be, a Company Material Adverse Effect to the extent
resulting from (a) changes, effects, events or occurrences generally affecting
the economy, financial or securities markets or political, legislative or
regulatory conditions or changes in the industries in which the Company
operates; (b) the negotiation, announcement or pendency of this Agreement or
the Transactions, including the impact thereof on relationships, contractual
or otherwise, with customers, suppliers, distributers, partners, employees or
Governmental Authorities; (c) any change in the market price or trading volume
of the shares of Company Common Stock (it being understood that the facts and
circumstances giving rise to such change may be deemed to constitute, and may
be taken into account in determining whether there has been or would
reasonably be expected to be, a Company Material Adverse Effect if such facts
and circumstances are not otherwise described in clauses (a), (b) or (d)
through (g) of this definition); (d) acts of war or terrorism (or the
escalation of the foregoing) or natural

regulations applicable to the Company or applicable accounting regulations or
principles or the interpretation thereof; (f) any failure by the Company to
meet any internal or analyst projections or forecasts or estimates of
revenues, earnings or other financial metrics for any period (it being
understood that the facts and circumstances giving rise to such failure may be
deemed to constitute, and may be taken into account in determining whether
there has been or would reasonably be expected to be, a Company Material
Adverse Effect if such facts and circumstances are not otherwise described in
clauses (a) through (e) and (g) of this definition); or (g) any action taken
by the Company or its Subsidiaries that is required by this Agreement or taken
at Parent's written request, or the failure to take any action by the Company
or its Subsidiaries if that action is prohibited by this Agreement; provided,
however, that changes, effects, events or occurrences referred to in clauses
(a), (d) and (e) above shall be considered for purposes of determining whether
there has been or would reasonably be expected to be a Company Material
Adverse Effect if and to the extent such changes, effects, events or
occurrences have had or would reasonably be expected to have a materially
disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, as
compared to (i) with respect to clause (a), other companies with similar
capital structures operating in the industries in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries operate and (ii) with respect to clauses (d) and (e), other
companies operating in the industries in which the Company and its
