extent such waiver is permitted by Law) of the conditions to the Closing set
forth in _Article VII_  (except for those conditions to the Closing that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing but subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of such conditions), unless another time, date or place is mutually
agreed to in writing by the Parties. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_."

 

SECTION 1.04 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects
specified herein and in the applicable provisions of the IBCL. Without
limiting the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving

2 SECTION 1.05 _Surviving Corporation Organizational Documents_. As of the
Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended and restated to be the same as the articles of incorporation

ARTICLE II

MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES AND BOOK-ENTRY SHARES

SECTION 2.01 _Merger Consi_ _deration_.

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof:

 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Sections 2.03_ and
_2.04_ , and except as otherwise provided by paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of
this _Section_ __ _ 2.01_, each share of common stock, no par value, of the
Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, other than the Treasury Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.01(c)_, shall automatically be converted
into, and shall thereafter represent solely, the right to receive cash in
the amount of $72.00, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

(b) _Equitable Adjustment_. If at any time during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company (or any other securities convertible
therefor or exchangeable thereto) shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split

 



3  (including a reverse stock split), combination, subdivision, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a
record date during such period, or any similar event, in each case, other
than pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Merger
Consideration and any other similarly dependent items shall be equitably
adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action; provided,
however, that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.01(b)_ shall be deemed to
permit or authorize the Company to effect any such change that is
not otherwise specifically authorized or permitted by this Agreement.

(c) _Treasury Shares_. All Treasury Shares shall be canceled
automatically and retired at the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be
issued in exchange therefor.

 

(d) _Outstanding Parent Common Stock._ Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding
and unaffected by the Merger.

 

(e) _Outstanding Common Stock of Merger Sub._ Each share of common stock
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation
and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

SECTION 2.02 _Rights as Shareholders; Share Transfers_.

 

At the Effective Time, holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall cease
to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of the Company, other than
(a) to receive any dividend or other distribution with respect to such shares
of Company Common Stock with a record date occurring prior to the Effective
Time and (b) to receive the consideration provided under this _Article II_.

SECTION 2.03 _Exchange and Payment Procedures_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_.

 

(i) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company
to act as paying and exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
" _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging shares of Company Common
Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.01(a)_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to
be deposited with the Exchange Agent, an aggregate amount of cash sufficient
to deliver the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration. All such cash
shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

(ii) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate
to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent and the Depository Trust
Company (" _DTC_ ") with the objective that (x) if the Effective Time occurs
at or prior to 11:30 a.m. (New York City time) on the Closing Date, out of

 



4  available funds in the Exchange Fund, the Exchange Agent will transmit to
DTC or its nominee on the Closing Date the Merger Consideration in respect of
each share of Company Common Stock held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time (such aggregate cash amount, the "
_DTC Cash Payment_ ") and (y) if the Effective Time occurs after 11:30 a.m.
(New York City time) on the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent will transmit to
DTC or its nominee on the first Business Day after the Closing Date the DTC
Cash Payment.

 

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (but no later than three (3) Business
Days after the Effective Time), the Exchange Agent will mail to each holder
of record of a certificate representing outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Certificate_ ") and to
each holder of uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by
book entry immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "),
in each case, whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_:

(1) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and that risk of loss and title to Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
held by such holder will pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the procedures
set forth in the letter of transmittal and which shall be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company, and

 

(2) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration with respect to
such shares.

(ii) Upon surrender to, and acceptance in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.03(b)(iii)_ by, the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share
together with the letter of transmittal, if applicable, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder
thereof will be entitled to the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered under this Agreement.

(iii) The Exchange Agent will accept Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange of the Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with customary exchange practices.

 

(iv) From and after the Effective Time, no further transfers may be made on
the records of the Company or its transfer agent of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, and if any Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the

 



5  Company for transfer, such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be canceled
against delivery of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

(v) If any Merger Consideration is to be remitted to a name other than
that in which a Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, no Merger
Consideration may be paid in exchange for such surrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share unless:

 

(1) either (A) the Certificate so surrendered is properly endorsed, with
signature guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for transfer or (B) the
Book-Entry Share is properly transferred; and

 

(2) the Person requesting such payment shall (A) pay any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share or (B) establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not
payable.

 

(vi) At any time after the Effective Time until surrendered as contemplated
by this  _Section_ __ _ 2.03_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
deemed to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit
of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_.

(i) At the Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate, and each holder
of Book-Entry Shares, will cease to have any rights with respect to such
shares of Company Common Stock, except, to the extent provided by _Section_ __
_ 2.02_, for the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_; 

(ii) The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender or exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
2.03_ will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent will deliver to the
Surviving Corporation, upon the Surviving Corporations demand, any portion
of the Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income received by the
Exchange Agent

 



6  in respect of all such funds) which remains undistributed to the former
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon expiration of the period
ending one (1) year after the Effective Time. Thereafter, any former holder
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares prior to the Merger who has not complied
with this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ prior to such time, may look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of his, her or its claim for Merger
Consideration to which such holder may be entitled.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company, the Exchange Agent or
the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any former holder of shares of
Company Common Stock for any payment of the Merger Consideration delivered to
a public official if required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by
holders of shares of Company Common Stock as of a date that is immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Entity will, to the extent not prohibited by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Withholding Taxes_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Certificates, Book-Entry Shares, Company Stock Units, Company Other
Performance Units or Company Unpaid Performance Units such amounts for Taxes
as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of

case of one or more Persons, waive one or more of the rights provided to it
in this _Article II_ to withhold certain payments, deliveries and
distributions; and no such waiver shall constitute a waiver of its rights

required to cause such payment, acceleration or provision to be triggered. No
Person is entitled to receive any additional payment (including any tax

Parent, Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., dated
as of the date hereof (in each case, as redacted to remove only fee amounts,
pricing caps, rates and amounts included in the "market flex," certain other
economic provisions and certain other confidential terms (none of which could
affect the conditionality, principal amount, enforceability, termination or
availability of the Financing)), in each case, including all exhibits,
schedules, annexes and amendments to such letters in effect as of the date of
this Agreement (collectively, the " _Debt Letters_ "), pursuant to which and
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, each of the parties thereto
(other than Parent) has severally committed to lend the amounts set forth
therein to Parent (the provision of such funds as set forth therein, the "
_Financing_ ") for the purposes set forth in such Debt Letters. The Debt
Letters have not been amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived prior
to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (other than as permitted
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.04(d)_, including amendments to add lenders,
arrangers, agents, bookrunners, managers and other financing sources), and
the respective commitments contained in the Debt Letters have not been

and delivery of this Agreement, the Debt Letters are in full force and effect
and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and,
to the Parents knowledge, the other parties thereto, subject in each case to
the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions. There are no conditions precedent or
contingencies directly or indirectly related to the funding of the Financing
pursuant to the Debt Letters, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Letters. Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the terms of the
Debt Letters, Parent and Merger Sub will have at the Closing the funds
required to pay all of Parents obligations under this Agreement, including
the payment of the Merger Consideration and all fees and expenses expected to
be incurred in connection therewith. As of the date of this Agreement, no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent or, to Parents
Knowledge, any other party to the Debt Letters under the Debt Letters that
would (a) result in any of the conditions in the Debt Letters not being
satisfied or (b) otherwise result in the Financing not being available, other
than such default or breach that has been waived by the Lenders or otherwise
cured in a timely manner by Parent or Merger Sub to the satisfaction of the
Lenders, as the case may be. As of the date of this Agreement, there are
no side letters or other agreements, Contracts, arrangements or
understandings (written or oral) directly or indirectly related to the funding
of the Financing that could affect the conditionality, principal amount or
availability of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Letters. Parent will pay on the Business Day immediately following the
execution of this Agreement all commitment fees or other fees required by the
terms of the Debt Letters to be paid in connection with the execution of this
Agreement in connection with the Financing. Assuming the accuracy of the
Companys representations and warranties contained herein, as of the date of
this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to
the Financing contemplated by the Debt Letters will not be satisfied on a
timely basis or that the Financing contemplated by the Debt Letters will not
be made available on the Closing Date.

39 SECTION 5.03 _No Solicitation by the Company; Company
Board Recommendation_.

(a) The Company shall not, shall cause its Affiliates not to, and shall
use reasonable efforts to cause its and their respective officers, directors,
principals, partners, managers, members, attorneys, accountants, agents,
employees, consultants, financial advisors or other authorized representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, (i) directly or indirectly
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate any Company
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected
to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal, in each case, except for this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii) directly or
indirectly participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person
(except for Parent and Parents Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives) regarding, or furnish to any such Person, any nonpublic
information with respect to, or cooperate in any way with any such Person with
respect to, any Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal. The
Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Person (except for Parent and
Parents Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives) with respect
to any Company Takeover Proposal, request the prompt return or destruction of
all confidential information previously furnished and immediately terminate
all physical and electronic data room access previously granted to any such
Person or its Representatives. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, in
response to the receipt of a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal made
after the date of this Agreement that does not result from a breach (other
than an immaterial breach) of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_ by the Company
and that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel and a financial advisor) constitutes or could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Company Proposal, the Company and its
Representatives may (1) furnish information with respect to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal
(and its Representatives) ( _provided_ ,  _that_ (i) all such information has
previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or
concurrently with the provision of such information to such Person) pursuant
to a customary confidentiality agreement that does not restrict the Companys
ability to comply with its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_ and
(2) participate in discussions regarding the terms of such Company Takeover
Proposal, including terms of a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect
thereto, and the negotiation of such terms with the Person making such Company
Takeover Proposal (and such Persons Representatives). Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_ by any Representative of the Company or any of
its Affiliates, in each case, at the Companys direction, shall constitute a
breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_ by the Company. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, to the extent the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is required
in order for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations, the
Company may grant a waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to the extent necessary to allow a confidential Company
Takeover Proposal to be made to the Company or the Company Board so long as
the Company Board promptly (and in any event, within one Business Day)
notifies Parent thereof after granting any such waiver, amendment or release.

 



40 (b) Except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_, _Section_ __ _
5.03(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.03(e)_, and except for the public disclosure of
a Company Recommendation Change Notice, neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, change, qualify, withhold, modify
in any manner adverse to Parent, or propose publicly to withdraw, change,
qualify, withhold, modify in any manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board
Recommendation, (ii) adopt, approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
adopt, approve or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal, (iii) fail to
include in the Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation or (iv) take
any formal action or make any recommendation or public statement in
connection with a tender offer or exchange offer (except for a recommendation
against such offer or a customary "stop, look and listen" communication of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) (any action in the
foregoing clauses (i)(iv) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "). Except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_,
_Section_ __ _ 5.03(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.03(e)_, neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall authorize, permit, approve or recommend,
or propose publicly to authorize, permit, approve or recommend, or allow the
Company or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, agreement or
commitment constituting, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Company Takeover Proposal, or requiring, or that would reasonably be expected
to cause, the Company to abandon or terminate this Agreement (a " _Company
Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change if (i) a Company Intervening Event has
occurred or (ii) the Company has received a Superior Company Proposal that
does not result from a breach (other than an immaterial breach) of _Section_
__ _ 5.03_ by the Company and, in each case, if the Company Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor) that the failure to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
as a result of the occurrence of such Company Intervening Event or in response
to the receipt of such Superior Company Proposal, as the case may be, would
reasonably likely be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may not
make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless (1) the Company Board
has provided prior written notice to Parent (a " _Company Recommendation
Change Notice_ ") that it is prepared to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change at least four (4) Business Days prior to taking such
action, which notice shall specify the basis for such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, attaching the
most current draft of any Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Company Proposal or, if no draft exists, a summary of the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Company Proposal (it being understood
that such Company Recommendation Change Notice shall not in itself be deemed a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change and that if Parent has committed in
writing to any changes to the terms of this Agreement and there has been any
subsequent material

 



41  revision or amendment to the terms of a Superior Company Proposal, a new
notice to which the provisions of clauses (2), (3) and (4) of this _Section_
__ _ 5.03(c)_ shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ except that, in the case of
such a new notice, all references to four (4) Business Days in this _Section_
__ _ 5.03(c)_ shall be deemed to be two (2) Business Days), (2) during the
four (4) Business Day period after delivery of the Company Recommendation
Change Notice, the Company and its Representatives negotiate in good faith
with Parent and its Representatives regarding any revisions to this Agreement
that Parent proposes to make and (3) at the end of such four (4) Business Day
period and taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement
committed to in writing by Parent, the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor) that
the failure to make such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and that, in the
case of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Company
Takeover Proposal, such Company Takeover Proposal still constitutes a Superior
Company Proposal.

 

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in any event no later than the later of
(i) twenty-four (24) hours or (ii) 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the next
Business Day) advise Parent orally and in writing of any Company Takeover
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Company Takeover
Proposal and the identity of the Person making any such Company Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed in all material
respects on a reasonably current basis (and in any event no later than the
later of (i) twenty-four (24) hours or (ii) 5:00 p.m. New York City time on
the next Business Day) of the material terms and status (including any change
to the terms thereof) of any Company Takeover Proposal.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_ shall prohibit the
Company from (i) complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the shareholders of the
Company if, in the good-faith judgment of the Company Board (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Company Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (whether or
not in writing), with respect to any (A) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, other business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company, (B) sale, lease,
contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way
of merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination,
partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests
in a Company Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business or assets of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the
consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (C) issuance, sale or other
disposition, directly or indirectly, to any Person (or the shareholders of
any Person) or group of securities (or options, rights or warrants to
purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities)
representing 20% 

 



42  or more of the voting power of the Company, (D) transaction (including any
tender offer or exchange offer) in which any Person (or the shareholders of
any Person) would acquire (in the case of a tender offer or exchange offer,
if consummated), directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to
acquire beneficial ownership, or formation of any group which beneficially
owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 20% or more of any
class of capital stock of the Company or (E) any combination of the foregoing.

 

(ii) " _Superior Company Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ written Company
Takeover Proposal ( _provided_ , _that_ for purposes of this definition, the
applicable percentage in the definition of Company Takeover Proposal shall be
"50.1%" rather than "20% or more"), which the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor, and taking into account the legal, financial, regulatory, timing and
other aspects of such Company Takeover Proposal, the identity of the Person
making the proposal and any financing required for such proposal, the ability
of the Person making such proposal to obtain such required financing and the
level of certainty with respect to such required financing, and such other
factors that are deemed relevant by the Company Board, is more favorable to
the holders of Company Common Stock than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (after taking into account any revisions to the terms of this
Agreement that are committed to in writing by Parent (including pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 5.03(c)_).

(iii) " _Company Intervening Event_ " means any fact, circumstance,
effect, change, event or development that (A) is unknown to or by the Company
Board as of the date hereof (or if known, the magnitude or material
consequences of which were not known to or understood by the Company Board as
of the date of this Agreement), (B) becomes known to or understood by the
Company Board prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and (C) has
or would reasonably be expected to have a material beneficial effect on the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

SECTION 5.04 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates to, consummate the Financing,
or any Substitute Financing, in each case on the terms and conditions thereof
(as the same may be amended in accordance with the terms of this _Section_ __
_ 5.04_ and including any "market flex" provisions thereof) as promptly as
possible following the date of this Agreement (and, in any event, no later
than the Closing Date), including (i) (1) maintaining in effect the Debt
Letters and complying with all of their respective obligations thereunder and
(2) negotiating, entering into and delivering definitive agreements with
respect to the Financing reflecting the terms contained in the Debt Letters
(including any "market flex" provisions thereof) (or with other terms agreed
by Parent and the Financing Parties, subject to the restrictions on amendments
of the Debt Letters set forth below), so that such agreements are in effect no
later than the Closing, and (ii) satisfying on a timely basis all the
conditions to the Financing and the definitive agreements related thereto that
are applicable to Parent and its Affiliates that are within their control.

 



43 (b) In the event that all conditions set forth in  _Sections 7.01_ and
_7.03_ have been satisfied or waived or, upon funding shall be satisfied or
waived, Parent and its Affiliates shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the Persons providing the Financing (such Persons, or any other
financing sources and counterparties to any new or replacement financing,
including any Substitute Financing, entered into in accordance with the terms
hereof, the " _Financing Parties_ ") to fund the Financing in accordance
with its terms on the Closing Date, to the extent the proceeds thereof are
required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, and to enforce its rights under the Debt Letters in the event of any
breach by the Financing Parties of their funding obligations thereunder.
Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, take or refrain from
taking, directly or indirectly, any action that would reasonably be expected
to result in a failure of any of the conditions contained in the Debt Letters
or in any definitive agreement related to the Financing.

 

(c) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a current and
timely basis of the status of Parents efforts to obtain the Financing and to
satisfy the conditions thereof, including advising and updating the Company,
in a reasonable level of detail, with respect to status, proposed closing date
and material terms of the definitive documentation related to the Financing,
providing copies of substantially final drafts of the credit agreement and
other primary definitive documents ( _provided_ , _that_ any fee letter may be
redacted) and giving the Company prompt notice of any material breach or
default (or alleged or purported material breach or default) by any party to
the Debt Letters of which Parent has become aware or any termination or
repudiation (or alleged or purported termination or repudiation) of the Debt
Letters.

(d) Parent may amend, modify, terminate, assign or agree to any waiver
under the Debt Letters (including to add lenders, arrangers, agents,
bookrunners, managers and other financing sources) without the prior written
approval of the Company; provided, that Parent shall not, without Companys
prior written consent, permit any such amendment, modification, assignment,
termination or waiver to be made to, or consent to any waiver of, any
provision of or remedy under the Debt Letters which would (1) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees
to be paid or original issue discount unless Parent has available cash to fund
any additional fees or original issue discount without affecting Parents
ability to pay the Merger Consideration), other than such reductions in an
amount equal to the aggregate amount of (i) any debt or equity financing
(including equity forward arrangements) obtained by the Parent or its
Subsidiaries, (ii) any increase of the commitments under the existing
revolving credit facilities of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, (iii) any
commercial paper issuances by the Parent or its Subsidiaries and (iv) proceeds
of any asset sales of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, in each case, to the
extent such event occurs, (w) such event does not result in a mandatory
reduction of the amount of the Financing under the terms of the Debt Letter
(it being understood and agreed that any such mandatory reduction pursuant to
the terms of the Debt Letter shall not be deemed to be an amendment,
modification, assignment, termination or waiver of the Debt Letter subject to
the terms of

 



44  this _Section_ __ _ 5.04(d)_), (x) the cash proceeds of any such event are
received by Parent on or prior to the Effective Date or will be available to
Parent on the Effective Date on conditions that are no more onerous than the
conditions set forth in the Debt Letter, (y) solely with respect to any
reduction pursuant to clause (ii) above, such increase of the commitments
under the existing revolving credit facilities of the Parent or its
Subsidiaries shall be accompanied by a waiver of the financial covenant set
forth in Section 7.2(a) of the existing revolving credit agreement of the
Parent or such Subsidiary, as applicable, and (z) Parent intends to use such
cash proceeds to pay its obligations under this Agreement in lieu of proceeds
from the Financing contemplated by the terms of the Debt Letters, (2) impose
new or additional conditions to the Financing or (3) otherwise expand, amend,
modify or waive any provision of the Debt Letters in a manner that in any such
case would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or make less likely the funding
of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the
Closing Date, (B) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against the Financing Parties or any other parties to the Debt Letters or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto or (C) adversely affect
the ability of Parent to timely consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. In the event that new debt or equity
commitment letters or fee letters are entered into in accordance with any
amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of the Debt Letters
permitted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.04(d)_), such new commitment
letters or fee letters shall be deemed to be a part of the "Financing" and
deemed to be the "Debt Letters" for all purposes of this Agreement. Parent
shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any termination, amendment,
modification, waiver or replacement of the Debt Letters ( _provided_ , _that_
any fee letter may be redacted).

(e) If funds in the amounts set forth in the Debt Letters, or any portion
thereof, become unavailable except as a result of a reduction in commitments
under the Debt Letters as permitted under clause (d)(1) above, Parent shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event to (i) notify the Company in writing thereof, (ii)
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute financing sufficient to
enable Parent to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby in accordance with its terms (the " _Substitute Financing_ ") and
(iii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain a new financing commitment
letter that provides for such Substitute Financing and, promptly after
execution thereof, deliver to the Company true, complete and correct copies
of the new commitment letter and the related fee letters (in redacted form
reasonably satisfactory to the Persons providing such Substitute Financing
removing only fee amounts, pricing caps, rates and amounts included in the
"market flex", certain other economic provisions and certain other
confidential terms (none of which would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the conditionality, enforceability, termination or availability of the
Financing)) and related definitive financing documents with respect to such
Substitute Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such Substitute
Financing shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, (1)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing contemplated at such time
(including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount) or (2) impose new or additional conditions to the Financing or
otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any of the conditions of the
Financing, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent
the consummation of the Merger and the other

 



45  transactions contemplated hereby, as compared to the Debt Letters in effect
on the date hereof. Upon obtaining any commitment for any such Substitute
Financing, such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the "Financing" and
any commitment letter for such Substitute Financing shall be deemed the "Debt
Letters" for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

(f) Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, as the same shall become due and
payable, all fees and other amounts that become due and payable under the
Debt Letters.

(g) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that neither Parents
nor Merger Subs obligations hereunder are conditioned in any manner upon
Parent or Merger Sub obtaining the Financing, any Substitute Financing or any
other financing.

customary practice, including requesting that they provide customary consents
and comfort letters (including "negative assurance" comfort) to the extent

directors, officers or employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
as provided in their respective Organization Documents and any
indemnification or other similar Contracts of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, in each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms (it being
agreed that after the Closing such rights shall be mandatory rather than
permissive, if applicable), and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and the Company Subsidiaries to perform their respective obligations
thereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold
harmless each individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or who is as of the date of this Agreement,
or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the
request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director, officer or
employee of another Person (the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ "), against
all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any Claim, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or

 



56  investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and
actions contemplated hereby)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that
the Company Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director, officer or employee of
another Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. In the
event of any Claim covered under this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_, each Company
Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the
defense of any such Claim from Parent; _provided_ , _that_ (i) any Person
seeking advancement of expenses shall first provide an undertaking (if and
only to the extent required by applicable Law or the Surviving Corporations
Organizational Documents) to the Parent to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined by final adjudication that such person is not entitled
to indemnification and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in good
faith in the defense of any such matter.

 

(b) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the covenants and
agreements set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_.

(c) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in effect the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or provide
substitute policies for the Company and its current and former directors and
officers who are currently covered by the directors and officers and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company,
in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having other terms
not materially less favorable to the insured persons than the directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts
or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time (with insurance
carriers having at least an "A-" rating by A.M. Best with respect to
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance), except that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be
required to pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one
policy year more than 300% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid
by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ "),
and if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required
by this _Section_ __ _ 6.09(c)_ it shall obtain as much comparable insurance
as possible for the years within such six (6) year period for an annual
premium equal to the Maximum Amount, in respect of each policy year within
such period. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing Date the Company
may, at its option, purchase a "tail" directors and officers liability
insurance policy and fiduciary liability insurance policy for the Company and
its current and former directors, officers and employees who are

 



57  currently covered by the directors and officers and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company, such tail to provide
coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage and to have other
terms not materially less favorable to the insured persons than the directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts
or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time for a period of not
less than six (6) years; _provided_ , _that_ in no event shall the cost of any
such tail policy in respect of any one policy year exceed the Maximum Amount.
The Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force and
effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_ (i) shall survive
consummation of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the
Company Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives
and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract
or otherwise.

 

SECTION 6.10 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
two (2) year anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _Continuation Period_
"), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each
individual who is employed by the Company or a Company Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Effective Time and who remains employed thereafter by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company
Employee_ ") who is not a Represented Employee (as defined in _Section_ __ _
6.10(c)_) with (i) the same or better employment responsibilities in the same
location or within fifty (50) miles of the same location as held by the
Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless such Company
Employee consents to such change in employment responsibilities or location
change; (ii) a base salary or wage rate and short-term incentive compensation
target opportunities that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than that
provided to the Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; and
(iii) employee benefits that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate,
to those provided to the Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time. During the Continuation Period, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide each eligible Company Employee who
experiences a termination of employment by the Surviving Corporation without
"Cause" (excluding due to death or disability), or if applicable, by the
Company Employee for "Good Reason" (as each such term is defined under the
applicable severance arrangement) severance benefits that are no less than the
sum of (i) those applicable to an eligible Company Employee pursuant
to either (A) the Companys general severance benefit guidelines, (B) the
Companys Severance Plan for Executive Officers, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time or (C) an individual written agreement
that provides for severance payments during the Continuation Period and (ii)
continuation of base salary or wages for the balance of the Continuation
Period and continued payment of employer premiums for health benefits that an
eligible Company Employee elects to continue pursuant to COBRA; _provided_ ,
_that_ , the provisions of this sentence shall not

 



58  apply to the officers of the Company, Vectren Utility Holdings, Inc. and
subsidiaries of Vectren Utility Holdings, Inc. with an employment, change of
control, severance or similar agreement (whether or not such agreements are
triggered by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). A Company
Employee will not be eligible for severance benefits if such Company Employee
leaves voluntarily other than for "Good Reason", if applicable (including
voluntary resignation or retirement) or, is discharged due to misconduct,
including, but not limited to, a violation of employment policies of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation. Any severance benefits under this  _Section_ __ _
6.10_ shall be provided only if Company Employee executes and does not revoke
a release and waiver of all claims in favor of Parent, Surviving Corporation
and their Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation may terminate the employment of any Company Employee at any time,
with or without cause.

 

(b) With respect to annual cash bonuses payable under the Company Stock
Plan or the Vectren Incentive Plan for the fiscal year in which the Effective
Time occurs: (1) as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay each Company Employee
a pro-rated annual cash bonus for such fiscal year in an amount determined
based on the target annual cash bonus payable under the Company Stock Plan or
the Vectren Incentive Plan with such amount prorated based on the portion of
such fiscal year completed as of the Effective Time and (2) for the portion of
such fiscal year following the Effective Time each Company Employee who is
paid a pro-rated bonus under clause (1) above shall be eligible for a pro-
rated annual cash bonus with an annualized target value no less favorable than
the target annual cash bonus that such Company Employee was eligible
for immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to such performance
criteria as determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation. For the
avoidance of doubt, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the
discretionary bonus plans or historic practices maintained by Vectren
Infrastructure Services Company and Vectren Energy Services Company and
bonuses under such plans or historic practices shall be governed by the terms
of such plans or historic practices.

 

(c) With respect to each Company Employee (1) that receives a grant of 2018
Stock Units or 2019 Stock Units pursuant to the terms of _Section_ __ _
5.01(a)(v)_, a portion of which is cancelled upon the consummation of the
Merger pursuant to the terms of such grant, (2) who remains an employee of the
Surviving Company or a Company Subsidiary after the Effective Time and (3) is
equity-eligible (as determined by Parent in accordance with Parents
policies), Parent shall, promptly following the Effective Time, issue to such
Company Employee a replacement award on terms and conditions, including
performance criteria, as determined by Parent.

(d) With respect to each Company Employee who is covered by a Company
Union Contract (each, a " _Represented Employee_ "), Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to honor the Company Union
Contracts, in each case as in effect at the Effective Time, in accordance
with their terms (it being understood that this sentence shall not be
construed to limit the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend
or terminate any such Company Union Contract, to the extent permitted by the
terms of the applicable Company Union Contract and applicable Law).

 



59  The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ shall be subject to any
applicable provisions of the Company Union Contracts and applicable Law in
respect of such Represented Employee, to the extent the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.10_ are inconsistent with or otherwise in conflict with the
provisions of any such Company Union Contract or applicable Law.

 

(e) At the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, assume and honor in accordance with their terms all of the
Companys and all of the Company Subsidiaries employment, severance,
retention, termination and change-in-control plans, policies, programs,
agreements and arrangements (including any change-in-control severance
agreement or other arrangement between the Company and any Company Employee)
maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in each case, as in
effect at the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits
or rights arising as a result of the Merger (either alone or in combination
with any other event), it being understood that this sentence shall not be
construed to limit the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend
or terminate any such plans, policies, programs, agreements, or arrangements,
to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, policy, program,
agreement or arrangement and applicable Law; _provided_ , _that_ any such
amendment or termination shall not be inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement that specifically relate to such plans, policies, programs,
agreements, or arrangements. For purposes of any Company Benefit Plan or
Company Benefit Agreement set forth on _Section_ __ _ 3.09(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter containing a definition of "change in control," "change of
control" or similar term that relates to a transaction at the level of the
Company, the Closing shall be deemed to constitute a "change in control,"
"change of control" or such similar term.

(f) With respect to all employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, including any "employee benefit
plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) (including any vacation, paid
time-off and severance plans), each Company Employees service with the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (as well as service with any predecessor
employer of the Company or any such Company Subsidiary, to the extent service
with the predecessor employer was recognized by the Company or such Company
Subsidiary and is accurately reflected within a Company Employees records)
shall be treated as service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries for all purposes, including determining eligibility
to participate, level of benefits, vesting and benefit accruals, except (i)
to the extent that such service was not recognized under the corresponding
Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) for
purposes of any defined benefit plan accruals or (iii) to the extent that
such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for the same
period of service.

 

(g) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements and
waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries in which Company Employees
(and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after
the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting 

 



60  periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the corresponding
Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar
expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment limitations under
the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be eligible
to participate from and after the Effective Time.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this
Agreement, and no provision of this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ is intended to, or
shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any
employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and no Company
Personnel or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for
any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement or have the right
to enforce the provisions hereof including in respect of continued employment
(or resumed employment). Nothing contained herein shall alter the at-will
employment relationship of any Company Employee.

SECTION 6.11 _Merger Sub_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not engage in any
activity of any nature except for activities related to or in furtherance of
the Merger.

(b) Parent hereby (i) guarantees the due, prompt and faithful payment
performance and discharge by Merger Sub of, and compliance by Merger Sub with,
all of the covenants and agreements of Merger Sub under this Agreement and
(ii) agrees to take all actions necessary, proper or advisable to ensure such
payment, performance and discharge by Merger Sub hereunder.

SECTION 6.12 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute or similar
statute or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Merger, the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain such approvals and take
such actions to ensure that the Merger may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 6.13 _Actions Regarding Certain Company Plans_. Pursuant to the
Master Trust Agreement for the Indiana Energy, Inc. Unfunded Supplemental
Retirement Plan, effective May 1, 1999, as amended, the Master Trust Agreement
for the Indiana Energy, Inc. Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan,
effective May 1, 1999, as amended, the Company shall fund such trusts with the
use of Company funds prior to or contemporaneously with the Closing pursuant
to the terms of such trusts. The Company agrees to cause any third-party
administrator to be appointed pursuant to the terms of the aforementioned
trusts in this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ to an independent third party with
experience administering similar trusts and the fees payable to such
administrator to be reasonable and customary.

or the Company, on the other hand, commences a Claim that results in a
Judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.02(b)(ii)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)(iii)_ or any portion thereof, or a
Judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)(_

expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and the fees and expenses of
any expert or consultant engaged by the Company) in connection with such
Claim, together with interest on the amount of such payment from the date
such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the U.S.
prime rate as quoted by The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made. Any amount payable pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 8.02(b)_ shall be paid by the applicable Party by wire transfer of same-day
funds prior to or on the date such payment is required to be made under
_Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)_.

(d) Without limiting the rights of the Company under _Section_ __ _ 9.10_
prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01_,
if this Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which Parent is
obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee under _Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)(_
_i_ _)_ , except as otherwise contemplated by the last sentence of this
_Section_ __ _ 8.02(d)_, upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee, and,
if applicable, the costs and expenses of the Company pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 8.02(c)_ in accordance herewith, Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries and any of
the Financing Source Parties and their respective Affiliates
and Representatives shall have no further liability with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Financing, to
the Company or the holders of the Company Common Stock, and payment of the
applicable fee and such costs and expenses by Parent shall be the Companys
sole and exclusive remedy for any Claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys fees and disbursements, suffered or incurred by the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or any other Person in connection with this Agreement,
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Financing (and the
termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination,
and the Company shall not have, and expressly waives and relinquishes, any
other right, remedy or recourse (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
or whether at

 



68  law (including at common law or by statute) or in equity), including against
any Financing Source Party; _provided_ , _that_ , regardless of whether Parent
pays or is obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee, nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.02(d)_ shall release Parent from liability for a Willful
Breach of this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated under circumstances
in which the Company is obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee under
_Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)(iii)_, upon payment of
the Company Termination Fee and, if applicable, the costs and expenses of
Parent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.02(c)_ in accordance herewith, the
Company shall have no further liability with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives, and payment of the Company
Termination Fee and such costs and expenses by the Company shall be Parents
sole and exclusive remedy for any Claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys fees and disbursements, suffered or incurred by Parent,
Parents Subsidiaries and any other Person in connection with this Agreement,
the transactions contemplated hereby (and the termination thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination, and Parent and Merger Sub shall
not have, and each expressly waives and relinquishes, any other right, remedy
or recourse (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at
law (including at common law or by statute) or in equity); _provided_ ,
_that_ , regardless of whether the Company pays or is obligated to pay the
Company Termination Fee, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.02(d)_ shall
release the Company from liability for a Willful Breach of this Agreement.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Company or
Parent, as applicable, be required to pay the Company Termination Fee, the
Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than one occasion.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Willful Breach_ " means a breach
that is a consequence of a deliberate act or deliberate failure to act
undertaken by the breaching Party with the Knowledge that the taking of, or
failure to take, such act would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause or
constitute a material breach of any covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement; _provided_ , _that_ , without limiting the meaning of Willful
Breach, the Parties acknowledge and agree that any failure by any Party
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby after
the applicable conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article VII_ have been
satisfied or waived (except for those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions would be capable of being
satisfied at the time of such failure to consummate the Merger) shall
constitute a Willful Breach of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, (i)
in the event that all applicable conditions to the Closing set forth in
_Article VII_ have been satisfied or waived (except for those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions would be
capable of being satisfied at the time of such failure to consummate the
Merger) but Parent fails to close for any reason, such failure to close shall
be considered a Willful Breach and (ii) the availability or unavailability of
financing for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have no
effect on Parents obligations hereunder. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that, without in any way limiting the Parties rights under _Section_ __ _
9.10_, recoverable damages of the Company hereunder shall not be limited to
reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs but shall also include the
benefit of the bargain lost by the Company and its shareholders (including
"lost premium"), taking into consideration relevant

 



69  matters, including the total consideration and value to be received by the
shareholders of each Party under this Agreement and the time value of money,
which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of the Company and shall be
recoverable by the Company on behalf of itself or its shareholders.

 

SECTION 8.03 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at
any time before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (a) after receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further
approval by the shareholders of the Company without the further approval of
such shareholders, (b) no amendment shall be made to this Agreement after the
Effective Time, (c) except as provided above, no amendment of this Agreement
shall require the approval of the shareholders of Parent or the shareholders
of the Company and (d) no amendments to or waivers of any DFS Provision shall
be effective without the written consent of the Financing Parties. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the Parties.

SECTION 8.04 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the Parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (c) waive compliance with any covenants
and agreements contained herein or (d) waive the satisfaction of any of the
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 

SECTION 8.05 _Procedures for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_.
A termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01_, an
amendment of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.03_ or an extension
or waiver pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.04_ shall, in order to be
effective, require, in the case of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, action
by such Partys board of directors or the duly authorized designee of its
board of directors. Termination of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time
shall not require the approval of the shareholders of any Party. The Party
desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01_ shall
give written notice of such termination to the other Parties in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 9.02_, specifying the provision of this Agreement
pursuant to which such termination is effected.

option, include in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure
Letter, respectively, items that are not material in order to avoid any

any manner materially adverse to any Party or such Party waives its rights
under this _Section_ __ _ 9.05_ with respect thereto. Upon any determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being

so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.

more counterparts (including by means of facsimile or email in .pdf format),

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger. Except as
provided in the following two sentences (a) after

 



74  the Effective Time, the rights of the Companys shareholders and holders of
Company Stock Units, Company Other Performance Units or Company Unpaid
Performance Units to receive the Merger Consideration and payments pursuant
to _Article II_ , and (b) after the Effective Time, except for _Section_ __ _
6.09_, each Party agrees that (i) its respective representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the
other Parties, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement
and (ii) this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any
Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder, including the
right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
Financing Parties and each of their respective Affiliates and their respective
current, former and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling
persons, stockholders, agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or
limited partners, assignees or representatives (collectively, the " _Financing
Source Parties_ ") shall be express third-party beneficiaries with respect to
_Section_ __ _ 8.02(d)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.03(d)_, this _Section_ __ _
9.07_, _Section_ __ _ 9.08_, _Section_ __ _ 9.11(b)_,  _Section_ __ _
9.12_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.14_ (collectively, the " _DFS Provisions_ ").

 

SECTION 9.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all Claims or causes of
action of the Parties (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or
whether at law (including at common law or by statute) or in equity) that may
be based on, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution, performance or subject matter hereof, shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Indiana, without regard
to principles of conflict of laws, except as otherwise set forth in the Debt
Letters as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, all matters relating
to the interpretation, construction, validity and enforcement (whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort, or otherwise) against any of the
Financing Source Parties in any way relating to the Debt Letters or the
performance thereof or the Financing, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the domestic Law of the State of New York
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction that would cause
the application of Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

 

SECTION 9.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties. Any purported assignment without
such consent shall be void; _provided_ ,  _that_ Parent may make an
assignment of its rights (but not its obligations) under this Agreement to any
Financing Party without the prior written consent of the Company. Subject to
the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

 

SECTION 9.10 _Specific Enforcement_. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached and that monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, at any
time prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ ,
the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance
of terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the right of a Party to
cause each other Party to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in any court referred to in _Section_ __ _
9.11_, 

 



75  without proof of actual damages (and each Party hereby waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. The Parties further agree not to assert that a
remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. If any Party
brings any Claim to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement when expressly available to such Party pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, then, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the End Date shall automatically be extended by the period of
time between the commencement of such Claim and the date on which such Claim
is fully and finally resolved.

 

SECTION 9.11 _Jurisdiction; Venue_.

 

(a) All Claims arising from, under or in connection with this Agreement
shall be raised to and exclusively determined by the Commercial Courts of the
State of Indiana located in Marion County or, if such court disclaims
jurisdiction, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, to
whose jurisdiction and venue the Parties unconditionally consent and submit.
Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the
laying of venue of Claim arising out of this Agreement in such court and
hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agree not to plead
or claim in any such court that any such Claim brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each Party further agree that service
of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to
the respective addresses set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.02_ hereof shall be
effective service of process for any Claim brought against such Party in any
such court.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including
this  _Section_ __ _ 9.11_), each Party agrees that it will not bring or
support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim
of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Source Parties in any way
relating to this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of the Debt
Letters or the performance thereof or the Financing, in any forum other than
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom).

 

SECTION 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE MERGER (INCLUDING ANY PROCEEDING AGAINST THE FINANCING SOURCE
PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY,
THE DEBT LETTERS, THE FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES WITH RESPECT
THERETO). EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT

 



76  AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
9.12_.

 

SECTION 9.13 _Construction_. Each of the Parties has participated in the
drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is
drafted by all the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

SECTION 9.14 _Liability of Financing Source Parties_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company agrees that neither it
nor any other Company Related Party (other than Parent and the Merger Sub)
shall have any rights or claims against any Financing Source Parties in
connection with this Agreement, the Financing or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, and no Financing Source Parties shall have any rights or
claims against any Company Related Party (other than Parent and the Merger
Sub) in connection with this Agreement, the Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise; _provided_ , _that_ , following consummation of the Merger, the
foregoing will not limit the rights of the parties to the Financing under the
Debt Letters. In addition, in no event will any Financing Source Parties be
liable for consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or indirect damages
(including any loss of profits, business or anticipated savings) or damages
of a tortious nature.
