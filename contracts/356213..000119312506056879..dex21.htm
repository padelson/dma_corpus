ARTICLE II

Effects of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations;
Exchange of Certificates

Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder of any shares of Aztar Common Stock or Aztar
Preferred Stock (together, the " _Aztar Capital Stock_ ") or any capital
stock of Merger Sub:

(a) _Cancellation of Certain Aztar Common Stock and Aztar Preferred Stock_.
Each share of Aztar Common Stock or Aztar Preferred Stock that is owned by
Aztar shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(b) _Conversion of Aztar Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.02(e), each  



 

2  issued and outstanding share of Aztar Common Stock (other than shares to be
canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(a) and other than Aztar
Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.03(a)) shall be converted into the
right to receive $38.00 per share in cash (the " _Common Stock Merger
Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Aztar Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares of Aztar Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Common Stock
Merger Consideration to be paid therefor upon the surrender of such
certificate in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest.

(c) _Conversion of Aztar Preferred Stock_. Subject to Section 2.02(e), each
issued and outstanding share of Aztar Preferred Stock (other than shares to be
canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(a) and other than Aztar Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $401.90 per share in
cash, _provided_ that with respect to any share of Aztar Preferred Stock that
has elected to receive the liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid
dividends in accordance with the certification of designations, preferences
and rights of the Aztar Preferred Stock, each such share shall be converted
into the liquidation preference thereof plus accrued and unpaid dividends as
of the Effective Time (the " _Preferred Stock Merger Consideration_ " and
together with the Common Stock Merger Consideration, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). The liquidation preference of a share of Aztar Preferred
Stock is $100. As of the date hereof, the accrued and unpaid dividends
thereon were less than $180,000 in the aggregate. As of the Effective Time,
all such shares of Aztar Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Aztar Preferred
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration upon the surrender of such
certificate in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest.

(d) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. The aggregate of all shares of
the capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (of which, as of the date of this Agreement, 1000 shares of
common stock, par value $.01 per share, are issued and outstanding) shall be
canceled.

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Pinnacle shall enter into an
agreement with such bank or trust company as may be mutually agreed
by Pinnacle and Aztar (the " _Paying Agent_ "), pursuant to which Pinnacle
shall deposit with the Paying Agent at the Effective Time, for the benefit of
the holders of shares of Aztar Common Stock and Aztar Preferred Stock, for
exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the Paying Agent, cash
representing the Common Stock Merger Consideration payable to holders of
shares of Aztar Common Stock and cash representing the Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration payable to holders of shares of Aztar Preferred Stock (the "
_Payment Fund_ ").

(b) _Payment Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates that  



 

3  immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Aztar Common Stock or Aztar Preferred Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") whose
shares were converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to Section 2.01,
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Pinnacle may reasonably specify) and
(ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates in exchange for the
applicable Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, in the case of Certificates formerly representing shares of
Aztar Common Stock, the Common Stock Merger Consideration, without interest,
and in the case of Certificates formerly representing shares of Aztar
Preferred Stock, the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, without interest,
in each case that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II, and, in each case, the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Aztar Common Stock or Aztar Preferred Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of Aztar, the applicable Merger
Consideration may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name
the Certificate so surrendered is registered only if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment of the applicable Merger Consideration to a person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Pinnacle that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration,
which the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such
Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. No interest shall
be paid or will accrue on the Merger Consideration or any cash payable to
holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Aztar Capital Stock_. All cash payments of
Merger Consideration upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Aztar Common
Stock or Aztar Preferred Stock, as the case may be, theretofore represented
by such Certificates, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the stock transfer books of Aztar of the shares of Aztar Common Stock or
Aztar Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
Pinnacle, Aztar or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II, except as otherwise provided by law.

 

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Pinnacle, upon demand, and any
holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Pinnacle for payment of their claims
for Merger Consideration.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Pinnacle, Aztar or the Paying Agent or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall be liable to
any person in respect of any cash representing the Merger Consideration or any
cash from the Payment Fund, in each case  



 

4  delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have been
surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior
to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Authority (as defined in Section
3.01(d)), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of Pinnacle, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Payment Fund, as directed by Pinnacle, on a daily basis,
in Permitted Investments (as defined in Section 8.03) or as otherwise
consented to by Aztar prior to the Effective Time (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to Pinnacle.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Pinnacle and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any person who was a holder of Aztar Common Stock or Aztar Preferred Stock,
as the case may be, immediately prior to the Effective Time such amounts as
Pinnacle and the Paying Agent may be required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the " _Code_ ") or any other provision of applicable federal,
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Pinnacle or the Paying Agent and duly paid over to the applicable taxing
authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such consideration would
otherwise have been paid.

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Pinnacle, the posting by such person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Pinnacle may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement. 

(i) _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that Aztar changes the
number of shares of Aztar Common Stock or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Aztar Common Stock, or shares
of Aztar Preferred Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of Aztar Preferred Stock, issued and outstanding prior
to the Effective Time, in each case as a result of a reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or
other transaction, the applicable Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted.

Section 2.03 _Dissenting Shares_. Any holder of shares of Aztar Common Stock
or Aztar Preferred Stock who shall have exercised rights to dissent with
respect to the Merger in accordance with the DGCL and who has properly
exercised such holders rights to demand payment of the "fair value" of
the holders shares of Aztar Common Stock or Aztar Preferred  



 

5  Stock, as the case may be (the " _Aztar Dissenting Shares_ ") as provided in
the DGCL (the " _Aztar Dissenting Stockholder_ ") shall thereafter have only
such rights, if any, as are provided a dissenting stockholder in accordance
with the DGCL and shall have no rights to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.01; _provided_ , _however_ , that if a Aztar Dissenting
Stockholder shall fail to properly demand payment (in accordance with the
DGCL) or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such rights to relief as a
Aztar Dissenting Stockholder under the DGCL, then such Aztar
Dissenting Stockholders Aztar Dissenting Shares automatically shall cease to
be Aztar Dissenting Shares and shall be converted into and represent only the
right to receive, upon surrender of the Certificate representing the Aztar
Dissenting Shares, the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.01, without interest.

ARTICLE III

Representations and Warranties

Section 3.01 _Representations and Warranties of Aztar_. Except as and to the
extent set forth in the letter dated the date of this Agreement and delivered
to Pinnacle by Aztar concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement (the " _Aztar Disclosure Letter_ ") and, to the extent the
qualifying nature of such disclosure is readily apparent therefrom, except as
and to the extent set forth in the Aztar Reports (as defined in Section
3.01(e)) filed on or after January 1, 2006 and prior to the date hereof or in
Aztars definitive proxy statement for its 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders
(excluding, in each case, any disclosures set forth in any risk factor
section, in any section relating to forward looking statements and any other
disclosures included therein to the extent that they are cautionary,
predictive or forward-looking in nature), Aztar represents and warrants to
Pinnacle and Merger Sub as follows: 

(a) _Organization and Qualification_. Each of Aztar and its subsidiaries is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization and has full power and authority to conduct its
business as and to the extent now conducted and to own, use and lease its
assets and properties, except for such failures to be so organized, existing
and in good standing or to have such power and authority that, individually or
in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect (as defined in Section 8.03) on Aztar. Each of Aztar
and its subsidiaries is duly qualified, licensed or admitted to do business
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership, use or
leasing of its assets and properties, or the conduct or nature of its
business, makes such qualification, licensing or admission necessary, except
for such failures to be so qualified, licensed or admitted and in good
standing that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Aztar. Except as
set forth in Section 3.01(a) of the Aztar Disclosure Letter, none of Aztar or
any of its subsidiaries is a party to any agreement, arrangement or
understanding relating to the securities of Aztar or any of its subsidiaries,
including with respect to the voting, holding, issuance, purchase, sale or
registration thereof or entitling any party to any put or call rights, rights
of first offer, rights of first refusal, tag-along or drag-along rights or
any similar rights or obligations, or to any agreement, arrangement or
understanding providing for any governance, veto or similar rights with
respect to Aztar or any of its subsidiaries.



 

6 (b) _Capital Stock_.

(i) The authorized capital stock of Aztar consists of:

(A) 100,000,000 shares of Aztar Common Stock, of which 35,899,464 shares were
issued and outstanding as of the date of this Agreement; and 

(B) 100,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, of which
44,736.662 shares of Aztar Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding as of
the date of this Agreement.

As of March 10, 2006, 18,824,868 shares of Aztar Common Stock and no
shares of preferred stock were held in the treasury of Aztar.

(ii) A true and correct copy of each of the 1989 Stock Option and Incentive
Plan, 1999 Employee Stock Option and Incentive Plan, 2004 Employee Stock
Option and Incentive Plan, 1990 Nonemployee Directors Stock Option Plan and
2000 Nonemployee Directors Stock Option Plan, in each case as currently in
effect and reflecting all amendments thereto (collectively, the " _Aztar
Employee Stock Plans_ ") has been delivered to Pinnacle prior to the date
hereof. As of the date of this Agreement, (x) 3,592,996 shares of Aztar Common
Stock were subject to outstanding Aztar Employee Stock Options (as defined in
Section 5.04(a)) and (y) no shares of Aztar Common Stock were the subject of
other rights (whether contingent, accrued or otherwise), to acquire or receive
shares of Aztar Common Stock or benefits measured by the value of shares of
Aztar Common Stock or otherwise representing an award of any kind consisting
of shares of Aztar Common Stock under the Aztar Employee Stock Plans (the
items in this clause (y), the " _Aztar Awards_ "). The Aztar Employee Stock
Plans are the only plans or other obligations of Aztar or any of its
subsidiaries with respect to Aztar Awards or Aztar Employee Stock Options.
Aztar has no shares of capital stock reserved for issuance, except that, as
of March 10, 2006, there were an aggregate of 3,566,647 shares of Aztar Common
Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the Aztar Employee Stock Plans,
including 3,043,494 shares in respect of Aztar Employee Stock Options and no
shares in respect of Aztar Awards, an aggregate of 473,153 shares of Aztar
Common Stock reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Aztar Preferred
Stock and an aggregate of 50,000 shares of preferred stock reserved for
issuance in connection with the Rights Agreement (as defined in Section
3.01(p)). Section 3.01(b)(ii) of the Aztar Disclosure Letter contains a
correct and complete list as of March 10, 2006 of (i) the number of
outstanding Aztar Employee Stock Options under each of the Aztar Employee
Stock Plans, the holders of such Aztar Employee Stock Options (if such holder
is or was an executive officer of Aztar), the exercise price of all Aztar
Employee Stock Options and the number of shares of Aztar Common Stock
issuable at each such exercise price, and (ii) the number of outstanding Aztar
Awards under each of the Aztar Employee Stock Plans and the holders of such
Aztar Awards. From March 10, 2006 to the date hereof, Aztar has not issued
any shares of Aztar Common Stock except pursuant to the exercise of Aztar
Employee Stock Options and the settlement of Aztar Awards, in each case
outstanding on March 10, 2006, in accordance with their respective terms.
From March 10, 2006 through the date hereof, neither Aztar nor any of its
subsidiaries has granted or  



 

7  issued any Aztar Employee Stock Options or Aztar Awards. All Aztar Employee
Stock Options vest at the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of the
Aztar Employee Stock Plans as in effect on the date hereof.

(iii) All of the issued and outstanding shares of Aztar Common Stock are, and
all shares reserved for issuance will be, upon issuance in accordance with the
terms specified in the instruments or agreements pursuant to which they are
issuable, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. All
of the issued and outstanding shares of Aztar Preferred Stock are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

(iv) Except as disclosed in this Section 3.01(b) and except for this
Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, rights (including stock appreciation
rights), preemptive rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights or other
contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements, including any put or
call right or right of conversion or exchange under any outstanding security,
instrument or agreement (collectively, " _Options_ "), obligating Aztar or
any of its subsidiaries to acquire or purchase or to issue or sell any shares
of capital stock (or to make payments measured by the value of shares of
capital stock) or other securities of Aztar or any of its subsidiaries or any
securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for,
or giving any person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any capital stock
(or to make payments measured by the value of shares of capital stock) or
other securities of Aztar or any of its subsidiaries, or to grant, extend or
enter into any Option with respect thereto, and no securities or obligations
evidencing such rights or Options are authorized, issued or outstanding. No
Aztar subsidiary owns any shares of Aztar Common Stock or Aztar Preferred
Stock.

(v) Except as disclosed in Section 3.01(b)(v) of the Aztar Disclosure Letter,
all of the outstanding shares of capital stock and other securities of each
subsidiary of Aztar are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and are owned, beneficially and of record, by Aztar or a wholly
owned subsidiary, free and clear of any liens, claims, mortgages,
encumbrances, pledges, security interests, equities and charges of any kind
(each, a " _Lien_ "), except for any of the foregoing that, individually or
in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Aztar. Except as disclosed in Section 3.01(b)(v) of
the Aztar Disclosure Letter, there are no (A) outstanding Options obligating
Aztar or any of its subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock
of any subsidiary of Aztar or to grant, extend or enter into any such Option
or (B) voting trusts, proxies or other commitments,
understandings, restrictions or arrangements in favor of any person other
than Aztar or a wholly owned subsidiary of Aztar with respect to the voting of
or the right to participate in dividends or other earnings on any capital
stock of any subsidiary of Aztar. 

(vi) No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness or obligations of Aztar
or any of its subsidiaries having the right to vote (or which are convertible
into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) (collectively, "
_Aztar Voting Debt_ ") on any matters on which Aztar stockholders may vote are
issued or outstanding nor are there  



 

8  any outstanding Options obligating Aztar or any of its subsidiaries to issue
or sell any Aztar Voting Debt or to grant, extend or enter into any Option
with respect thereto. There are no securities convertible into or exercisable
for any such securities and no commitments or obligations to issue any of the
foregoing.

(c) _Authority_. The Aztar Board of Directors has unanimously (A) declared
that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are advisable
and has adopted this Agreement; (B) resolved to recommend adoption of this

_Material Contracts_ ").

A true and complete copy of each Material Contract has previously been
delivered or made available to Pinnacle. Except as individually or in the
aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on Aztar, each Contract by which Aztar or its subsidiaries is
bound is a valid and binding agreement of Aztar or one of its subsidiaries
enforceable against Aztar or one of its subsidiaries, and, to the knowledge of
Aztar, the counterparties thereto in accordance with its terms, subject to the
effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights
generally and to equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding at
law or in equity). Aztar and its subsidiaries are not (and to the knowledge
of Aztar, no counterparty is) in breach or violation of or in default in the
performance or observance of any term or provision of, and no event has
occurred which, with lapse of time or action by a third party or Aztar, would
result in a default under, any Contract to which Aztar or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound or to which any of
their property is subject, other than breaches, violations and defaults which
have not had and would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on Aztar.

(n) _Title to Assets_. Except as set forth in Section 3.01(n) of the Aztar
Disclosure Letter, Aztar and each of its subsidiaries has good and valid title
in fee simple to all their owned real property, as reflected in the most
recent balance sheet included in the Audited Financial Statements included in
the Aztar Reports, except for properties and assets that have been disposed of
in the ordinary course of business since the date of such balance sheet, free
and clear of all mortgages, liens, pledges, charges or encumbrances of any
nature whatsoever, except (i) liens for current taxes, payments of which are
not yet delinquent or are being disputed in good faith, (ii) such
imperfections in title and easements and encumbrances, if any, as are
not substantial in character, amount or extent and do not materially detract
from the value, or interfere with the present use, or Aztars intended use as
of the date hereof, of the property subject thereto or affected thereby, or
otherwise materially impair Aztars business operations (in the manner
presently carried on by Aztar or intended, as of the date hereof, to be
carried on by Aztar), or (iii) for such matters which have not had and would
not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
material adverse effect on Aztar. Aztar and each of its subsidiaries have good
and valid leasehold interests in all real property leased by them. All leases
under which Aztar or any of its subsidiaries leases any real or personal
property are in good standing, valid and effective against Aztar, and to
Aztars knowledge the counterparties thereto, in accordance with their
respective terms, is not and there is not, under any of such leases,
any existing default by Aztar, or to Aztars knowledge the counterparties
thereto, or event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
default by Aztar or to Aztars knowledge the counterparties thereto other than
failures to be in good standing, valid and effective and defaults under such
leases which have not had and would not reasonably be expected, individually
or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on Aztar.

Section 3.02 _Representations and Warranties of Pinnacle_. Except as and to
the extent set forth in the letter dated the date of this Agreement and
delivered to Pinnacle by Aztar concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement (the " _Pinnacle Disclosure Letter_ ") and, to the extent the
qualifying nature of such disclosure is readily apparent therefrom, except as
and to the extent set forth in the Pinnacle Reports (as defined in Section
3.02(f)) filed on or after January 1, 2005 and prior to the date hereof
(excluding any disclosures set forth in any risk factor section, in any
section relating to forward looking statements and any other disclosures
included therein to the extent that they are cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature), Pinnacle represents and warrants to Aztar as
follows: 

(a) _Financing Commitments_. Pinnacle has obtained written commitments (the "
_Financing Commitments_ ") for the financing necessary to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (including any
refinancing of indebtedness of Aztar or Pinnacle or any of their respective
subsidiaries which Pinnacle deems it advisable to refinance in connection
with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby) and to pay all associated fees, costs and expenses (the " _Financing_
"). Pinnacle has provided true, accurate and complete copies of
such commitments to Aztar. None of the Financing Commitments has been
amended, modified or terminated prior to the date of this Agreement, and the
respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, the Financing
Commitments are in full force and effect and (based on and assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of Aztar in this Agreement and
the compliance by Aztar with its obligations hereunder) no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time (other than the expiration of the
term thereof) or both, would constitute a default on the part of Pinnacle
under any of the Financing Commitments. There are no conditions precedent or
other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as set forth in or contemplated by the Financing
Commitments. The aggregate proceeds to be disbursed pursuant to the agreements
contemplated by the Financing Commitments, together with Pinnacles and
Aztars cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient for Pinnacle to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration and to consummate the Consent/Tender Offers, if
any (and any other repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in this
Agreement or the Financing Commitments), and to pay all related fees and
expenses. Based on and assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of Aztar in this Agreement and the compliance by Aztar with its
obligations hereunder, Pinnacle has no reason as of the date hereof to believe
that any of the conditions to  



 

23  the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments will not be
satisfied or that the Financing will not be made available to Pinnacle on or
prior the Closing Date. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Pinnacle from
amending or modifying the Financing Commitments or from seeking to raise
equity or other alternative sources of funds prior to the Closing, as long as
such amendment or modification or other action does not prevent, delay or
reduce the likelihood of the consummation of the Merger.

(b) _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time and after giving effect to all of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment of the
aggregate Merger Consideration, the Financing, consummation of the
Consent/Tender Offers, if any (and any other repayment or refinancing of debt
contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing Commitments), and payment of
all related fees and expenses, and assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Aztar in this Agreement and the compliance
by Aztar with its obligations hereunder, the Surviving Corporation (on a
combined basis with its subsidiaries) will be solvent (as defined in Section
8.03).

(c) _Organization_. Each of Pinnacle and its subsidiaries is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization and has full power and authority to conduct its business as and
to the extent now conducted and to own, use and lease its assets and
properties, except for such failures to be so organized, existing and in good
standing or to have such power and authority that, individually or in
the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect (as defined in Section 8.03) on Pinnacle. Each of
Pinnacle and its subsidiaries is duly qualified, licensed or admitted to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership,
use or leasing of its assets and properties, or the conduct or nature of its
business, makes such qualification, licensing or admission necessary, except
for such failures to be so qualified, licensed or admitted and in good
standing that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Pinnacle.

(d) _Authority_. Each of Pinnacle and Merger Sub has full corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by Pinnacle and Merger Sub and the
consummation by Pinnacle and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly and validly unanimously adopted and approved by the
Board of Directors of Pinnacle and Merger Sub and by Pinnacle as the sole
shareholder of Merger Sub. No other corporate proceedings on the part of
Pinnacle, Merger Sub or their stockholders are necessary to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Pinnacle or Merger
Sub and the consummation by Pinnacle and Merger Sub of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Pinnacle and Merger Sub and constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Pinnacle and Merger Sub enforceable
against Pinnacle and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms.

(e) _No Conflicts; Approvals and Consents_.

declarations, approvals, permits or authorizations (A) required by the
Secretary of the

declarations, reports or other filings are required to be made by Aztar with,
nor are any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations

the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Financing, or in connection with the continuing operation of the business of
Pinnacle and its subsidiaries following the Effective Time, except those that
the failure to make or obtain, individually or in the aggregate, have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
Pinnacle.

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Pinnacle do
not, and the consummation by Pinnacle of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Financing, will not,
constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Pinnacle or the comparable
governing documents of any of its subsidiaries; (B) with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of
termination) or default under, the creation or acceleration of any obligations
under or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of Pinnacle or any of
its subsidiaries pursuant to any Contract binding upon Pinnacle or any of its
subsidiaries or, assuming (solely with respect to performance of this
Agreement and consummation by Pinnacle of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby) compliance with the matters referred to in
Section 3.02(e)(i), any Law or governmental or non-governmental permit or
license to which Pinnacle or any of its subsidiaries is subject; or (C)
any change in the rights or obligations of any party under any Contract
binding upon Pinnacle or any of its subsidiaries (including, without
limitation, any change in pricing, term, put or call rights, rights of first
offer, rights of first refusal, tag-along or drag-along rights or any similar
rights or obligations which may be exercised in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby), except in the case of clause (B)

regulations thereunder, except for filings the failure of which to make or
the failure of which to make in compliance with all applicable requirements of
the applicable statute and the rules and regulations thereunder, individually

Pinnacle in obtaining any consents or waivers to, and in respect of, any of
its indebtedness, _provided_ that Aztar shall not be required to permit any of

reasonable best efforts to commence consent solicitations or issuer tender or
exchange offers with respect to their respective indebtedness as and at the
times that Pinnacle shall request (" _Consent/Tender Offers_ ") in each case
with the cooperation of Pinnacle. All Consent/Tender Offers shall be in
accordance  



 

32  with applicable Law and shall be on the terms and conditions reasonably
agreed by Pinnacle and Aztar; _provided_ , _that_ all Consent/Tender
Offers (and all obligations to make any payments to holders of all or any
portion of any indebtedness in connection therewith or to modify the terms or
provisions of any indebtedness) shall be conditioned upon the consummation of
the Merger, and shall terminate immediately upon the termination of this
Agreement prior to the Effective Time. Aztar agrees not to consummate any

employees, representatives and advisors in connection with their respective
obligations pursuant to Section 4.01(b) and 4.01(c) shall be borne (or
reimbursed promptly following demand therefor) by Pinnacle. Nothing in Section
4.01(b) or 4.01(c) shall require Aztar or any of its subsidiaries, officers,
employees, representatives or advisors to take any action that might result
in any liability in connection with the Financing unless indemnified by
Pinnacle to the maximum extent permitted by Law or to take any action other
than in their capacity as an officer. Pinnacle hereby agrees and acknowledges
that Financing and the Consent/Tender Offers do not constitute conditions to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this agreement.

Section 4.02 _Covenants of Pinnacle Interim Operations_. Pinnacle will not
take, and will not permit its subsidiaries to take, any action that at the
time of taking such action is reasonably likely to prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the Merger. Pinnacle agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the Financing necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby at or prior to the Closing Date.

representative retained by it or any of its subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing non-public information), or knowingly take any other action
designed to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes a Takeover Proposal (as defined below) or (ii) participate in
any negotiations or discussions (other than to state that they  



 

33  are not permitted to have discussions) regarding any Takeover Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if, at any time prior to receipt of
the Stockholder Approval (the " _Applicable Period_ "), the Board of
Directors of Aztar determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal
and financial advisors, that a Takeover Proposal that was not solicited by it
after the date hereof and that did not otherwise result from a breach of this
Section 4.03(a) is, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal
(as defined in Section 4.03(b)), and subject to providing prior written notice
of its decision to take such action to Pinnacle and compliance with Section
4.03(c), Aztar may (x) furnish information with respect to Aztar and its
subsidiaries to the person making such proposal (and its representatives)
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement ( _provided_ , that such
confidentiality agreement shall not in any way restrict Aztar from complying
with its disclosure obligations under this Agreement, including with respect
to such proposal; _provided further_ , that any such confidentiality
agreement need not contain a standstill or similar provision) and (y)
participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such proposal. Aztar
agrees to provide Pinnacle with any information provided in writing or orally
to the person making such Takeover Proposal and its representatives
substantially simultaneously with the provision thereof to such other person.
Aztar, its subsidiaries and their representatives immediately shall cease
and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations with
any parties existing on the date hereof with respect to any Takeover Proposal.
For purposes of this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any bona fide
inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to (i) any direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of a business (a " _Material Business_ ")
that constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or the assets
(including equity securities) of Aztar and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, (ii) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of
any class of voting securities of Aztar or 20% or more of the voting power of
any class of stock of any subsidiary of Aztar owning, operating or
controlling a Material Business, (iii) any tender offer or exchange offer (or
other offer to purchase or acquire) that if consummated would result in any
person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of voting securities of
Aztar or 20% or more of the voting power of any class of stock of any
subsidiary of Aztar owning, operating or controlling a Material Business, (iv)
any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Aztar or any such
subsidiary of Aztar owning, operating or controlling a Material Business or
(v) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of, any joint venture or
partnership or similar arrangement involving, or any recapitalization,
restructuring or leveraged financing or similar transaction involving all or
any portion of the Las Vegas Site (except as expressly specified in Section
4.01(a)(xii), in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) Except as contemplated by this Section 4.03, neither the Board of
Directors of Aztar nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Pinnacle, the
approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or such committee of
this Agreement or the Merger, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly
to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal, or (iii) cause Aztar to enter

other similar agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement of the type
and under the circumstances described in Section 4.03(a)) related to any
Takeover Proposal (each, a " _Aztar Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in response to a Takeover Proposal that was not solicited by
it and that did not otherwise result from a breach of Section 4.03(a), during
the Applicable Period, the Board of Directors of Aztar may, if it determines
in good faith, after consulting with outside counsel, that taking such action
is reasonably required by the Board  



 

34  of Directors fiduciary obligations under applicable law, (A) withdraw or
modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, the approval
or recommendation by such Board of Directors or any committee thereof of this
Agreement or the Merger, (B) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, any Superior Proposal, or (C) terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.01(d) simultaneously with the payment of the Termination Fee and
the Termination Expenses, but only after (1) such Board of Directors has
determined in good faith that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, and (2) (I) Aztar has notified Pinnacle in writing of the
determination that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and
(II) at least three business days following receipt by Pinnacle of such
notice, the Board of Directors of Aztar has determined that such Superior
Proposal remains a Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, other
than in connection with a Takeover Proposal, the Board of Directors of Aztar
may, if it determines in good faith, after consulting with outside counsel,
that the failure to take such action would result in a breach of the Board of
Directors fiduciary obligations under applicable Law withdraw or modify the
approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or any committee
thereof of this Agreement or the Merger if Aztar has notified Pinnacle in
writing of the decision to do so at least three business days prior to the
taking of such action, which notice shall specify in writing the reasons
therefor. 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means any written
Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of Aztar determines in good
faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized

strategic considerations, including relevant legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of such Takeover Proposal and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement deemed relevant by the Board of
Directors, (ii) the identity of the third party making such Takeover
Proposal, (iii) the anticipated timing, conditions and prospects for
completion of such Takeover Proposal, including the prospects for obtaining
regulatory approvals and financing, and any third party shareholder approvals
and (iv) the other terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal) to Aztars
stockholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (taking into account all of the terms of any proposal by Pinnacle to
amend or modify the terms of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), except that (x) the reference to "20%" in
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the definition of "Takeover Proposal" in
Section 4.03(a) shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%", (y) the "Takeover
Proposal" must refer to a transaction involving Aztar as a whole, and not any
of its subsidiaries or Material Businesses or the Las Vegas Site, and (z) the
references to any subsidiary of Aztar owning, operating or controlling a
Material Business in clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) shall be deemed to be
deleted.

(c) In addition to the obligations of Aztar set forth in paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this Section 4.03, Aztar shall as promptly as practicable advise
Pinnacle, orally and in writing, of any request for information or of any
Takeover Proposal (and in any case within 24 hours of such request or the
receipt of such Takeover Proposal), the principal terms and conditions of such
request or Takeover Proposal and the identity of the person making
such request or Takeover Proposal. Aztar shall keep Pinnacle informed of the
status and material details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of
any such request or Takeover Proposal as promptly as practicable.

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Aztar from issuing a  



 

35  "stop-look-and-listen communication" pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f), taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position as required by Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or taking any action required by any
order or decree of a Governmental Authority, in each case, subject to the
provisions of Section 7.01(f).

Section 4.04 _Other Actions_. Each of Aztar and Pinnacle shall use its
reasonable best efforts not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts not
to permit any of their respective subsidiaries to, take any action that would,
or that would reasonably be expected to, result in any condition to the Merger
set forth in Article VI not being satisfied.

Section 4.05 _Control of Aztar s Operations _. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give to Pinnacle, directly or indirectly, rights to control
or direct Aztars operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, Aztar shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, complete control and supervision of its operations.

other in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement and, as required by law, in disseminating
the information contained in such amendment or supplement to
Aztars stockholders. Aztar shall provide Pinnacle with a reasonable

Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the " _Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the

obligations and upon reasonable advance notice, Aztar shall, and shall cause
each of its respective subsidiaries to afford to Pinnacle and to its
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives (and to its potential financing sources and their respective
representatives) reasonable access during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Effective Time to all its Contracts, properties, books,
contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during such period, to the

its business, properties and personnel, in each case as Pinnacle may
reasonably request. Pinnacle shall schedule and coordinate all inspections
with the individual(s) set forth in Section 5.02(a) of the Aztar Disclosure

times during any such inspection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Aztar nor its subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose any information (i) where such access or disclosure could jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege or work product privilege of Aztar or its
subsidiaries or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement, or (ii) to the extent that outside counsel to
Aztar advises that such access or disclosure should not be disclosed in order
to ensure compliance with any Gaming Law or other applicable Law. Pinnacle
agrees to hold confidential all information which it has received or to which
it has gained access pursuant to this Section 5.02(a) in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of March 11, 2006 between Aztar and
Pinnacle (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(a) _Regulatory Approvals_. Each party hereto shall cooperate and promptly
prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all
necessary applications, notices, petitions and filings, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things in order to obtain all approvals and
authorizations of all Governmental Authorities, necessary or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner reasonably
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Pinnacle shall have the responsibility for the preparation
and filing of any required applications, filings or other materials,
including in the State of New Jersey, a trust agreement necessary to obtain
interim casino authorization; _provided however_ that Aztar shall provide and
cause its affiliates to provide Pinnacle with any information required in
connection with such filings as promptly as practicable; and Aztar shall have
the right to review and approve (which comments Aztar shall provide as
promptly as practicable, but in any event within three days of Pinnacles
request for such approval) in advance all characterizations of the information
relating to Aztar that appear in any application, notice, petition or filing
made in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Aztar and Pinnacle agree that they will consult and cooperate
with each other with respect to the obtaining of all such necessary approvals
and authorizations of Governmental Authorities.

(b) _Filings_. Each of Pinnacle and Aztar undertakes and agrees to file as
soon as practicable a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with the
United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust
Division_ ") and to make such filings and apply for such approvals
and consents as are required under the Gaming Laws as soon as practicable
after the date hereof (and in any event within 45 days), including the filing
of all required applications for Pinnacle and all "key persons" (as defined

reasonable best efforts to request as soon as practicable an accelerated
review (to the extent available) from any Gaming Authorities in connection
with such filings and in the case of Gaming Approvals required in the State
of New Jersey, Pinnacle shall seek to obtain interim casino authorization at
the earliest practicable date. Each of Pinnacle and Aztar shall respond as
promptly as practicable under the circumstances to any inquiries received
from the FTC or the Antitrust Division or any authority enforcing applicable
Gaming Laws for additional information or documentation and to all inquiries
and requests received from any Governmental Authority in connection with
any Law. Pinnacle shall have the exclusive right to direct and control the
process of obtaining the Governmental Consents (as defined below) required in
connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and Aztar
agrees to reasonably cooperate with Pinnacle with respect thereto. Aztar
shall agree if, but solely if, requested by Pinnacle to, in compliance with
Gaming Laws, divest, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any
action that limits or prohibits Aztars or Pinnacles freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services,
employees or assets of Aztar or any of its subsidiaries, in each case at or
after the Effective Time and only in order to enable Pinnacle to obtain a
Governmental Consent, _provided_ that any such action shall be conditioned
upon the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) _Cooperation_. In addition, each party shall, subject to applicable law
and to the terms and conditions hereof, except as prohibited by
any applicable representative of any applicable governmental entity, (i)
promptly notify the other party of any material communication to that party
relating to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby  



 

38  from the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any Governmental Authority, including
any Gaming Authorities, and, consult with the other party in advance
regarding any material proposed written communication relating to the Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby to any of the foregoing in response
thereto; and (ii) furnish the other party or its outside counsel with copies
of all material correspondence, filings, and written communications (and
memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between them and its affiliates
and their respective representatives on the one hand, and any government or
regulatory authority or members of their respective staffs on the other hand,
with respect to this Agreement and the Merger, _provided_ , _however_ , that
the parties may redact discussions of the value of the Merger or any other
acquisition, sale, or divestiture; provided, further, that notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Pinnacle shall not be required to
provide Aztar with copies of any individual gaming applications and shall be
entitled to redact any corporate gaming applications to the extent reasonable
to do so under the circumstances. Aztar will not, and will not permit any of
its representatives to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion
with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation
or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Merger without the consent of
Pinnacle, unless requested by such Governmental Authority and upon prior
written notice by Aztar to Pinnacle of such request.

(d) _Objections_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
parties contained in Section 5.03(a), (b) and (c), but subject to Section
5.03(g), each of Pinnacle and Aztar shall use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by a Governmental
Authority or other person with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby under any Antitrust Law or Gaming Law or by any Gaming Authority. In
connection with the foregoing, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, Gaming Law or the rules and
regulations of any Gaming Authority, subject to Section 5.03(g), each of
Pinnacle and Aztar shall cooperate in all material respects with each other
and use its respective reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable,
contest and resist any such action or proceeding, to limit the scope or effect
of any proposed action of, or remedy sought to be obtained or imposed by, any
Gaming Authority, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) _Further Actions_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
reasonably necessary or advisable under applicable Laws (including the HSR Act
and the Gaming Laws) to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner reasonably practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) obtaining any required third
party consents and Governmental Consents and (ii) the execution and delivery
of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 



 

39 (f) _Governmental Consents_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Governmental Consents_ " shall mean all notices, reports, filings, consents,
applications, registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations required to
be made prior to the Effective Time by Aztar or Pinnacle or any of their
respective subsidiaries with, or obtained prior to the Effective Time by
Aztar or Pinnacle or any of their respective subsidiaries from, any
Governmental Authority in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (and shall include the expiration or termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act).

(g)  _Specified Material Adverse Effect_. Notwithstanding the foregoing (but
subject to the last sentence of Section 5.03(b)), as used in this Section
5.03, "reasonable best efforts" shall not include nor require any party
to (A) sell, or agree to sell, hold or agree to hold separate, or otherwise
dispose, or agree to dispose of, any asset, in each case other than any hotel
casino property outside the State of Nevada owned by Aztar that represents
less than 20% of Aztars revenue for the year ending December 31, 2005 (the "
_Specified Assets_ ")or (B) conduct or agree to conduct its business in any
particular manner, if such conduct has had or would, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to (i) have a material adverse effect
on Pinnacle (after giving effect to the consummation of the Merger and
reflecting the business, assets, results of operations and financial condition
of Aztar and its subsidiaries) (clauses (A) or (B), a " _Specified Material
Adverse Effect_ ") or (ii) result in either Pinnacle or Aztar or their
respective subsidiaries failing to meet the standards for licensing,
suitability or character under any Gaming Laws relating to the conduct of
Pinnacles or Aztars business which (after taking into account the
anticipated impact of such failure to so meet such standards on other
authorities) would reasonably be expected to have a Specified Material
Adverse Effect. None of Aztar or any of its subsidiaries may take or agree to
take any action, or consent to or agree to consent to any such restriction
without the consent of Pinnacle. For purposes of clarification,
Pinnacle agrees that if necessary in order to obtain the Required
Governmental Consents (as defined in Section 6.01(c)), Pinnacle will (A) sell,
or agree to sell, hold or agree to hold separate, or otherwise dispose, or
agree to dispose of, the Specified Assets or (B) conduct or agree to conduct
its business in a particular manner unless such conduct has had or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Specified Material Adverse Effect.

(h) _State Anti-Takeover Statutes_. Without limiting the generality of Section
5.03(b), Aztar and Pinnacle shall (i) take all reasonable action necessary to
ensure that no state anti-takeover statute or similar statute or regulation or
charter, bylaw or similar provision becomes applicable to the Merger, this
Agreement or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(ii) if any state anti-takeover statute or similar statute or regulation,
charter, bylaw or similar provision becomes applicable to the Merger, this
Agreement or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, take all
action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as reasonably
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation, charter, bylaw or similar
provision on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



 

40 Section 5.04 _Stock Options; Stock Plans_.

(a) Each stock option to purchase Aztar Common Stock (the " _Aztar Employee
Stock Options_ ") granted under the Aztar Employee Stock Plans that is
outstanding as of or immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any,
of the Common Stock Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Aztar
Common Stock subject to such Aztar Employee Stock Option and (y) the total
number of shares of Aztar Common Stock subject to such Aztar Employee Stock
Option immediately before the Effective Time, with the aggregate amount of
such payment rounded to the nearest cent, less such amounts as are required to
be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state, U.S.
local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment;

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Aztar (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Aztar Employee Stock Plans)
shall adopt such resolutions or take all such other actions as may be required
to effect the foregoing and shall ensure that following the Effective Time no
holder of Aztar Employee Stock Option or any participant in any Aztar
Employee Stock Plan or other Aztar Employee Benefit Plan or Aztar Employment
Agreement shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock
(including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) of Aztar or
the Surviving Corporation.

Section 5.05 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Pinnacle agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the employees
of Aztar and any of its subsidiaries who are employed as of the Closing Date
and continue employment (the " _Company Employees_ ") will continue to be
provided with salary and benefits under employee benefit and commission or
similar plans that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, to those
currently provided by Aztar or any of its subsidiaries to such employees;
_provided_ that discretionary benefits shall remain discretionary.

(b) For purposes of all employee benefit plans, programs and agreements
maintained by or contributed to by Pinnacle and its subsidiaries
(including, after Closing, the Surviving Corporation), Pinnacle shall, or
shall cause its subsidiaries to cause each such plan, program or arrangement
to treat the prior service with Aztar or any of its subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Closing of any Company Employee (to the same extent such service
is recognized under analogous plans, programs or arrangements of Aztar or any
of its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time) as service rendered to
Pinnacle or any of its subsidiaries, as the case may be, for all purposes;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service shall not (i) operate
to duplicate any benefit or the funding of such benefit under any plan, (ii)
require the crediting of past service for benefit accrual purposes under any
defined benefit pension plan or (iii) be credited if past service credit has
not been or will not be provided to employees of Pinnacle or its subsidiaries
participating in such plan. Company Employees shall also be given credit for
any deductible or co-payment amounts paid in respect of the plan year in which
the Closing occurs, to the extent that, following the Closing, they
participate in any other plan for which deductibles or co-payments are
required. Pinnacle shall also cause each Pinnacle Plan (as defined below) to
waive any preexisting condition or waiting period limitation which would
otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee on or after the Effective Time
(to the extent such limitation  



 

41  would not apply under the corresponding Aztar Employee Benefit Plan).
Pinnacle shall recognize any accrued but unused vacation of the Company
Employees as of the Effective Time, and Pinnacle shall cause Aztar and its
subsidiaries to provide such paid vacation. For purposes of this Agreement, a
" _Pinnacle Plan_ " shall mean such employee benefit plan, as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA, or a nonqualified employee benefit or deferred
compensation plan, stock option, bonus or incentive plan or other employee
benefit or fringe benefit program, that may be in effect generally for
employees of Pinnacle and its subsidiaries from time to time.

(c) Except as provided specifically in this Section 5.05, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit or restrict the rights of Pinnacle or Aztar to modify,
amend, terminate or establish employee benefit plans or arrangements, in whole
or in part, at any time after the Effective Time.

(d) No provision of this Section 5.05 shall create any third party beneficiary
rights in any Company Employee or any current or former director or consultant
of Aztar or its subsidiaries in respect of continued employment (or resumed
employment) or any other matter.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Pinnacle shall
or shall cause its affiliates to honor and perform all obligations under any
collective bargaining agreements pertaining to any Company Employees.

(f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Pinnacle
shall not, for at least six months following the Closing cause there to be
adopted any amendment to any Aztar Employee Benefit Plan that is a severance
or retention plan, program, policy or agreement that would result in a
diminution of benefits thereunder.

Section 5.06  _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

(a) Each of Aztar and Pinnacle agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law, all rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers, employees
or fiduciaries under benefit plans currently indemnified of Aztar and its
subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificate or articles of
incorporation, by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) or other
agreements providing indemnification shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. The
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall
continue to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present
directors and officers than are presently set forth in the Aztars certificate
of incorporation and by-laws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such
individuals.

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain in effect the directors and officers liability (and fiduciary)
insurance policies covering acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the
Effective Time with respect to those persons who  



 

42  are currently covered by Aztars respective directors and officers
liability (and fiduciary) insurance policies on terms with respect to such
coverage and in amounts at least as favorable as those set forth in the
relevant policy in effect on the date of this Agreement, except in no event
shall the Surviving Corporation be required to make annual premium payments in
connection therewith in excess of the amount set forth on Section 5.06(b) of
the Aztar Disclosure Letter (the "Maximum Amount"), and if the Surviving
Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section
5.06(b), the Surviving Corporation shall maintain the most advantageous
policies of directors and officers insurance otherwise obtainable for an
annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
either Pinnacle or Aztar may elect in lieu of the foregoing insurance, prior
to the Effective Time, to obtain and fully pay for a policy (providing only
for the Side A coverage for the Aztar Indemnified Parties (as defined in
clause (c) below) with a claims period of at least six years from the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as Aztars current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance in an amount and scope the same as Aztars existing
policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time; provided that the cost thereof does not exceed $4,435,000.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Pinnacle agrees to cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each present or former
director and officer of Aztar or any of its subsidiaries (in each case, for
acts or failures to act in such capacity), determined as of the date hereof,
and any person who becomes such a director or officer between the date hereof
and the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Aztar Indemnified Parties_ "),
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, "
_Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law (and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, _provided_ that if required
by applicable law the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
person is not entitled to indemnification).

(d) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.06 shall
not be terminated or modified by such parties in a manner so as to adversely
affect any Aztar Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to the benefit
of Sections 5.06(a) and (b), as the case may be, to whom this Section 5.06
applies without the consent of the affected Aztar Indemnified Party or such
other person, as the case may be. If the Surviving Corporation (i) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such
case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in Section 5.06.

(e) The provisions of Section 5.06 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his
or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may
have by contract or otherwise.



 

43 Section 5.07 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) Except as provided in this Section 5.07 or Section 4.01(d), all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

(b) In the event that (i) following the Stockholder Approval, a Takeover
Proposal (or the intention of any person to make one), whether or not
conditional, shall have been made known to Aztar or shall have been publicly
disclosed and thereafter (x) this Agreement is terminated by Aztar or Pinnacle
pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) and (y) within 6 months of such termination
Aztar or any of its subsidiaries enters into any Aztar Acquisition Agreement
or any person consummates any Takeover Proposal, (ii) prior to or during the
Stockholders Meeting (or any subsequent meeting of Aztar stockholders at which
it is proposed that the Merger be approved), a Takeover Proposal (or
the intention of any person to make one), whether or not conditional, shall
have been publicly disclosed, and thereafter (x) this Agreement is terminated
by either Aztar or Pinnacle pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(ii) and (y) within 9
months of such termination Aztar or any of its subsidiaries enters into any
Aztar Acquisition Agreement or any person consummates any Takeover Proposal,
(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Aztar pursuant to Section 7.01(d), (iv)
this Agreement is terminated by Pinnacle pursuant to Section 7.01(f)(i) and
within 9 months of such termination Aztar or any of its subsidiaries enters
into any Aztar Acquisition Agreement or any person consummates any Takeover
Proposal, (v) this Agreement is terminated by Pinnacle pursuant to Section
7.01(f)(ii), or (vi) this Agreement is terminated by Pinnacle pursuant to
Section 7.01(g) as a result of a material and intentional breach by Aztar,
then in each case Aztar shall pay Pinnacle a fee equal to $42 million (the "
_Termination Fee_ ") and shall reimburse Pinnacle for its fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby up to a
maximum of $13 million (the "Termination Expenses"), payable by wire transfer
of same day funds; (for the purposes of the foregoing the terms " _Aztar
Acquisition Agreement_ " and " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall have the meanings
assigned to such terms in Section 4.03 except that the references to "20%" in
the definition of "Takeover Proposal" in Section 4.03(a) shall be deemed to be
references to "50%". Payment of the Termination Fee and Termination Expenses
to Pinnacle pursuant to (A) clauses (i), (ii) or (iv) above shall be made
concurrently with the earlier of the consummation of the Takeover Proposal or
the entry of the Aztar Acquisition Agreement, (B) clause (iii) above shall be
made concurrently with termination of this Agreement or (C) clause (v) or (vi)
above shall be made within two business days of termination of this Agreement.

(c) Aztar acknowledges that the agreement contained in Section 5.07(b) is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without this agreement, Pinnacle would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if Aztar fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to Section
5.07, and, in order to obtain such payment, Pinnacle commences a suit that
results in a judgment against Aztar for the payments set forth in Section
5.07, Aztar shall pay to Pinnacle its costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amount of the fee at the prime rate plus 2% per annum of Citibank N.A. in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made.



 

44 Section 5.08 _Public Announcements_. Aztar and Pinnacle will consult with each
other before issuing, and provide each other the reasonable opportunity to
review, comment upon and concur with, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except as any party, after
consultation with counsel, determines is required by applicable law or
applicable rule or regulation of the NYSE.

Section 5.09 _Aztar Headquarters_. For a period of not less than 9 months
following the Effective Time, Pinnacle shall maintain the
current headquarters of Aztar in Phoenix, Arizona as a divisional
headquarters. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein, shall be
deemed to obligate Pinnacle or any of its subsidiaries to employ any
individual or group of individuals at such location after the Closing.

may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 6.01, 6.02 or

partys failure to use reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent required

ARTICLE VII

Termination, Amendment and Waiver

Section 7.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior

(b) by either Aztar or Pinnacle:

(i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated by the 12-month anniversary
of the date of this Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any party whose failure to

set forth in Section 6.02 (in the case of Aztar) or in Section 6.03 (in the
case of Pinnacle) becomes incapable of satisfaction prior to the Termination
Date; _provided_ that the failure of any such condition to be capable of
satisfaction is not the result of a material breach of this Agreement by the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement;

(c) by Aztar, if Pinnacle shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A)
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.02(a) or
(b), and (B) is incapable of being cured by Pinnacle or is not cured by
Pinnacle within 120 days following receipt of written notice from Aztar of
such breach or failure to perform;

Termination Expenses, of Section 5.07;

 

(e) by Pinnacle, if Aztar shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A)
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.03(a) or
(b), and (B) is incapable of being cured by Aztar or is not cured by Aztar
within 120 days following receipt of written notice from Pinnacle of such
breach or failure to perform;

stockholders of Aztar in connection with the commencement of a tender offer or
exchange offer limited to the "stop-look-and-listen" matters specified in
Rule 14d-9(f), shall not be deemed to constitute an approval or recommendation
of a Takeover Proposal); and

(g) by Pinnacle, in the event of a material breach of Section 4.03 or Section
5.01(b).

Section 7.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Pinnacle or Aztar as provided in Section 7.01, this
Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Aztar or Pinnacle, other than the fee

48  extent that such termination results from the willful and material breach by
a party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement, in which case such termination shall not relieve
any party of any liability or damages resulting from its willful and material
breach of this Agreement or in the case of Pinnacle, if all of the conditions
to Pinnacles obligation to consummate the Merger are satisfied (other than
the condition set forth in Section 6.03(c)) (and, in the case of the condition
set forth in Section 6.03(c), either such condition has been satisfied or
Aztar confirms to Pinnacle in writing that it is willing and able to deliver
the certificate referred to in Section 6.03(c) as of the Closing Date) and
Pinnacle fails to consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms and
conditions hereof as a result of its failure to obtain the Financing.

Section 7.03 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after the Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after any such approval, there shall not be made any amendment that by law
requires further approval by the stockholders of Aztar without the further
approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

Section 7.04 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, a

with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

Section 8.04 _Interpretation and Other Matters_. (a) When a reference is made
in this Agreement to an Article, Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be
to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used
in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to
the masculine as well as to the feminine genders of such term. Any agreement,
instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or
instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or
statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in
the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case
of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and references
to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References
to a person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. "Knowledge" of a
person and similar terms shall mean the actual knowledge of the executive
officers of such person.

(b) Each of Aztar and Pinnacle has or may have set forth information in its
respective disclosure letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the
section of this Agreement  



 

54  to which it relates. A matter set forth in one section of a disclosure
letter need not be set forth in any other section of the disclosure letter so
long as its relevance to the latter section of the disclosure letter or
section of the Agreement is readily apparent on the face of the information
disclosed in the disclosure letter to the person to which such disclosure is
being made. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in a
disclosure letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such
information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Such information
and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a basis for
interpreting the terms "material," "material adverse effect" or other similar
terms in this Agreement.

(c) Pinnacle agrees to cause Merger Sub to comply with its respective
obligations under this Agreement.

Section 8.05  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
party and delivered to the other parties.

Section 8.06 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the documents and instruments referred to herein) and the
Confidentiality Agreement (i) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and (ii) except
for the provisions of Section 5.06 (which shall be enforceable by the
Indemnified Parties), are not intended to and shall not confer upon any person
other than the parties any rights or remedies.

Section 8.07 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless
of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflict of laws.

Section 8.08 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other party. Any attempted or purported
assignment in violation of the preceding sentence shall be null and void and
of no effect whatsoever. Subject to the preceding two sentences, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 8.09 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It
is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any federal or state court
located in the State of Delaware, this  



 

55  being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts
located in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (c) agrees that
it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than a federal
or state court in the State of Delaware.

Section 8.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the extent possible.

Section 8.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 8.12 _Alternative Structure_. The parties agree to cooperate in the
consideration of alternative structures to implement the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as long as there is no change in the economic
terms thereof and such change does not impose any material delay on, or
condition to, the consummation of the Merger, or adversely affect Aztar,
prior to the Effective Time, or Aztars stockholders or result in liability to
Aztars directors or officers. Any such alternative structure shall constitute
a "change of control" with respect to the Aztar Employee Benefit Plans and
Aztar Employment Agreements to the same extent that the transactions
contemplated hereby constitute a "change of control" with respect to the
applicable Plan or Agreement. 



 

56 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Pinnacle, Aztar and Merger Sub have caused this Agreement
to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized, all as
of the date first written above.
