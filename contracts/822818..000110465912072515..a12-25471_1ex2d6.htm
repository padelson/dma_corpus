shares of capital stock of the Constituent Corporations:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Subject to the provisions of this _Article

prior to the Effective Time (including any shares subject to transfer or other
restrictions, but excluding shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled
pursuant to _Section 4.1(c)_ and any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive, pursuant to _Section 4.2_, an amount in cash

Indemnification Escrow Amount, _plus_ (z) the Adjustment Escrow Amount,
divided by (ii) the Fully Diluted Common Number (such result, the " _Per Share

(b) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. Subject to the other provisions of
this _Article IV_ , all shares of Company Common Stock shall, upon conversion
thereof into the right to receive the Per Share Initial Merger Consideration
at the Effective Time, cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be

Common Stock. The holders of certificates previously evidencing any such
shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common
Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by Law.

 



 

(c) _Treasury Stock_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the
Company and each share of Company Common Stock, if any, owned by Acquiror or
any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror or of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and cease to exist
and shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Initial
Merger Consideration.

 



 

(d) _Merger Sub Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(e) _Anti-Dilution_. If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split, division, combination or
exchange of shares, there will be a proportionate adjustment made to the Per
Share Initial Merger Consideration, the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the
Indemnification Escrow Amount to reflect such change.

 



 

 _Section 4.2_ _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association
(the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this _Article IV_ through the
Paying Agent, cash in an aggregate amount sufficient to pay all of the Per
Share Initial Merger

 



      
 

 



 

Consideration to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance
with this _Article IV_ (such total amount of the Per Share Initial Merger
Consideration being referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). If a holder of
Dissenting Shares fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his right to
appraisal after the Effective Time, (A) such shares of Company Common Stock
shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and (B) Acquiror shall deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with the Paying Agent additional funds in an amount equal to
the product of (x) the number of Dissenting Shares for which such holder has
failed to perfect, withdraw or loses the right to appraisal and (y) the Per
Share Initial Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. The Paying
Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions from Acquiror, deliver the
Per Share Initial Merger Consideration in exchange for certificates
theretofore evidencing Company Common Stock surrendered to the Paying Agent
pursuant to _Section 4.2(c)_.

 



 

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each record holder of a certificate or
certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Certificates_ ") whose shares are converted
pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_ into the right to receive the Per Share Initial
Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal for delivery of such
Certificates to the Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of such Certificates for the Per Share Initial Merger
Consideration.

 



 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Acquiror shall cause the Paying Agent to distribute
to each former holder of shares of Company Common Stock, upon surrender to the
Paying Agent for cancellation of one or more Certificates, accompanied by a
letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the Per Share Initial Merger Consideration in the form
of a wire transfer of same-day funds in the amount such former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock is entitled to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article IV_. If the Per Share Initial Merger Consideration
is to be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or Certificates are registered, it will be a condition to receive
the Per Share Initial Merger Consideration that the surrendered Certificate or
Certificates shall be properly endorsed.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains unclaimed by the former holders of shares of Company Common Stock at
the second anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former holders of shares of
Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this _Article IV_
shall, subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and other similar
Laws, thereafter look only to Surviving Corporation for any Merger
Consideration to which they are entitled.

 



 

(e) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger
or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares
of Company Common Stock in accordance with the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not

 



       
 

 



 

be converted into a right to receive the Per Share Initial Merger
Consideration as set forth herein, but such holder shall be entitled to
receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to the DGCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails
to perfect or withdraws or loses his right to appraisal, such shares of
Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they had converted as of the
Effective Time into a right to receive the Per Share Initial Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, such shares shall no longer be
Dissenting Shares and shall be paid as contemplated by _Section 4.2(a)_ and
such shares shall be deemed to have been issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(f) _Withholding of Tax_. Acquiror or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any former holder of Company Options and shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code, applicable Treasury Regulations
promulgated under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Acquiror or
the Paying Agent and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the former holder of Company Options and shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of whom such deduction, withholding and payment was made by Acquiror
or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

 



 

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact (such affidavit shall
be in form reasonably satisfactory to the Paying Agent) by the person claiming
such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by the
Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in customary amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, Per Share Initial Merger Consideration to which the
holder may be entitled pursuant to this _Article IV_.

 



 

(h) _Escrow_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, (i) an amount of cash equal to the Indemnification
Escrow Amount into an account maintained by the Escrow Agent (the "
_Indemnification Escrow Account_ ") and (ii) an amount of cash equal to the
Adjustment Escrow Amount into an account maintained by the Escrow Agent (the "
_Adjustment Escrow Account_ "). The Escrow Agent shall maintain the
Indemnification Escrow Account and Adjustment Escrow Account separately and
shall not commingle funds in such accounts. If a holder of Dissenting Shares
fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his right to appraisal after the
Effective Time, Acquiror shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, (A) into the
Indemnification Escrow Account additional funds in an amount equal to the
product of (x) the number of Dissenting Shares for which such holder has
failed to perfect, withdraw or loses the right to appraisal and (y) the Per
Share Indemnification Escrow Amount and (B) into the Adjustment Escrow Account
additional funds in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of
Dissenting Shares for which such holder has failed to perfect, withdraw or
loses the right to appraisal and (y) the Per Share Adjustment Escrow Amount.

 



      
 

 



 

Distributions from the Indemnification Escrow Account and Adjustment Escrow
Account shall be governed by the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement.

 



 

 _Section 4.3_ _Options_.

 



 

At the Effective Time, each unexercised, unexpired and outstanding option to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock, whether or not then vested or
exercisable (each, a " _Company Option_ "), that has an exercise price less
than the Gross Per Share Merger Consideration, shall be cancelled and in
consideration therefor, each holder of such Company Option shall receive from
Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation, on the Closing Date, an amount in cash
equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Initial
Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Company Option
and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option, without interest and net of any applicable withholding Taxes pursuant
to _Section 4.2(f)_ (such amount, the " _Company Option Consideration_ "). In

shall take all action necessary to accelerate the vesting, effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time, for each holder of Company Options,
of one hundred percent (100%) of all such holders unvested Company Options
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the
avoidance of doubt, each holder of a Company Option with a per share exercise
price that is equal to or greater than the Gross Per Share Merger

Plan and whether or not subject to a deferral agreement (each, a " _Company
Restricted Stock Unit_ ") that is unexpired and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, whether or not such share is vested or subject to
restrictions, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and in consideration therefor, each
holder of such Company Restricted Stock Unit shall receive from Acquiror or
the Surviving Corporation, on the Closing Date, an amount in cash equal to the
product of (i) the Per Share Initial Merger Consideration and (ii) the number
of units subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit, without interest and
net of any applicable withholding Taxes pursuant to _Section 4.2(f)_ (such
amount, the " _Company Restricted Stock Unit Consideration_ "). No shares of
Company Common Stock shall be issued as a result of the Merger in respect of
any Company Restricted Stock Unit, whether or not subject to a deferral
agreement. The Company and the Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation shall

Chief Financial Officer of the Company that sets forth in reasonable detail
the Companys estimates of the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, Fully
Diluted Common Number, Aggregate Exercise Price, Closing Debt and Closing Cash
(" _Estimated Closing Cash_ "), which calculations shall not (except with
respect to the Fully Diluted Common Number and Aggregate Exercise Price)
reflect or give effect to the transactions occurring at Closing, along with
reasonable supporting detail therefor, such estimates to be prepared in
accordance with GAAP and the past practices of the Company, using the
policies, conventions, methodologies and procedures used by the Company in
preparing the Financial Statements.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 120 days following
the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall, at its expense, (i) cause
to be prepared, in accordance with GAAP, using the policies, conventions,
methodologies and procedures used by the Company in preparing the Financial
Statements, an unaudited balance sheet of the Company on or prior to the close
of business on the Closing Date, but which shall not reflect or give effect to
the transactions occurring at the Closing (the " _Closing Balance Shee_ t"),
together with a statement (the " _Closing Date Schedule_ ") setting forth in
reasonable detail the Surviving Corporations calculations of the Closing Net
Working Capital Amount and Closing Cash, which calculations shall not reflect
or give effect to the transactions occurring at the Closing, and (ii) deliver
to the Shareholder Representative the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Date Schedule.

 



 

(c) _Review; Disputes_.

 



 

(i) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide
the Shareholder Representative and any accountants or advisors retained by the
Shareholder Representative with reasonable access, during normal business
hours, to the relevant books and records of the Surviving Corporation used by
the Surviving Corporation in the preparation of, or otherwise reasonably
relevant to, the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Schedule for the
purposes of: (A) enabling the Shareholder Representative and its accountants
and advisors to calculate, and to review the Surviving Corporations

 



      
 

 



 

calculations of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount and Closing Cash and
(B) identifying any dispute related to the calculations of the Closing Net
Working Capital Amount and Closing Cash in the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Date Schedule.

 



 

(ii) If the Shareholder Representative disputes the calculation of the Closing
Net Working Capital Amount and/or Closing Cash set forth in the Closing
Balance Sheet or the Closing Date Schedule, then the Shareholder
Representative shall deliver a written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to the
Surviving Corporation and the Escrow Agent at any time during the 60-day
period commencing upon receipt by the Shareholder Representative of the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Schedule, all as prepared by the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with the requirements of _Section 4.6(a)_
(the " _Review Period_ "). The Dispute Notice shall set forth the Shareholder
Representatives calculation of each disputed amount in reasonable detail (the
item or items to which the Shareholder Representative objects being referred
to herein as the " _Contested Adjustments_ ") .

 



 

(iii) If the Shareholder Representative does not deliver a Dispute Notice to
the Surviving Corporation prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the
Surviving Corporations calculations of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount
and Closing Cash set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Date
Schedule shall be deemed final and binding on Acquiror, the Surviving
Corporation, the Shareholder Representative and the Company Equityholders for
all purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(iv) If the Shareholder Representative delivers a Dispute Notice to the
Surviving Corporation prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then the
Shareholder Representative and the Surviving Corporation shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the Contested
Adjustments, and all such discussions thereto shall, unless otherwise agreed
by the Shareholder Representative and the Surviving Corporation, be governed
by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state
rule. If the Shareholder Representative and the Surviving Corporation are
unable to reach agreement on the Contested Adjustments within 30 days after
the delivery of the Dispute Notice, either party shall have the right to refer
any such remaining Contested Adjustments to PricewaterhouseCoopers or an
alternative national accounting firm reasonably agreed to by the Shareholder
Representative and Acquiror (such firm, or any successor thereto, being
referred to herein as the " _Accounting Firm_ ") after such 30th day. The
Accounting Firm shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based solely on the
materials submitted and presentations by the Shareholder Representative and
the Surviving Corporation, and not by independent review, only the Contested
Adjustments that have not been settled by

 



      
 

 



 

negotiation and shall be instructed to render its decision within 30 days of
its referral. In making its determination, the Accounting firm will use the
policies, conventions, methodologies and procedures required by _Section
4.6(a)_. The decision of the Accounting Firm as to the Contested Adjustments
shall be final and binding on, and shall not be subject to appeal by, the
Shareholder Representative or the Surviving Corporation, and may be entered
and enforced by any court having jurisdiction. The Closing Date Schedule shall
be revised as necessary to reflect the decision of the Accounting Firm and the
other modifications made thereto previously agreed to by the Shareholder
Representative and the Surviving Corporation. Each of the Shareholder
Representative and the Surviving Corporation shall bear its own expenses
incurred in connection with the resolution of the Closing Date Schedule, and
the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by the
Shareholder Representative, on the one hand, and the Surviving Corporation, on
the other hand.

 



 

(d) _Payment Upon Final Determination of Adjustments_.

 



 

(i) If (1) the sum of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount and Closing Cash,
as finally determined in accordance with _Section 4.6(c)_, is greater than
(2) the sum of the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount and Estimated Closing
Cash, then (A) the Surviving Corporation shall, no later than five (5)
Business Days after such determination, cause to be paid to the Paying Agent,
for the benefit of each Company Equityholder as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (or, if such Company Equityholder is a holder of Company Common
Stock and has not exchanged such shares pursuant to _Section 4.2_, then upon
such exchange by such Company Equityholder) by delivery of immediately
available funds to such Company Equityholder an amount equal to the product of
(x) the amount of such excess multiplied by (y) such Company Equityholders
Applicable Percentage and (B) the Escrow Agent shall cause to be paid to each
Company Equityholder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (or, if
such Company Equityholder is a holder of Company Common Stock and has not
exchanged such shares pursuant to _Section 4.2_, then upon exchange by such
Company Equityholder) by delivery of immediately available funds to such
Company Equityholder an amount equal to the product of the Adjustment Escrow
Amount multiplied by such Company Equityholders Applicable Percentage.

 



 

(ii) If (1) the sum of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount and Closing
Cash, as finally determined in accordance with this _Section 4.6(c)_, is less
than (2) the sum of the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount and Estimated
Closing Cash, then the Escrow Agent shall cause to be paid to the Surviving
Corporation by delivery of immediately available funds the amount (not to
exceed the Adjustment Escrow Amount) equal to the amount of such deficiency
solely from the

 



      
 

 



 

Adjustment Escrow Account. If the Escrow Agent makes a payment pursuant to
this _Section 4.6(d)(ii)_ to the Surviving Corporation and after such payment
funds remain in the Adjustment Escrow Account, then the Escrow Agent shall
cause to be paid to each Company Equityholder as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (or, if such Company Equityholder is a holder of Company Common
Stock and has not exchanged such shares pursuant to _Section 4.2_, then upon
such exchange by such Company Equityholder) by delivery of immediately
available funds to such holder an amount equal to the product of the funds
remaining in the Adjustment Escrow Account multiplied by such Company
Equityholders Applicable Percentage.

 



 

(e) _Payment Procedures_. Any payment to be made pursuant to _Section 4.6(d)_
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds, together with
interest thereon for the period commencing on the Closing Date through the
date on which such payment is made, calculated at the Prime Rate. Such
interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates
and shall be calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the
actual number of days elapsed.

Company, no condition exists that would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect such qualifications.

 



 

(g) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.14(g)_ , the consummation of the

accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or materially increase the amount
of compensation due any such employee or officer.

Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.16_ , to the knowledge of the Company:

describes any self-insurance arrangements affecting the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries.

 



 

ARTICLE VI

 



 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ACQUIROR AND MERGER SUB

 



 

The Acquiror Companies, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:

 



 

 _Section 6.1_ _Organization_.

 



 

Each of the Acquiror Companies is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties

 



      
 

 



 

and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the
failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing or to have such
power and authority would not be reasonably be expected to have an Acquiror
Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, " _Acquiror Material
Adverse Effect_ " means an effect that would reasonably be expected to hinder,
impair or delay the ability of the Acquiror Companies to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 _Section 6.2_ _Authorization; Validity of Agreement_.

 



 

Each of the Acquiror Companies has full corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform all of its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution, delivery and performance by each of the Acquiror Companies of this
Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, have
been duly authorized by the boards of directors of each of the Acquiror
Companies and the stockholders of Merger Sub and no other corporate action on
the part of either of the Acquiror Companies is necessary to authorize the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation by either of the
Acquiror Companies of the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Acquiror Companies and, assuming due
and valid authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Company, is a
valid and binding obligation of each of the Acquiror Companies, enforceable
against each of them in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such
enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect,
affecting creditors rights generally and (ii) the remedy of specific
performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject
to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding therefor may be brought.

 



 

 _Section 6.3_ _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_.

 



 

Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by the
Acquiror Companies nor the consummation by the Acquiror Companies of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (a) violate any provision of the
articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Acquiror Companies; (b) result in
a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse
of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration) or result in the creation of any Lien upon any
of the assets or properties of the Acquiror Companies, under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease,
license, contract, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which an
Acquiror Company is a party or by which any of them or any of their properties
or assets may be bound; or (c) violate any Law applicable to the Acquiror
Companies; except in the case of clauses (b) and (c) for such violations,
breaches or defaults that, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect. No filing
or registration with, notification to, or authorization, consent or approval
of, any Governmental Entity or third party is required by or with respect to
the Acquiror Companies in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or is necessary for the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated

 



      
 

 



 

by this Agreement, except for (i) filings pursuant to the HSR Act and the
Competition Act, (ii) applicable filings under merger control and competition
Laws, (iii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware and appropriate documents with the relevant
authorities of other states in which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
qualified to do business, and (iv) such other consents, orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings the failure of any of
which to be obtained or made would not be reasonably be expected to have a
Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 _Section 6.4_ _No Default; Compliance with Applicable Laws_.

 



 

Neither of the Acquiror Companies is in default or violation of any term,
condition or provision of (i) their respective articles of incorporation, by-
laws or similar organizational documents or (ii) to the knowledge of Acquiror,
any Law applicable to Acquiror or any of its subsidiaries, excluding from the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), defaults or violations that, individually or
in the aggregate would not be reasonably be expected to have an Acquiror
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 _Section 6.5_ _Information Statement_.

 



 

Any information to be supplied by Acquiror or Merger Sub for inclusion in the
Information Statement shall not, on the date the Information Statement is
first mailed to the Companys stockholders and, if applicable, at the time of
the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements contained therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquiror and Merger Sub make no representation
or warranty with respect to any information supplied by the Company that is
contained in the Information Statement.

 



 

 _Section 6.6_ _Financing_.

 



 

The financing required to consummate the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby and to pay related fees and expenses is collectively
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Financing_ ". Acquiror has delivered
to the Company a true and complete copy of a fully-executed commitment letter
(the " _Commitment Letter_ ") made by Goldman Sachs Bank USA (including any
parties thereto that join by joinder and together with their affiliates,
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives and their
respective successors and assigns, the " _Lender_ ") relating to the
Financing. At the Effective Time, assuming that the Lender shall have funded
under the Commitment Letter pursuant to the terms thereof, Acquiror and Merger
Sub will have available all of the funds necessary for the acquisition of all
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, and to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement. Except as set forth in the
Commitment Letter, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the
Lender to fund the portion of the Financing specified in the Commitment
Letter. There are no other agreements, side letters, or arrangements that
would permit the Lender to reduce the amount of the portion of the Financing
specified in

 



      
 

 



 

the Commitment Letter or that could otherwise affect the availability of the
portion of the Financing specified in the Commitment Letter. The Commitment
Letter has been duly executed and delivered by, and is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of, Acquiror and, to the knowledge of Acquiror, the Lender.
The fee letter associated with the Commitment Letter does not contain any
conditions precedent to the funding of the Financing. As of the date hereof,
the Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn
or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect. All commitment
and other fees required to be paid under the Commitment Letter on or prior to
the date hereof have been paid and, as of the date hereof, to the knowledge of
Acquiror, there is no fact or occurrence existing that would make any of the
statements (including assumptions) set forth in the Commitment Letter
inaccurate in any material respect. Assuming no breach or default by the
Company under this Agreement, there is no fact or occurrence known to Acquiror
or Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement that would cause the conditions
to funding of the portion of the Financing specified in the Commitment Letter
not to be satisfied at or before the Effective Time, and, subject to such
assumption, neither Acquiror nor Merger Sub has reason to believe as of the
date hereof that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or
condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained in the Commitment Letter.

 



 

 _Section 6.7_ _Certain Tax Benefits_.

 



 

Acquiror acknowledges that the Company will receive certain Tax benefits
arising out of (i) the payments to holders of Company Options pursuant to
_Section 4.3_, (ii) the payment to holders of Restricted Stock Units pursuant
to _Section 4.4_ and (iii) the realization of deferred financing costs.

 



 

 _Section 6.8_ _Brokers or Finders_.

 



 

No agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or person
is or will be entitled to any brokers or finders fee or any other commission
or similar fee in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

be taken, all actions, and to do, or to cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing all things necessary, proper or

Agreement; (ii) obtain from any governmental authorities any actions, non-
actions, clearances, waivers, consents, approvals, permits or orders required

contemplated hereby, including the Merger; (iii) promptly (and in the case of
the HSR Act and the Competition Act, no later than twelve (12) Business Days

filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to
this Agreement and the Merger required under (A) the HSR Act, the Competition
Act and any other applicable merger control or competition Laws and (B) any

will cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all such
filings, including providing copies of all such filings and attachments to
outside counsel for the non-filing party; (iv) furnish all information
required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any
applicable Law or any applicable regulations of any Governmental Entity in

attend and participate in such meetings and conferences (to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity or private party); (vii) avoid the entry

restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, including defending any lawsuits or
other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this

(viii) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No parties to this Agreement

limiting, and in furtherance of, this _Section 8.4(a)_ ,

 



      
 

 



 

Acquiror agrees to take any and all commercially reasonable steps and to make
any and all commercially reasonable undertakings necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, merger control,
competition, or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon
as reasonably possible (and in any event, no later than the Termination Date),
_provided that_ , in no event shall Acquiror be required to take any action
that would require (A) the sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of any
assets or businesses that are material to Acquiror and its subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or (ii) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (B) that would otherwise limit in any material respects Acquirors
or its subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to
retain, any of the businesses, product lines or assets that are material to
Acquiror and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(b) _Third Party Notices and Consents_. Each of the Company and Acquiror shall
give (or will cause their respective subsidiaries to give) any notices to
third persons, and use, and cause their respective subsidiaries to use, their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents from third persons
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 _Section 8.5_ _Public Announcements_.

 



 

Acquiror and the Company shall consult with each other and will mutually agree
upon any press release or public announcement pertaining to the Merger and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public announcement
prior to such consultation and agreement, except as may be required by
applicable Law or the rules of any stock exchange.

 



 

 _Section 8.6_ _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Affected Employees_. Acquiror agrees that each individual who was
employed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time will continue, subject to Law, as an at-will (unless otherwise
provided under any written agreement in effect prior to the Closing) employee
of the Surviving Corporation or one of its subsidiaries following the
Effective Time (each such employee, an " _Affected Employee_ "), and
compensated substantially at such rate of compensation as was in effect with
respect to such Affected Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) _Incentive Plans_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
following the Effective Time, Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation) to, maintain the Companys management
incentive plans, sales incentive plans and retail sales incentive plans, in
accordance with their respective terms as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time until such time as bonuses in respect of fiscal year 2012 have
been paid; provided, however, that pro-rata incentive award payments under the
2012 Annual Incentive Plan shall be paid in accordance with the terms of such
plan, based on year-to-date achievement of applicable performance

 



      
 

 



 

goals payable on the Effective Date (for the avoidance of doubt, the amount to
be paid has been accrued as a liability by the Company and shall not reduce
Gross Per Share Merger Consideration).

 



 

(c) _Certain Termination Payments_. During the twelve (12) month period
commencing at the Effective Time, Acquiror shall provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, to Affected Employees who experience an
involuntary termination of employment, severance compensation and benefits
that are no less than the severance compensation and benefits that would have
been provided under a Company Benefit Plan to such Company employees upon such
a termination of employment immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) _Eligibility for Benefits_. Acquiror shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, give the Affected Employees full credit for all purposes
(including eligibility to participate, vesting and level of benefits) under
any employee benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements maintained by
Acquiror and its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries) (" _Acquiror Plans_ ") in which Affected Employees or such
former employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary participate for such
persons service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary (or any other
employer to the extent credited by the Company) to the same extent recognized
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except to the extent that giving such service credit results in the
duplication of benefits.

 



 

(e) _Medical and Welfare Plan Obligations_. Acquiror shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods and service requirements with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Affected
Employees or applicable former employees of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary under any Acquiror Plan, other than limitations, waiting periods or
service requirements that are already in effect with respect to such persons
and that have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any Company
Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide each
Affected Employee or applicable former employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any analogous Acquiror Plan for the plan year that includes
the Effective Time.

 



 

(f) This _Section 8.6_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of the respective parties hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person (including any
employees, former employees, any participant or any beneficiary thereof in any
Company Benefit Plan or Acquiror Plan) any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 8.6_.

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 8.7_ _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Acquiror and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that their obligations hereunder
are not conditioned in any matter upon Acquiror or Merger Sub obtaining any
financing.

 



 

(b) Subject to the provisions of _Section 8.7(d)_ , Acquiror shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to consummate and obtain the financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter (the " _Acquisition
Financing_ "), including using commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto in a
timely manner and on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the
Commitment Letter, which definitive agreements will not expand upon the
conditions to the receipt of the Acquisition Financing as set forth in the
Commitment Letter or amend or modify the terms of the Commitment Letter in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to impair the ability of Acquiror to
consummate the Acquisition Financing, and (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Acquiror and Merger Sub contained in such definitive
agreements. Acquiror shall refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any
actions that could reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions
contained in the Commitment Letter or in any definitive agreement related to
the Acquisition Financing, in each case, that are within the control of
Acquiror not being satisfied. Acquiror shall (x) furnish to the Company
complete, correct and executed copies of the definitive agreements related to
the Acquisition Financing promptly upon their execution, (y) give the Company
prompt notice of any material breach by any party of any of the Commitment
Letter or the definitive agreements related to the Acquisition Financing of
which Acquiror becomes aware or any termination thereof and (z) otherwise keep

hereunder, and provided, further, that such reduction shall not (A) expand
upon the conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding on the Closing
Date of the Acquisition Financing as set forth in the Commitment Letter, (B)
contain terms that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder beyond the timing
contemplated by the prior Commitment Letter or (C) adversely impact the
ability of Acquiror to enforce its rights against the Lender under the

supplement or modify the Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements with
respect to the Acquisition Financing provided for in the Commitment Letter and
shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the terms thereof.

 



 

(e) Acquiror agrees to notify the Company promptly (and in any event not later
than 48 hours after such occurrence), if at any time prior to the Closing: (i)
the Commitment Letter shall expire or be terminated for any reason; (ii)
Acquiror reasonably determines that it shall be unable to satisfy, on a timely
basis, any term or condition of the Acquisition Financing to be satisfied by
it, that in each case would reasonably be expected to impair the ability of
Acquiror to consummate the Acquisition

either no longer intends to provide or underwrite the Acquisition Financing on
the terms set forth in the Commitment Letter.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing in this _Section 8.7_ shall require, and the commercially reasonable

materially in excess of those contemplated by the Commitment Letter (whether
to secure a waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise).

Letter to be satisfied and as otherwise may be necessary or desirable in
connection with the arrangement and consummation of the Acquisition Financing

of the Company and its subsidiaries to timely deliver their consent to
Acquirors inclusion of such accountants report on the Companys audited
financial statements and notes and schedules thereto included in any
registration statement or offering memorandum for any such financing, and in
connection therewith furnish such accountants such information and
representation letters as are customarily required in connection with the
issuance of such auditors consent;

to this _Section 8.7_ in order to ensure that such Required Information is
Compliant.

 



 

(h) Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that, prior to the Effective Time, the
Company, its subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall not have
any responsibility for, or incur any liability to any Person under, any
financing that Acquiror may raise or seek to raise in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any cooperation provided
pursuant to this _Section 8.7_ and that Acquiror shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or
expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the
arrangement of any financing Acquiror elects to seek and any information
utilized in connection

 



      
 

 



 

therewith except to the extent such losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses
proximately result from the Required Information provided in writing for such
use by or on behalf of the Company or any of its affiliates.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of the

Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries upon termination of this Agreement,
(D) take any action that could reasonably be expected to (1) unreasonably

be satisfied, (3) cause any director, officer or employee of the Company or

result in the disclosure of the Companys financial position or results of
operations prior to the date such information has been released by the Company

(j) Following a written request from the Company, Acquiror shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce (including by litigation) its
rights under (i) the Commitment Letter and (ii) any commitment letter for any
Alternative Financing (an "Alternative Financing Commitment Letter"), to
cause, respectively, the Lender and any lender with respect to any Alternative
Financing, to, subject to the terms and conditions of, respectively, the

satisfaction or waiver of the conditions in Article IX hereof, fund the
Acquisition Financing and any Alternative Financing at the Closing.

 



 

 _Section 8.8_ _Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Directors and
Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) _Indemnification_. From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any outstanding and existing
indemnification agreements listed in _Schedule 8.8(a)_ , the Certificate of
Incorporation or

 



      
 

 



 

By-laws, the individuals who at or prior to the Effective Time were officers,
directors, employees and agents of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all acts or omissions by
them in their capacities as such or taken at the request of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries at any time at or prior to the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor and not amend, repeal or otherwise modify in a
manner that would adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee all rights to
indemnification or exculpation existing in favor of an Indemnitee (including
rights relating to the advancement of expenses and indemnification rights to
which such persons are entitled because of service as a director, officer,
agent or employee of another entity at the request of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries) as provided under the applicable provision of the
DGCL, the certificate of incorporation of the Company, the by-laws of the
Company, or any indemnification agreement listed in _Schedule 8.8(a)_ , in
each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Liability Insurance_. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time, Acquiror shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in
effect directors and officers liability insurance covering those persons
who, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, are covered by the
Companys and the Company Subsidiaries directors and officers liability
insurance policies (the " _Insured Parties_ ") on terms no less favorable to
the Insured Parties than those of the present directors and officers
liability insurance policies, _provided however_ , that in no event shall
Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation be obligated under this _Section 8.8(b)_
to purchase any insurance to the extent that the cost thereof would exceed
$400,000, _provided further_ , that in lieu of the purchase of such insurance
by Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation, Acquiror may at its option prior to
the Effective Time purchase a six-year run-off program for directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance providing at
least the same coverage with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(c) _Enforcement_. The obligations of Acquiror under this _Section 8.8_ shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnitee to whom this _Section 8.8_ applies without the consent of the
affected Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed and understood that the
Indemnitees and Insured Parties to whom this _Section 8.8_ applies shall be
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 8.8_ and the provisions of this
_Section 8.8_ shall be enforceable by each Indemnitee and/or Insured Party and
the heirs and representatives of such persons and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Acquiror, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation). In the event Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
person or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys a majority of its
properties and assets to any person or entity then, and in each case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors, assigns and transferees of
Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 8.8_. Acquiror hereby guarantees the
performance by the Surviving Corporation of the indemnification and other
obligations pursuant to this

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 8.8_ and the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation.

filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications, or other documents
regarding (i) any property transfer gains, sales, use, transfer, value-added,
stock transfer and stamp taxes, (ii) any recording, registration and other
fees, and (iii) any similar Taxes or fees (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ")
that become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
Acquiror shall pay all Transfer Taxes that become payable in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

 _Section 8.10_ _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 8.10(b)_ , from the date hereof until the Effective
Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article VIII_ , the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its
subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Representatives
to, directly or indirectly through another Person: (i) solicit, initiate, or
knowingly encourage the submission, announcement or making of any Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry by any Person, or take any action that could
reasonably be expected to lead a Person to disclose, announce, commence,
submit or otherwise make an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; (ii)
furnish or otherwise provide access to any information, except information
relating to the existence of these provisions, regarding any of the Company or
its subsidiaries to any Person in connection with or in response to an
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; or (iii) engage in discussions
(except as to the existence of these provisions) or negotiations with any
Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry.
Subject to _Section 8.10(b)_ , from the date hereof the Company shall cease
and cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or
negotiation with any Persons conducted theretofore by the Company, its
subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 8.10(a)_ ,
if at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting the Company receives
an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry which the board of directors of
the Company determines constitutes or could reasonably be likely to result in
a Superior Proposal, the Company may, in response to such Acquisition Proposal
or Acquisition Inquiry (provided such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry did not result from a breach by the Company of any provision herein),
(A) furnish information with respect to it and its subsidiaries to any Person
making such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement (as determined after consultation with the
Companys legal counsel), the benefits of the terms of which, if more
favorable to the other party to such confidentiality agreement than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), shall be extended to Acquiror, and (B) participate in
discussions and negotiations regarding such

 



       
 

 



 

Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry. From and after the date hereof,
if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, it
shall promptly advise Acquiror in writing of such Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry and the material terms and conditions thereof. The Company
shall promptly provide Acquiror with copies of all proposed definitive
documents received by the Company or any of its Representatives from any such
Person or its Representatives relating to any Acquisition Proposal and shall
keep Acquiror reasonably informed with respect to the status of any such
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and any modification or proposed
modification thereto, and shall promptly notify Acquiror of any material
change or development with respect to such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry. In connection with furnishing or otherwise permitting the transmittal
of any material non-public information to any Person pursuant to this _Section
8.10(b)_ , the Company shall (as a condition to furnishing or otherwise
permitting the transmittal of such information to such Person) promptly
furnish such information to Acquiror (to the extent such information has not
been previously furnished or made available by the Company to Acquiror).

 



 

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 8.10(c)_ , the board of
directors of the Company shall not (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly
to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Acquiror, the approval or
recommendation by such board of directors of this Agreement or the approval of
this Agreement by the stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting (a "
_Change of Recommendation_ "), (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly
to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) cause or permit
the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement or understanding (an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ ") related to any Acquisition Proposal other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into pursuant to _Section
8.10(b)_. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, prior to the
adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders at the Company
Stockholders Meeting, (x) in response to the receipt of a written Acquisition
Proposal in connection with which the Company has not breached _Section
8.10(a)_ in a manner that resulted in the submission of an Acquisition
Proposal (and subject to _Section 8.10(b)_ , if the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal and, after consultation with its legal counsel, determines that its
failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable
Law, then the board of directors of the Company may approve or recommend such
Superior Proposal and, in connection with the approval or recommendation of
such Superior Proposal, make a Change of Recommendation and/or terminate this
Agreement (and subject to _Article X_ , in connection with such termination,
if it so chooses, cause the Company to enter into an Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal).

 



 

(d) Nothing in this _Section 8.10_ shall prohibit the board of directors of
the Company from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or other applicable Law, if
the board of directors of the Company determines, after consultation with
legal counsel, that failure to so

 



      
 

 



 

disclose such position could constitute a violation of applicable Law, and any
such disclosure which would otherwise constitute a withdrawal, change or
modification of the approval or recommendation of the board of directors of
the Company, shall not be deemed to constitute such a withdrawal, change or
modification with respect to the Merger for the purposes of _Section 8.10(c)_
if the board of directors of the Company expressly publicly reaffirms its
approval and recommendation of this Agreement within five (5) Business Days
after a request by Acquiror to do so. In addition, it is understood and agreed
that, for purposes of this _Section 8.10_ , a factually accurate public
statement by the Company that describes the Companys receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto
and contains a "stop-look-and-listen" communication shall not constitute a
withdrawal, change or modification of the approval or recommendation of the
board of directors of the Company with respect to the Merger for the purposes
of _Section 8.10(c)_.

 



 

 _Section 8.11_ _No Implied Representations or Warranties; Due Diligence_.

 



 

(a) _No Implied Representations and Warranties_. Acquiror and Merger Sub
hereby acknowledge and agree that neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is making any representation or warranty whatsoever, express or
implied, except those representations and warranties of the Company explicitly
set forth in this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
and notwithstanding any otherwise express representations and warranties made
by the Company in _Article V_ hereof, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary makes any representation or warranty to Acquiror or Merger Sub with
respect to: (i) any projections, estimates or budgets heretofore delivered to
or made available to Acquiror or Merger Sub of future revenues, expenses or
expenditures or future results of operations; or (ii) except as expressly
covered by a representation or warranty contained in _Article V_ hereof, any
other information or documents (financial or otherwise) made available to
Acquiror or Merger Sub or their counsel, accountants or advisers with respect
to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) _Due Diligence_. The Acquiror Companies acknowledge that: (i) they have
had the opportunity to visit with the Company and meet with its officers and
other representatives to discuss the business and the assets, liabilities,
financial condition, cash flows and operations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries; and (ii) all materials and information requested by Acquiror or
Merger Sub to date have been provided to Acquirors and Merger Subs
reasonable satisfaction. Notwithstanding the forgoing or anything to the
contrary provided herein, the representations, warranties and covenants of the
Company, and the Acquiror Companies right to indemnification with respect
thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation
made by or on behalf of any Acquiror Company (including by any of its
Representatives) or by reason of the fact that any Acquiror Company or any of
its Representatives knew or should have known that any such representation or
warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by reason of the Acquiror
Companies waiver of any condition set forth in _Article IX_.

not be available to the Company if it has failed to perform in any material
respect any of its obligations under or in connection with this Agreement; or

 



 

(g) by Acquiror upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of the
Company, or if any representation or warranty of the Company shall be or
become untrue, in any case such that the conditions set forth in _Section
9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.2(b)_ would not be satisfied (assuming that the date of
such determination is the

 



      
 

 



 

Closing Date); _provided_ that if such breach is curable by the Company prior
to the Termination Date through the exercise of its commercially reasonable
efforts and the Company continues to exercise such commercially reasonable
efforts, Acquiror may not terminate this Agreement prior to the Termination
Date under this _Section 10.1(g)_ ; _provided further_ that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 10.1(g)_ shall not be available
to Acquiror if it has failed to perform in any material respect any of its

issued as contemplated by such clauses; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror
shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 10.1(h)_
if (i) the failure of such consents, "comfort" or "bring down comfort" letters
to be delivered is due to the failure of Acquiror to cooperate reasonably with
any reasonable request of the independent accountants of the Company or (ii)
at the time Acquiror seeks to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
10.1(h)_ , the Company has a right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 10.(b)_ , _Section 10.1(c)_ or _Section 10.1(f)_.

 



 

 _Section 10.2_ _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

Except as provided in (i) this _Section 10.2_ , (ii) _Section 10.4_ and (iii)
the Confidentiality Agreement, in the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become
void, and there will be no liability on the part of the Acquiror Companies or
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective officers or
directors to the other and all rights and obligations of any party hereto will
cease, except that nothing herein will relieve any party from liability from
fraud or a deliberate or willful breach of this Agreement, prior to
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, in which case the
aggrieved party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at Law
or in equity.

 



 

 _Section 10.3_ _Amendment_.

 



 

This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken by or on
behalf of their respective boards of directors at any time prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after approval of the Merger by

amount or kind of consideration to be received in exchange for all or any of
the Company Common Stock; (ii) alter or change any term of the Certificate of
Incorporation; or (iii) alter or change any of the terms and conditions of

amendment or modification to the second paragraph of _Section 12.8_ , the
second paragraph of _Section 12.9_ or _Section 12.13_ is sought which is
adverse to the rights of the Lender, the prior written consent of the Lender

contemplated hereby, or any matters forming the basis for such termination.

survive until fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date (such date, the "
_Expiration Date_ "). If written notice of a claim has been given prior to the
Expiration

obligations hereunder shall continue as to such matter until the Loss, if any,
to be satisfied shall have been determined pursuant to this _Article XI_ and,
if applicable, the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

 _Section 11.2_ _Indemnification of Acquiror Indemnified Parties_.

 



 

(a) After the Effective Time, and subject to the provisions of this _Article
XI_ and the Escrow Agreement, Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation and its and
their respective officers, directors, employees and shareholders
(collectively, the " _Acquiror Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be indemnified
and held harmless solely from the Indemnification Escrow Amount (subject to
_Section 11.7_ ) from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
interest, awards, judgments, penalties and out-of-pocket expenses (including
reasonable attorneys and consultants fees and expenses) actually suffered or
incurred by them (including, without limitation, in connection with any Third-
Party Claim) (hereinafter, a " _Loss_ " and collectively, " _Losses_ "),
arising out of, relating to or resulting from (without duplication):

 



 

(i) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by
the Company in this Agreement or contained in any certificate required to be
delivered hereunder; or

 



 

(ii) the failure of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the

After the Effective Time, the Company Equityholders and their respective

indemnified and held harmless by the Surviving Corporation for any and all
Losses, arising out of or resulting from (without duplication):

 



      
 

 



 

(c) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by
Acquiror or Merger Sub in this Agreement or contained in any certificate
required to be delivered hereunder; or

 



 

(d) the failure of Acquiror or Merger Sub to perform or comply with any
covenant or agreement made by Acquiror or Merger Sub in this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement.

 



 

 _Section 11.4_ _Limits on Indemnification_.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, except
for (a) fraud and (b) breaches of any representations or warranties contained
in _Section 5.1_ (Organization), _Section 5.2_ (Capitalization), _Section 5.3_
(Authorization; Validity of Agreement), _Section 5.17_ (Brokers or Finders),
_Section 6.1_ (Organization), _Section 6.2_ (Authorization; Validity of
Agreement) and _Section 6.8_ (Brokers or Finders), neither the Acquiror
Indemnified Parties nor the Shareholder Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 11.3(c)_
unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses equals or
exceeds $2,500,000 (the " _Indemnity Trigger_ "), after which all such Losses,
back to dollar one, shall be recoverable; _provided_ that only individual
claims or claims arising out of the same set of facts that exceed $50,000
shall be counted as Losses for which indemnification may be pursued or shall
be counted towards the Indemnity Trigger. Indemnifiable Losses of the Acquiror
Indemnified Parties shall be payable solely from (and shall not exceed the
amount available in) the Indemnification Escrow Account (after giving effect
to any prior distributions therefrom).

 



 

 _Section 11.5_ _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(e) For purposes of this _Section 11.5_ , a party against which
indemnification may be sought is referred to as the " _Indemnifying Party_ "
and the party which may be entitled to indemnification is referred to as the "
_Indemnified Party_."

 



 

(f) The obligations of the Indemnifying Parties under this _Article XI_ with
respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party which are subject to
the indemnification provided for in this _Article XI_ (" _Third-Party Claims_
") shall be governed by the following additional terms and conditions:

 



 

(i) If an Indemnified Party shall receive written notice of any Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall promptly give all Indemnifying Parties
(which in the case of Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall consist of notice to
the Shareholder Representative, who shall be deemed to be the Indemnifying
Party for purposes of this _Section 11.5_ ) notice of such Third-Party Claim;
provided that failure so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party from any liability which the Indemnifying Party may
have on account of this indemnity or otherwise, except and only to the extent
the Indemnifying Party shall have been materially prejudiced by such failure
in connection

 



      
 

 



 

with the administration or defense of such Third-Party Claim. The notice of
claim shall describe in reasonable detail the facts known to the Indemnified
Party giving rise to such Third-Party Claim, and the amount, or good faith
estimate of the amount, of Losses arising therefrom. The Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the Indemnified
Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to a Third-Party Claim;

 



 

(ii) The Indemnifying Party (through the Shareholder Representative, in the
case of any indemnity provided to a Acquiror Indemnified Party) shall be
entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third-Party Claim at its
expense and through counsel of its choice (such counsel to be reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party) if it gives written notice of its
intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after the
receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Party (or such earlier date as an
answer may be due in connection with any applicable legal proceeding) in which
case the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
any fees of counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such
Third-Party Claim incurred after the Indemnified Party receives such notice
from the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Indemnified
Party reasonably determines based upon the written advice of counsel that a
conflict of interest exists that would make it inappropriate for the same
counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party,
then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not in such event be responsible hereunder for the
fees and expenses of more than one firm of separate counsel in connection with
any Third-Party Claim in the same jurisdiction, in addition to any local
counsel. In the event that the Indemnifying Party exercises the right to
undertake any such defense against such Third-Party Claim as provided above,
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such
defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying
Partys expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information
in the Indemnified Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party.
Similarly, in the event the Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly,
conducting the defense against any such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make
available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, all
such witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnifying Partys
possession or under the Indemnifying Partys control relating thereto as is
reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. No compromise or settlement of
such Third-Party Claim may be effected by either the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Parties without the other partys consent (which shall not be

 



       
 

 



 

unreasonably withheld or delayed); other than a compromise or settlement
agreed to by the Indemnifying Party in which (i) there is no finding or
admission of any violation of Law and no effect on any other claims that may
be made against each Indemnified Party that is a party to such claim and (ii)
each Indemnified Party that is party to such claim is released from liability
with respect to such claim; and

 



 

(iii) A claim for indemnification for any matter not constituting a Third-
Party Claim shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party by written notice to
the Indemnifying Party (which in the case of Acquiror Indemnified Parties
shall consist of notice to the Shareholder Representative, who shall be deemed
to be the Indemnifying Party for purposes of this _Section 11.5_) as
specified in the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

 _Section 11.6_ _Delivery and Release from Escrow Account_.

 



 

Upon the final resolution of any indemnification claim for which a cash
payment is to be made to a Acquiror Indemnified Party, Acquiror and the
Shareholder Representative shall take such actions as may be necessary or
appropriate to cause the Escrow Agent to make such payment from funds in the
Indemnification Escrow Account.

 



 

 _Section 11.7_ _Exclusive Remedy_.

 



 

Following the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy for each of the Acquiror
Indemnified Parties and Shareholder Indemnified Parties with respect to any
and all claims and Losses relating to a breach of this Agreement (other than
claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud or willful misconduct)
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article
XI_ and shall be limited (a) in the case of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties,
to recovery of amounts available in the Indemnification Escrow Account in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and no
such payment shall exceed the amount of the Indemnification Escrow Amount
available on any given payment date and (b) in the case of the Shareholder
Indemnified Parties, to recovery of an aggregate amount equal to the
Indemnification Escrow Amount. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the
Acquiror Indemnified Parties and the Shareholder Indemnified Parties hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims of, or causes of action
arising from, fraud or willful misconduct) it may have following the Closing
against the other parties hereto, arising under or based upon any federal,
state, local or foreign Law, other than the right to seek indemnity pursuant
to this _Article XI_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, but subject to _Section 10.4(d)_, this _Section 11.7_ shall not
limit a partys right to specific performance or injunctive relief in
connection with the other partys breach of its covenants in this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 11.8_ _Merger Consideration Adjustment_.

 



 

Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this _Article XI_ shall be
treated by the parties as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for Tax
purposes.

 



 

 _Section 11.9_ _No Consequential or Other Damages_.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
Indemnifying Party shall be liable to or otherwise responsible for
consequential, incidental, special or punitive damages or lost profits.

 



 

 _Section 11.10_ _Release of Funds from Indemnification Escrow Account_.

 



 

On the Expiration Date, the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, shall release to the Shareholder Representative (for the benefit of
the former Company Equityholders) the amount of funds remaining in the
Indemnification Escrow Account less the amount of any Losses properly claimed
by any Acquiror Indemnified Party pursuant to the terms of this _Article XI_
for which final resolution shall not have been obtained. Thereafter, the
Escrow Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, shall release to
the Shareholder Representative (for the benefit of the Company Equityholders),
upon resolution of any claim of an Acquiror Indemnified Party outstanding as
of the Expiration Date, funds in an amount, if any, equal to the amount by
which the Losses for any such claim were finally determined to be exceeded the
Losses clamed as of the Expiration Date.

 



 

 _Section 11.11_ _Adjustment for Insurance_.

 



 

If any Losses sustained by an Indemnified Party are covered by an insurance
policy or an indemnification, contribution or similar obligation of another
person (other than an Affiliate of such Indemnified Party), the Indemnified
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect such insurance
proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar payments. If the Indemnified
Party receives insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar
payments prior to being indemnified, held harmless and reimbursed under
_Section 11.2_ or _Section 11.3_, as applicable, with respect to such
Losses, the payment by the Indemnifying Party under this _Article XI_ with
respect to such Losses shall be reduced by the net amount of such insurance
proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar payments to the extent related
to such Losses (less reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses actually
incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with such recovery and not
reimbursed by such third party source). If the Indemnified Party receives such
insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar payments after being
indemnified and held harmless by an Indemnifying Party with respect to such
Losses, the Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party (or shall
deposit into the Indemnification Escrow Account, in the event the Indemnified
Party is an Acquiror Indemnified Party and the insurance recovery occurs on or
before the later to occur of (a) the resolution of all claims to which
indemnity has been sought or (b) the Expiration Date) the net amount of such
insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar payment to the extent
related to such Losses (less reasonable attorneys fees and

 



      
 

 



 

other expenses actually incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
such recovery and not reimbursed by such third party source).

 



 

 _Section 11.12_ _Tax Benefits_.

 



 

The amount of any indemnifiable Losses under this Agreement shall be net of
any Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the
incurrence or payment of such Losses or the event that gave rise to such
Losses and any correlative adjustments resulting from such Losses (for the
avoidance of doubt, if a Tax benefit is actually realized by the Indemnified
Party after the payment of any indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified
Party shall promptly pay over the amount of such Tax benefit to the
Indemnifying Party when such Tax benefit is actually realized (or, in the
event the Indemnifying Party is or would have been the Escrow Agent, the
Shareholder Representative on behalf of the Company Equityholders)).

 _Section 12.6_ _Severability_.

 



 

If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a
court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void,
unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

 



 

 _Section 12.7_ _Governing Law_.

 



 

This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware applicable to contracts to be made and performed
entirely therein without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law
thereof or of any other jurisdiction.

 



 

 _Section 12.8_ _Jurisdiction_.

 



 

Each of the parties hereto hereby expressly and irrevocably submits to the
non-exclusive personal jurisdiction of the United States District Court for
the District of Delaware and to the jurisdiction of any other competent court
of the State of Delaware located in the County of New Castle (collectively,
the " _Delaware Courts_ "), preserving, however, all rights of removal to such
federal court under 28 U.S.C. Section 1441, in connection with all disputes
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto
except in such courts. If the aforementioned courts do not have subject matter
jurisdiction, then the proceeding shall be brought in any other state or
federal court located in the State of Delaware, preserving, however, all
rights of removal to such federal court under 28 U.S.C. Section 1441. Each
party hereby waives the right to any other jurisdiction or venue for any
litigation arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby to which any of them may be entitled by
reason of its present or future domicile. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
of the parties hereto agrees that each of the other parties shall have the
right to bring any action or proceeding for enforcement of a judgment entered
by the Delaware Courts in any other court or jurisdiction.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the
parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against the Lender in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Lender, the Commitment
Letter (including the transactions contemplated therein) or the performance
thereof or the Financing or the Acquisition Financing, in any forum other than
the

 



      
 

 



 

Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof).

 



 

 _Section 12.9_ _Specific Performance_.

 



 

Subject to _Section 10.4(d)_, each of the parties hereto acknowledges and
agrees that in the event of any breach of this Agreement, each non-breaching
party would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not be made whole
by monetary damages. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to _Section
10.4(d)_, the parties hereto (a) will waive, in any action for specific
performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and (b) shall be
entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law
or in equity, to compel specific performance of this Agreement in any action
instituted in accordance with this Agreement. In circumstances where Acquiror
and Merger Sub or the Company is obligated to consummate the Merger and the
Merger has not been consummated (other than as a result of the other partys
refusal to close in violation of this Agreement) each of the Company, Acquiror
and Merger Sub expressly acknowledges and agrees that the other party shall
have suffered irreparable harm, that, subject to _Section 10.4(d)_, monetary
damages will be inadequate to compensate such other party, and that, subject
to _Section 10.4(d)_, such other party shall be entitled to enforce
specifically Acquirors and Merger Subs or the Companys, as the case may be,
obligation to consummate the Merger.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
acknowledges it is not a third party beneficiary of the Commitment Letter and
the Lender will not have any liability to the Company or its Affiliates
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter, the
Acquisition Financing, the Alternative Financing or the Financing, whether at
law, or equity, in contract, tort or otherwise. In no event shall the Company
be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of the Agreement
against the Lender.

 



 

 _Section 12.10_ _Assignment_.

 



 

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation
of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective
permitted successors and assigns.

 



 

 _Section 12.11_ _Headings_.

 



 

Headings of the articles and sections of this Agreement, the Disclosure
Schedules and the Table of Contents are for convenience of the parties only,
and shall be given no substantive or interpretative effect whatsoever.

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 12.12_ _Waivers_.

 



 

At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
party hereto; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto; and (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements
or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver will be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties
to be bound thereby. Any such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with such obligation, representation, warranty, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure. For purposes of this _Section 12.12_, the
Acquiror Companies will be deemed to be one party. To the extent any waiver
relating to the second paragraph of _Section 12.8,_ the second paragraph of
_Section 12.9 _or _Section 12.13_ is adverse to the rights of the Lender,
the prior written consent of the Lender shall be required before such waiver
is rendered effective.

 



 

 _Section 12.13_ _Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

Each of the parties hereto hereby, irrevocably waives all right to trial by
jury and any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract,
tort, or otherwise) arising out of or relating to any claims alleged against
the Lender in connection with the Financing or the Acquisition Financing.

 



 

 _Section 12.14_ _Schedules_.

 



 

The Disclosure Schedules shall be construed with and as an integral part of
this Agreement to the same extent as if the same had been set forth verbatim
herein. Any matter disclosed pursuant to the Disclosure Schedules shall be
deemed to be disclosed for all purposes under this Agreement but such
disclosure shall not be deemed to be an admission or representation as to the
materiality of the item so disclosed.

 



      
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be signed
by their respective officers as of the date first written above.
