 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Board_ "), with the recommendation of the special committee of the Board (the " _Special Committee_ "), has (i) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and the stockholders of the Company, and declared it advisable, for the Company to enter into this Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub providing for the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, (ii) approved this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and (iii) resolved to recommend adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company; and 

  

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub have each approved, and the Board of Directors of Merger Sub has declared it advisable for Merger Sub to enter into, this Agreement providing for the Merger in accordance with the DGCL, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows: 

  

Article I 

   

THE MERGER  

  

 Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time (as defined below), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). 

  

 Section 1.2 _Closing; Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of Article VII, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Ropes and Gray LLP, 45 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, New York, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the earlier of (i) the later of (A) the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) and (B) the Termination Date (as defined below) and (ii) the tenth business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, but subject to the 

   ##### 

  

    

satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), or at such other place or on such
other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to effect the
Closing prior to the final day of the Marketing Period. For purposes of this
Agreement, the " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean the period of 20
consecutive business days after the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed
to the Companys shareholders. The date on which the Closing actually occurs
is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ". At the Closing, the
parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing
a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed
in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of

State of Delaware, or such later time as is specified in the Certificate of
Merger and as is agreed to by the Company and Parent, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ") and shall make all other filings
required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger. 

  

 Section 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. From and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; By-Laws_. (a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time ( _provided_ that the form and substance thereof shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company), shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by law.

   ##### 

  

    

benefit of the stockholders of the Company and, if applicable, the holders of
Options in the amount of any such losses and (ii) such investments shall be
in short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of
no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed
by the full faith and credit of the United States of America or in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively. Any interest or
income produced by, or profit resulting from, such investments will be
payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. 

  

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, but in any event within three business days following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of (i) an outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or (ii) Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such Shares for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration therefor. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares and such Certificate or book-entry shall then be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment of such applicable Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer or be accompanied by all documents required to evidence transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of such applicable Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.4(b), each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration therefor as contemplated by this Article II. 

  

 (c) All payments with respect to Options that are cancelled pursuant to Section 2.2, to the extent not made at the Effective Time, shall be made by the Paying Agent as soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than five (5) days after the Effective Time) from funds deposited by or at the direction of Parent to pay such amounts in accordance with 2.4(a). 

  

 (d) At any time following the date that is twelve months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds 

   ##### 

  

    

(including any interest, income or profits received with respect thereto)
which have been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been
disbursed to holders of Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or Options and, after
such funds have been delivered to the Surviving Corporation, such holders
shall be entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration payable upon due
surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or with respect to the
Option Consideration payable with respect to their cancelled Options. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of
the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the applicable
Merger Consideration therefor and the payment of Option Consideration.
Neither the Surviving Corporation, Parent nor the Paying Agent will be liable
to any person entitled to payment under this Article II for any consideration
which is properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

 (e) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, all Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in, this Article II. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any former holder of Shares or Options pursuant to this Agreement any amount as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax laws. To the extent that amounts are so properly withheld by Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or Options, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. 

  

 (g) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holders compliance with the replacement requirements established by the Surviving Corporation, including, if necessary, the posting by the holder of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to the Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable consideration payable in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate pursuant to this Article II.

   ##### 

  

    

contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (except for such changes
specifically necessary in order for the Company to be able to comply with its

Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal. A " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean an Acquisition Proposal (with
all percentages in the definition of Acquisition Proposal increased to 50%)
that, if accepted, is reasonably capable of being consummated, taking into
account legal, financial, regulatory, timing and similar aspects of the

point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. The

subsidiaries and its subsidiaries officers and directors will and (iii) it
shall ensure that its and its subsidiaries Representatives will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,

   ##### 

  

    

itself shall entitle Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(e)), and (B) Parent does not, within three business days following its
receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, make an offer that, as determined
by the Board and, if applicable, the Special Committee with respect to the
holders of Company Common Stock, in good faith after consultation with their
respective outside legal counsel and financial advisors, results in the
applicable Acquisition Proposal no longer being a Superior Proposal (provided
that, during such three business day period, the Company shall negotiate in
good faith with Parent, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable
Parent to make such offer). 

  

 Section 6.6 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_. (a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof, to maintain for any Company Employee base compensation and benefits that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the base compensation and benefits maintained for and provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , subject to compliance with the foregoing, that nothing herein shall (i) prevent the amendment or termination of any Company Plan or any Employment Agreement or (ii) interfere with the Surviving Corporations right or obligation to make such changes as are necessary to conform with applicable law. 

  

 (b) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, give Company Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting and benefit accruals (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plans), under any employee compensation and incentive plans, benefit (including vacation) plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained for the benefit of Company Employees as of and after the Effective Time by Parent, its subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation for the Company Employees service with the Company, its subsidiaries and their predecessor entities (each, a " _Parent Plan_ ") to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. With respect to each Parent Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent or its subsidiaries shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Company Employees under similar plans maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) This Section 6.6 is not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any such person may have under any employment agreement or Company Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each (as of the Effective Time) present and former officer and director of the Company and its subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements (collectively, " _Costs_ "), incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, 

    ##### 

 

  

employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
joint ventures, including without limitation matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions
and actions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
law. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, (x) each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation from Parent or the Surviving Corporation within ten business
days of receipt by Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified
Party of a request therefor; _provided_ that any person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the
DGCL, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person
is not entitled to indemnification, (y) neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any proceeding or threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or
claim (and in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents, and (z) Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, cooperate in the
defense of any such matter.

 (c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, either (i) cause to be obtained at the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies, at no expense to the beneficiaries, with a claims period of six years from the Effective Time, from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance in an amount and scope and on terms at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as the Companys current policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time or (ii) maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six years from the Effective Time, the current policies of the directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company ( _provided_ that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance in an amount and scope and on terms at least as favorable, in the aggregate, as the Companys current policies) with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay annual premiums pursuant to this Section 6.7(c) of more than an amount equal to 300% of the current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance.

Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. 

  

 (b) Parent and Merger Sub shall use, and shall cause their affiliates to use, their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Financing, including in the case of the Debt Financing using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Commitments, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to obtaining the Financing set forth therein to be fulfilled by Parent and Merger Sub (including by consummating the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity Financing Commitments), (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments and (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to the time at which Parent and Merger Sub shall be required to effect the Closing.

   ##### 

  

    

of the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to the
Financing, in each case, without the Companys prior written consent, except
as would not materially impair or delay the consummation of the Financing and
is not, individually or in the aggregate, otherwise material. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall obtaining any
or all of the Financing be a condition to the obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub to effect the Closing. 

  

 Section 6.11 _Termination of Warrants_. The Company, Parent, Merger Sub and each holder of outstanding Warrants have entered into an agreement providing for the termination at the Effective Time of each of the Warrants that is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time, a fully executed copy of which has been delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub on or prior to the execution of this Agreement, and each such Warrant shall terminate in accordance therewith as of the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 6.12 _Debt Tender_. (a) On such date designated by Parent (which shall be at least three business days after the date on which the Company received such notice from Parent), the Company shall commence a tender offer and Consent Solicitation (each, a " _Debt Offer_ ") for (i) all of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes and (ii) all of the outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes (the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes, collectively, the " _Notes_ ") upon the terms and conditions set forth in writing by Parent and as set forth in this Section 6.12, and otherwise in compliance with law and SEC rules and regulations, and Parent and Merger Sub shall provide all cooperation reasonably requested by the Company in connection therewith. 

  

 (b) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with each Debt Offer, including the offer to purchase, related letters of transmittal and other related documents (collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Offer Documents. All mailings to the holders of the Notes in connection with each Debt Offer shall be subject to the prior review and comment by each of the Company and Parent and shall be reasonably acceptable to each of them. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate in connection with each Debt Offer in order to cause the consent date under the Consent Solicitation and initial settlement of such Debt Offer to occur simultaneously with the Closing. The Company shall, and shall cause its applicable subsidiaries to, waive any of the conditions to each Debt Offer (other than that the conditions to the consummation of the Merger shall have been satisfied or waived and that there shall be no order or injunction prohibiting consummation of such Debt Offer) as may be reasonably requested by Parent and shall not, without the consent of Parent, waive any condition to such Debt Offer or make any changes to the terms and conditions of such Debt Offer other than as agreed between Parent and the Company. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the Company need not make any change to the terms and conditions of such Debt Offer requested by Parent that decreases the price per Note payable in such Debt Offer or imposes conditions to the Debt Offer in addition to those previously set forth in writing by Parent in accordance with the foregoing Section 6.12(a) that are materially adverse to holders of the Notes, unless such change is approved by the Company in writing. If, at any time prior to the completion of the Debt Offer, any information in the Offer Documents should be discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be 

   ##### 

  

    

stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
disseminated by the Company to the holders of the Notes. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 6.12, the Company shall comply with
the requirements of Rule 14e-l under the Exchange Act and any other
applicable law to the extent such laws are applicable in connection with the
Debt Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any applicable law conflict
with this Section 6.12(b), the Company shall comply with the applicable
law and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations hereunder by
such compliance. 

  

 (c) Promptly upon the receipt of the Requested Consents with respect to the Senior Secured Indenture and the Senior Subordinated Indenture, respectively, the Company shall enter into a supplemental indenture reflecting the amendments to each of the Senior Secured Indenture and the Senior Subordinated Indenture, respectively, approved by such Requested Consents and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the respective indenture trustee to promptly enter into the respective supplemental indenture; _provided_ , that the amendments contained in such supplemental indentures shall become operative upon the acceptance of the applicable Debt Offer. The closing of each Debt Offer shall be conditioned on the simultaneous occurrence of the Closing. Simultaneously with the Closing and in accordance with the terms of the Debt Offers, Parent shall provide to the Company the funds necessary to consummate the Debt Offers and Consent Solicitation and the Company shall accept for purchase and use such funds to purchase the Notes tendered in the Debt Offers. 

  

 (d) If requested by Parent, the Company shall enter into one or more customary dealer-manager agreements with such persons as Parent shall reasonably request. 

  

 (e) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Consent Solicitation_ " shall mean a solicitation of the Requested Consents from the holders of the Notes and (ii) " _Requested Consents_ " shall mean (x) with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, such consents of the holders of Senior Secured Notes as are required under the Senior Secured Indenture to approve the amendments thereto set forth in writing by Parent in accordance with the foregoing Section 6.12(a) and (y) with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes, such consents of the holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes as are required under the Senior Subordinated Indenture to approve the amendments to the Senior Subordinated Indenture set forth in writing by Parent in accordance with the foregoing Section 6.12(a). 

  

 (f) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1 other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by the Company, then Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Company or its subsidiaries in connection with the Debt Offers and shall indemnify the Company for any liabilities incurred by the Company pursuant to the Debt Offers, except to the extent that the Companys actions are or were inconsistent with the proper instructions of Parent or the terms of this Section 6.12. 

  

 (g) In the event that this Agreement is terminated, the Company shall have the right to modify and/or terminate either or both of the Debt Offers without Parents consent.

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) by the Company (i) if there shall have been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement such that any condition set forth in subsection (a) or (b) of Section 7.3 would not be satisfied and, in either such case, such breach shall not have been cured prior to the earlier of (A) 10 business days following notice of such breach to Parent and (B) the Termination Date; _provided_ that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)(i) if the Company is then in material breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or (ii) in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, Section 6.5(b);

   ##### 

  

    

within twelve months after such termination, the Company enters into a

case of a payment required by clause (i)(A) above, at or prior to the date of
termination of this Agreement, (2) in the case of a payment required by
clause (i)(B) above, as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any

Agreement and (3) in the case of a payment required by clause (ii) above, on
the earliest date that the Company enters into definitive agreements with

Proposal referred to in clause (ii)(C) above. For purposes of this Section
8.2(b), the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to
such term in Section 6.5(a), but with all percentages therein increased to
50%. 

  

 (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(f), and no amount is payable to Parent pursuant to Section 8.2(b), then the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to the sum of all Parent Expenses up to $1,942,000 of such Parent Expenses in the aggregate. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Parent Expenses_ " includes all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including, without limitation, all fees and expenses of financing sources (including those who are parties to the Financing Commitments), counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to Parent and its affiliates) incurred by Parent or on its behalf in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Financing.

 (d) In the event that the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 are satisfied or waived but there is a failure to receive the proceeds of the Debt Financing (a " _Debt Receipt Failure_ "), and Parent or Merger Sub breaches, whether or not intentionally, its obligation to effect the Closing pursuant to Article I and to satisfy its obligations to fund (or cause to be funded) all payments pursuant to Article II and any other payments contemplated hereunder to be funded at or prior to the Closing, then, upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Parent shall pay to the Company an amount equal to $15,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of same day funds as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of termination of this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if in the circumstances in which Parent becomes obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee, the failure of Parent or Merger Sub to fund (or cause to be funded) all payments pursuant to Article II and any other payments contemplated hereunder to be funded at or prior to the Closing is due solely to a Debt Receipt Failure and neither Parent nor Merger Sub otherwise is in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder, then, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Companys right to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(d) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy, at law or in equity, available to the Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries against Parent and Merger Sub and any of their respective former, current, or future general or limited partners, members or stockholders or against any of their respective former, current, or future general or limited partners, members, stockholders, directors, officers, managers, affiliates or agents (each a " _Specified Person_ "), with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated, under any theory or for any reason, and upon payment of such amount, none of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Specified Persons shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.2(e) shall not apply with respect to the obligations set forth in the final sentence of Section 6.10(a), in Section 6.12(f) or in the final sentence of Section 8.3. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of any termination of this Agreement by Parent under the circumstances set forth in clause (i) or (ii) of Section 8.2(b), then anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Parents right to receive payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(b) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy, at law or in equity, available to Parent and Merger Sub and their respective affiliates and subsidiaries against the Company and its subsidiaries and any of their respective Specified Persons with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated, under any theory or for any reason, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective Specified Persons shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event, whether or not this Agreement shall have been terminated, shall the Company and its subsidiaries, as a group, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, as a group, on the other hand, be subject to monetary damages in excess of $25,000,000 in the aggregate for each such group, respectively, for all losses and damages arising from or in connection with breaches by Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or by the Company, on the other hand, of their respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement (other than those set forth in Section 8.3 and Section 6.12(f), for which the limitations set forth in this Section 8.2(g) shall not apply), and none of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Specified Persons shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than for fraud. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (h) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that without these agreements the Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement, and that each of the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee, to the extent that either may become payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, constitutes liquidated damages and not a penalty. 

  

 Section 8.3 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each party shall bear its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company. 

  

 Section 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment may be made which by law requires the further approval of the stockholders of the Company without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto. 

  

 Section 8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) subject to the requirements of applicable law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. The failure of any party to assert any rights or remedies shall not constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies.

interpretation against the party drafting or causing any instrument to be

 (b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule will not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in such Schedule, that such information is required to be listed therein or that any such items are material to the Company and its subsidiaries or to Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be. The headings, if any, of the individual sections of each such Schedule are inserted for convenience only and will not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement.
