a Notice of Disagreement, only those matters that the Seller specifies in such Notice of Disagreement as being in disagreement

of Disagreement once it has been delivered to the Purchaser in accordance with this <U>Section 2.6(c)</U>, except in connection

and the basis for such alternative calculation, and the Seller&rsquo;s alternative calculation of the Purchase Price after taking
into account the Seller&rsquo;s alternative amount of each Disputed Item. Any component of the calculations set forth in the Closing
Adjustment Statement that is not the subject of a timely delivered Notice of Disagreement and a properly included Disputed Item
in accordance with this <U>Section 2.6(c)</U> by the Seller shall be final and binding upon the Parties, unless the resolution
of any Disputed Item affects an undisputed component of the Closing Adjustment Statement, in which case such undisputed component
shall, notwithstanding the failure to object to such component in the Notice of Disagreement, be considered a Disputed Item to
the extent affected by such resolved Disputed Item.</P>

Accounting Firm (acting solely as an expert and not as an arbitrator) based on the definitions related to the Purchase Price set
forth herein and otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The Neutral Accounting Firm shall be instructed
to make such determination with respect to the Unresolved Objections and not to assign a value to any Disputed Item that is (i)
greater than the greatest value for such Disputed Item claimed by either the Seller or the Purchaser or (ii) lower than the lowest
value for such Disputed Item claimed by either the Seller or the Purchaser. The Parties shall provide the Neutral Accounting Firm
with all necessary documents as requested by it as soon as possible and shall instruct the Neutral Accounting Firm to render its
decision in accordance with the terms set forth in this <U>Section 2.6</U> and as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any
event no later than thirty (30) days after the referral of the Unresolved Objections to the Neutral Accounting Firm). The Neutral
Accounting Firm shall be instructed to grant the Parties the opportunity to state their points of view and, if the Neutral Accounting
Firm determines that a hearing would be appropriate, the Neutral Accounting Firm may conduct a hearing on the Unresolved Objections.
All submissions by the Seller or the Purchaser to the Neutral Accounting Firm shall be in writing and shall simultaneously be delivered
to the other Party and there shall be no ex parte communication with the Neutral Accounting Firm. The Neutral Accounting Firm shall
be instructed to submit its decision and its reasoning in writing to the Parties. Absent fraud, intentional misconduct or manifest
error, the resolution by the Neutral Accounting Firm of the Unresolved Objections shall be final and binding upon the Parties.
The fees and disbursements of the Neutral Accounting Firm shall be allocated between the Seller and the Purchaser on an inversely
proportional basis, based on the relative portions of the aggregate amount of Unresolved Objections so submitted to the Neutral
Accounting Firm for resolution that ultimately are awarded to each of the Seller and the Purchaser by the Neutral Accounting Firm
in its final determination (e.g., if $100,000 is in dispute, and of that amount the Neutral Accounting Firm awards $75,000 to the
Purchaser and $25,000 to the Seller, then the Purchaser will be responsible for 25%, and the Seller will be responsible for 75%,
of the costs, fees and expenses of the Neutral Accounting Firm).</P>

Transferred Contract or Purchased Asset, (i) the Seller will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to, without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser, amend, modify, terminate, or waive any of their respective rights or accelerate any of their respective

its Subsidiaries to, exercise and enforce all rights and pursue all remedies in respect thereof on behalf of and at the direction

obligations and bear the related economic burdens in respect of such Shared Contract, including by means of subcontracting, sublicensing
or subleasing arrangements, or enforcement by the party to such Shared Contract for the benefit (and at the expense) of the other
party that is an intended beneficiary thereof.&nbsp; For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates bear any costs, payments, fees or Liabilities under any Shared Contract to the extent that such costs, payments, fees

between this <U>Section 2.9</U> and the Consent Agreement with respect to any Transform Contract that is a Shared Contract, the
Consent Agreement shall govern with respect to such conflict. The Seller agrees (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to agree) to

any of its Subsidiaries&rsquo; (other than the Transferred Entities&rsquo;) rights and obligations relating to the Business under

</FONT></FONT>If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice from a third party of any Action, audit, demand or assessment (each,
a &ldquo;<U>Third Party Claim</U>&rdquo;) against it which could reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim for Loss under
this <U>Article VIII</U>, as promptly as reasonably practicable following (and in any event within thirty (30) days of) the receipt
of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third Party Claim; <U>provided</U> that
the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this <U>Article VIII</U>
except to the extent that the defenses or other rights available to the Indemnifying Party are actually and materially prejudiced
by such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense
and through counsel of its choice if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days
of the receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Party; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Indemnifying Party not be entitled
to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim, and shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified
Party in defending such Third Party Claim, if, (A) there are legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are different
from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party, (B) there exists a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party, (C) such Third Party Claim seeks non-monetary relief (including injunctive or other equitable
relief) or (D) there is a criminal or regulatory enforcement Action brought by any Governmental Authority, or any other dispute
involving the Indemnified Party, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority, on the other hand. If the Indemnifying Party
elects to undertake any such defense against a Third Party Claim the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own
expense. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party&rsquo;s expense,
in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party&rsquo;s expense, all pertinent records,
materials and information in the Indemnified Party&rsquo;s possession or under the Indemnified Party&rsquo;s control relating thereto
as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to direct the defense of any such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of such Third Party Claim unless the Indemnifying
Party consents in writing to such payment or unless a final judgment from which no appeal may be taken by or on behalf of the Indemnifying
Party is entered against the Indemnified Party for such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of any
such claims or proceeding pursuant to this <U>Section 8.5</U> or if the Indemnifying Party does not assume and conduct the defense
of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may continue to defend such Third Party Claim at the sole cost of the Indemnifying
Party, and the Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, the defense of such Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying
Party&rsquo;s sole cost and expense.</P>
