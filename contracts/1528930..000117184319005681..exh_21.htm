Section 2.6   _Adjustment of the Closing Payment_.

  

(a)  Within seventy-five (75) days after the Closing Date, the

Capital Adjustment Amount, (ii) the Employee Costs Amount and each of its
three components, (iii) the Transaction Expenses and (iv) the Purchase Price

connection with the resolution of any disputes contemplated by this _Section
2.6_.

  

(b)  For a period of sixty (60) days following the delivery of
the Closing Adjustment Statement (the " _Review Period_ "), the Purchaser
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, permit the Seller and its
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours upon
reasonable advance notice, to the relevant financial books and records of the
Business and the employees of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries responsible
for the preparation of the Closing Adjustment Statement solely for the
purposes of the Seller's exercise of its review and objection right
contemplated in this _Section 2.6_. If the Purchaser employs a firm of
independent accountants in connection with the preparation of the Closing
Adjustment Statement, subject to the execution by the Seller of a customary

 | 26| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(c)  The Seller shall notify the Purchaser within the Review
Period if the Seller objects to any matter set forth in the Closing
Adjustment Statement, which notice shall include a reasonably detailed
statement describing the basis for such objection and the Seller's proposed
correction(s) (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ "). If no Notice of Disagreement
is received by the Purchaser within the Review Period, then the Closing
Adjustment Statement and the amounts set forth therein shall be deemed to
have been accepted by the Seller and will become final and binding upon the
Parties. If the Seller timely delivers a Notice of Disagreement, only those
matters that the Seller specifies in such Notice of Disagreement as being in
disagreement shall be deemed to be in dispute (such matters, the " _Disputed
Items_ "). The Seller may not modify its Notice of Disagreement once it has
been delivered to the Purchaser in accordance with this _Section 2.6(c)_ ,
except in connection with the resolution of any disputes contemplated by this
_Section 2.6_. The Notice of Disagreement shall set forth in
reasonable detail each Disputed Item, the disputed amount of each Disputed
Item, the Seller's alternative amount of each Disputed Item and the basis for
such alternative calculation, and the Seller's alternative calculation of the
Purchase Price after taking into account the Seller's alternative amount of
each Disputed Item. Any component of the calculations set forth in the
Closing Adjustment Statement that is not the subject of a timely delivered
Notice of Disagreement and a properly included Disputed Item in accordance
with this _Section 2.6(c)_ by the Seller shall be final and binding upon the
Parties, unless the resolution of any Disputed Item affects an undisputed
component of the Closing Adjustment Statement, in which case such undisputed
component shall, notwithstanding the failure to object to such component in
the Notice of Disagreement, be considered a Disputed Item to the extent
affected by such resolved Disputed Item.

  

(d)  The Disputed Items shall be resolved as follows:

  

(i)  The Seller and the Purchaser shall first negotiate in
good faith to resolve the Disputed Items during the thirty (30) days
following delivery of the Notice of Disagreement. Any resolution agreed to in
writing by the Seller and the Purchaser as to any of the Disputed Items shall
be final and binding upon the Parties.

  

   

 | 27| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(ii)  If the Seller and the Purchaser do not reach a resolution
of all Disputed Items within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Notice of
Disagreement pursuant to _Section 2.6(d)(i)_ , then any such unresolved
objections (the " _Unresolved Objections_ ") shall be resolved conclusively
and bindingly for the Parties through a determination made by the
Neutral Accounting Firm (acting solely as an expert and not as an arbitrator)
based on the definitions related to the Purchase Price set forth herein and
otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The Neutral
Accounting Firm shall be instructed to make such determination with respect
to the Unresolved Objections and not to assign a value to any Disputed Item
that is (i) greater than the greatest value for such Disputed Item claimed by
either the Seller or the Purchaser or (ii) lower than the lowest value for
such Disputed Item claimed by either the Seller or the Purchaser. The Parties
shall provide the Neutral Accounting Firm with all necessary documents as
requested by it as soon as possible and shall instruct the Neutral Accounting
Firm to render its decision in accordance with the terms set forth in this
_Section 2.6_ and as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any event no
later than thirty (30) days after the referral of the Unresolved Objections to
the Neutral Accounting Firm). The Neutral Accounting Firm shall be instructed
to grant the Parties the opportunity to state their points of view and, if the
Neutral Accounting Firm determines that a hearing would be appropriate, the
Neutral Accounting Firm may conduct a hearing on the Unresolved
Objections. All submissions by the Seller or the Purchaser to the Neutral
Accounting Firm shall be in writing and shall simultaneously be delivered to
the other Party and there shall be no ex parte communication with the Neutral
Accounting Firm. The Neutral Accounting Firm shall be instructed to submit
its decision and its reasoning in writing to the Parties. Absent fraud,
intentional misconduct or manifest error, the resolution by the Neutral
Accounting Firm of the Unresolved Objections shall be final and binding upon
the Parties. The fees and disbursements of the Neutral Accounting Firm shall
be allocated between the Seller and the Purchaser on an
inversely proportional basis, based on the relative portions of the aggregate
amount of Unresolved Objections so submitted to the Neutral Accounting Firm
for resolution that ultimately are awarded to each of the Seller and the
Purchaser by the Neutral Accounting Firm in its final determination (e.g., if
$100,000 is in dispute, and of that amount the Neutral Accounting Firm awards
$75,000 to the Purchaser and $25,000 to the Seller, then the Purchaser will
be responsible for 25%, and the Seller will be responsible for 75%, of the
costs, fees and expenses of the Neutral Accounting Firm).

  

(e)  Within three (3) Business Days after the Closing Adjustment
Statement becomes final and binding upon the Parties pursuant to _Section
2.6(c)_ or the Closing Adjustment Statement (as modified) becomes final
pursuant to _Section 2.6(d)_ , one of the following payments shall be made:

  

(i)  If the Purchase Price, as finally determined in
accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.6_ , exceeds the
Closing Payment (such amount, the " _Closing Underpayment_ "), the Purchaser
shall pay to the Seller an amount equal to the Closing Underpayment to the
Seller Bank Account; _provided_ that in no event shall the Closing
Underpayment exceed $2,500,000.

  

(ii)  If the Purchase Price, as finally determined in accordance
with the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.6_ , is less than the
Closing Payment (such amount, the " _Closing Overpayment_ "), the Seller shall
pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to the Closing Overpayment to the
Purchaser Bank Account; _provided_ that in no event shall the Closing
Overpayment exceed $2,500,000.

  

Section 2.7   _Allocation of the Purchase Price_.

  

   

 | 28| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(a)  The Seller and the Purchaser agree to apportion and, as
applicable, to cause their relevant Affiliates to further apportion, the
Purchase Price and any other items that are treated as additional
consideration for Tax purposes (including the Assumed Liabilities) among the
Transferred Entities (including, as applicable, the assets and liabilities of
the Transferred Entities) and the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section
1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and
applicable rules in the jurisdiction in which the Transferred Entities and
Purchased Assets are located (the " _Apportionment Principles_ ") and the
procedures as set forth herein. No later than ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller a proposed
apportionment of the Purchase Price and any other items that are treated as
additional consideration for Tax purposes as of the Closing Date determined
in a manner consistent with the Apportionment Principles (the " _Interim
Apportionment_ "). If the Seller disagrees with the Interim Apportionment,
the Seller may, within forty-five (45) days after delivery of the
Interim Apportionment, deliver a notice (the " _Seller 's Apportionment
Notice_") to the Purchaser to such effect, specifying those items as to which
the Seller disagrees and setting forth the Seller's proposed apportionment.

  

(b)  If the Seller's Apportionment Notice is duly delivered, the
Seller and the Purchaser shall, during the fifteen (15) days following such
delivery, use commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the
disputed items or amounts in order to determine the allocation of the
Purchase Price and any other items that are treated as additional
consideration for Tax purposes. If the Seller and the Purchaser are unable to
reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause the Neutral
Accounting Firm to resolve any remaining disputes in accordance with the
terms and procedures set forth in _Section 2.6(d)(ii)_ , which shall apply to
this _Section 2.7(b)_ , _mutatis mutandis_. Any apportionment of the Purchase
Price and any other items that are treated as additional consideration for
Tax purposes determined pursuant to the decision of the Neutral Accounting
Firm shall incorporate, reflect and be consistent with the Apportionment
Principles. The Interim Apportionment, as prepared by the Purchaser if the
Seller's Apportionment Notice has not been given, as adjusted pursuant to any
agreement between the Seller and the Purchaser or as determined by the
Neutral Accounting Firm in accordance with the Apportionment Principles (the "
_Final Apportionment_ "), shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties. No
Party shall (and each shall cause their respective Affiliates not to) take
any position inconsistent with the Final Apportionment on any Tax Return or in
any Tax proceeding, in each case (i) except to the extent otherwise required
pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code (or any analogous provision of state, local or foreign law) or pursuant
to any other applicable Laws or (ii) without the consent of the other Party.
Any subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price including pursuant to
_Section 2.6_ shall be allocated among the Transferred Entities (including,
as applicable, the assets and liabilities of the Transferred Entities) and
the Purchased Assets in a manner that is consistent with the Final
Apportionment.

  

Section 2.8   _Non-Assignment; Consents_.

  

(a)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to sell, transfer, convey,
assign or deliver any Purchased Asset to the extent that an attempted sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance, assignment or delivery thereof would be
prohibited by applicable Law or would, without the Consent of any third party,
(i) constitute a breach or other contravention thereof, (ii) be ineffective,
void or voidable, unless and until such Consent is obtained, or (iii)
constitute a contravention of the Seller Privacy Policies.

  

   

 | 29| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(b)  The Parties shall cooperate in good faith and shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or deliver, or cause to be
obtained or delivered, any Consent (other than Consents of Governmental
Authorities, which shall be governed by  _Section 5.4_ ) required to sell,
assign, transfer, convey, assign or deliver to the Purchaser or either
Transferred Entity any Real Property Lease, Transferred Contract or other
Purchased Asset, so that the Purchaser and the Transferred Entities will have
good and valid title to (or good and valid leasehold interests in, as
applicable) the Purchased Assets and be responsible for the Assumed
Liabilities; _provided_ that none of the Seller, the Purchaser or any of their
respective Affiliates shall be required to incur any non- _de minimis_ out-
of-pocket costs in connection with identifying, obtaining or delivering
any such Consent. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Purchaser agrees to
provide such reasonable assurances as to its and its Affiliates' financial
capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be reasonably requested by
any Person whose Consent is sought hereunder upon receipt of an executed
confidentiality agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Purchaser from such Person. If such Consent is not obtained prior to the
Closing, then (i) the Seller shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
provide, until the earlier of (A) such time that such Consent or Consents are
obtained or delivered and (B) one (1) year after the Closing Date, the
Purchaser and the Transferred Entities, to the fullest extent possible, the
economic and other claims, rights and benefits of any such Purchased Assets
and (ii) the Purchaser and the Transferred Entities shall bear all Assumed
Liabilities thereunder from and after the Closing Date in accordance with
this Agreement (including any costs or Liabilities of the Seller incurred
pursuant to any Contract in respect of the reimbursement of costs and expenses
of any third party in connection with such third party's review, negotiation
or response to a request for any Consent); _provided_ that the Seller shall
not be required to provide any services that would violate any Law or result
in the disclosure of confidential information of the Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than confidential information to the extent relating to the
Business or the Purchased Assets); and _provided_ , _further_ , that, in each
case, the Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements
to provide such services under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply. The Seller agrees that prior to obtaining such
Consent with respect to any Real Property Lease, Transferred Contract or
Purchased Asset, (i) the Seller will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not
to, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, amend, modify,
terminate, or waive any of their respective rights or accelerate any of their
respective obligations under, any such Real Property Lease, Transferred
Contract or Purchased Asset and (ii) the Seller will, and will cause its
Subsidiaries to, exercise and enforce all rights and pursue all remedies in
respect thereof on behalf of and at the direction or request of (and at the
sole cost of) the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, in the case of each of
clauses (i) and (ii), except to the extent required by or prohibited by
applicable Law.

  

(c)  Subject in all respects to the other provisions of this
_Section 2.8_ , for such time from and after the Closing as the Seller holds
any Purchased Assets and provides the Purchaser any claims, rights and
benefits of any such Purchased Asset in accordance with this _Section 2.8_ ,
the Purchaser shall indemnify and hold the Seller harmless from and against
any and all Losses incurred or asserted to the extent resulting from the
Seller's post-Closing direct or indirect ownership, management or operation
of any such Purchased Assets in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice in connection with any arrangement described above in this
_Section 2.8_ (only to the extent that such Losses relate to or arise out of
the Business).

  

Section 2.9   _Shared Contracts; Specified Transform Contracts_.

  

   

 | 30| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(a)  Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date,
with respect to each Transferred Contract that is not exclusively related to
the Business (a " _Shared Contract_ "), the Seller and the Purchaser shall
reasonably cooperate and negotiate in good faith with each other and any
counterparty to such Shared Contract to agree to such amendments, assignments,
partial assignments, consents or other instruments as are reasonably
requested and desired to enable the continued use by each of the Seller and
the Purchaser and their respective Subsidiaries following the Closing of the
products or services provided under such Shared Contract, the equitable
apportionment between the Seller and the Purchaser of all rights and
obligations thereunder, including any prepaid expenses, credits, deposits and
advance payments in respect of such Shared Contract, and the several (and not
joint) liability of the Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the
Purchaser and its Affiliates, on the other hand, for any obligations or
breaches under such Shared Contract (including with respect to any rights of
the counterparty thereunder such that a breach of such Shared Contract by the
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries shall not give rise to any right or remedy
(including any right of termination or acceleration) of the counterparty or
its Affiliates thereunder against the Business, the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates and a breach of such Shared Contract by the Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries shall not give rise to any right or remedy (including any right
of termination or acceleration) of the counterparty or its Affiliates
thereunder against the Retained Business, the Seller or any of its
Affiliates). If, on the Closing Date, any such amendment, assignment, partial
assignment, consent or other instrument has not been obtained with respect to
any Shared Contract, such Shared Contract shall not be assigned to the
Purchaser and the Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate in a mutually
acceptable arrangement under which the Seller or the Purchaser, as
applicable, shall, in compliance with applicable Law, obtain the appropriate
benefits and assume the related obligations and bear the related economic
burdens in respect of such Shared Contract, including by means of
subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangements, or enforcement by
the party to such Shared Contract for the benefit (and at the expense) of the
other party that is an intended beneficiary thereof. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates bear any
costs, payments, fees or Liabilities under any Shared Contract to the extent
that such costs, payments, fees or Liabilities do not relate to or arise out
of the Business, and in no event shall the Seller or any of its Affiliates
bear any costs, payments, fees or Liabilities under any Shared Contract to
the extent that such costs, payments, fees or Liabilities relate to or arise
out of the Business. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, to the extent there is any conflict between this _Section 2.9_ and
the Consent Agreement with respect to any Transform Contract that is a Shared
Contract, the Consent Agreement shall govern with respect to such conflict.
The Seller agrees (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to agree) to the
treatment of each Transform Contract as provided in the Consent Agreement,
including any assignment and assumption of its or any of its Subsidiaries'
(other than the Transferred Entities') rights and obligations relating to the
Business under such Transform Contract to or by, as applicable, the
Purchaser, one or more of its newly formed Subsidiaries or one or more of the
Transferred Entities, in each case, in accordance with all terms and
conditions set forth in the Consent Agreement. The Seller shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, take all actions and execute and deliver such
agreements, documents or other instruments necessary or appropriate to
effectuate such treatment of the Transform Contracts as provided in the
Consent Agreement.

  

   

 | 31| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(b)  The Purchaser acknowledges that, with respect to each
Specified Transform Contract, upon the request of Transform, the Seller and
Transform shall amend such Specified Transform Contract effective as of the
Closing to include (i) rights of Transform to receive reasonable samples of
licensed materials with reasonable prior written notice to the Purchaser, to
suspend non-compliant uses of the licensed marks thirty (30) days after
notice is provided to the Purchaser or immediately if such non-compliant
use may reasonably cause material detriment to the licensed marks or the
goodwill therein and to terminate the license sixty (60) days after notice is
provided to the Purchaser of its material non-compliant use of the licensed
marks to the extent such non-compliant use has not been cured, and (ii) with
respect to the Trademark License Agreement, limit the scope of the license
granted therein to the promotion of the Business and use of the SEARS mark in
the "Sears Outlet Stores, L.L.C." corporate name or, subject to the approval
of Transform (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
another corporate name containing "Sears Outlet". For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this _Section 2.9_ shall prevent Transform from terminating any
Specified Transform Contract in accordance with its terms.

  

Section 2.10   _Reimbursement of Employee Costs Amount_. Following the
Closing, if the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the consummation of
the Merger (as defined therein), the Seller shall, substantially concurrently
with the termination of the Merger Agreement, pay to the Purchaser the
Employee Costs Amount less the portion of the AIP Retention Bonus Amounts
actually paid to Transferred Employees that was included in the Employee
Costs Amount, and the Purchaser shall promptly pay to each
Transferred Employee the portion of the Executive Employee Cost or
Transferred Employee Cost (as applicable, but in each case excluding
the employer portion of any payroll Taxes due in connection with such
payments) corresponding to the amount (if any) that would have been paid to
such Transferred Employee pursuant to Section 2.05(d) of the Merger Agreement
had the Merger been consummated on the Closing Date less the portion of the
AIP Retention Bonus Amounts actually paid to Transferred Employees that was
included in the Employee Costs Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, no portion
of the Employee Costs Amount that is paid to the Purchaser pursuant to this
Section 2.10 shall reduce the calculation of the Employee Costs Amount for
purposes of any adjustment of the Closing Payment made pursuant to _Section
2.6_.

  

Section 2.11   _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required under Law to be deducted and withheld with respect
to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Purchaser.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver written notice to the Seller, no later than
fifteen (15) Business Days prior to any payment pursuant to this Agreement
giving rise to such withholding, describing any amounts required to be
withheld from such payment. The Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide withholding tax exemption documentation with respect
thereto no later than five (5) Business Days prior to such payment.

  

Article III 
 Representations and Warranties of the Seller

  

The Seller hereby represents and warrants to the Purchaser, except as set

existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has
all necessary corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements, to carry out its obligations hereunder and
thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
The Seller is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the properties owned or leased by it
or the operation of its business makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except to the extent that the failure to be so licensed, qualified
or in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by the Seller,
the performance by the Seller of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and
the consummation by the Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite action on the part of the
Seller. This Agreement has been, and upon their execution the Ancillary
Agreements will have been, duly executed and delivered by the Seller, and
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Purchaser and
Parent) this Agreement constitutes, and upon their execution the Ancillary
Agreements will constitute, legal, valid and binding obligations of the
Seller, enforceable against the Seller in accordance with their respective
terms, except as limited by general equitable principles and
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws
of general application affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

  

(b)  Each of the Transferred Entities is a limited liability
company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of the State of Delaware, has all necessary organizational power and authority
to own, lease or otherwise hold and operate its properties and other assets
and to carry on its business as presently conducted. Each Transferred Entity
is duly qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the properties owned or leased by it or the
operation of its business makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not
have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

Section 3.2   _Ownership of Equity Interests; Capitalization_.

  

(a)  The Equity Interests are owned of record and beneficially
by the Seller free and clear of all Liens (other than Liens imposed by
applicable securities Laws and Liens securing obligations arising under the
Credit Agreements in accordance with the terms thereof that will be released
in full at the Closing). All of the Equity Interests are validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and were not issued in violation of any preemptive
rights, rights of first refusal, rights of first offer or other similar
rights. Except for the Equity Interests, there are no authorized, issued or
outstanding (i) Equity Securities of the Transferred Entities or (ii)
options, warrants, purchase rights, subscription rights, preemptive rights,
conversion rights, exchange rights, calls, puts, rights of first refusal,
rights of first offer, registration rights or other Contracts, rights,
commitments or other arrangements that require the Seller or any Transferred
Entity to issue, sell, dispose of or otherwise cause to become issued or
outstanding or to acquire, repurchase or redeem or vote any Equity Securities
of any Transferred Entity. There are no Contracts or understandings in
effect, and neither the Seller nor any Transferred Entity is bound by any
Contracts in respect of, or the voting or transfer of any of, the Equity
Securities of the Transferred Entities.

  

   

 | 33| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(b)  No Transferred Entity owns, directly or indirectly, any
equity securities of, or other ownership interest in, any Person.

  

Section 3.3   _No Conflict_. Assuming that all filings and
notifications described in _Section 3.4_ have been made, the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by the
Seller and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby do not and will not (a) violate, conflict with or result in the breach
of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Seller, (b) conflict
with or violate any Law or Governmental Order applicable to the Seller, any
of its Subsidiaries or the Purchased Assets, (c) conflict with, result in any
breach or violation of, constitute a default (or event which with the giving
of notice or lapse of time, or both, would become a default) under, require
any Consent under, or give to others any rights of termination, acceleration,
amendment or cancellation of, any Contract (including any Real
Property Lease) to which the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
(other than any Contract that is agreed to be a Transferred Contract pursuant
to clause (C) of the definition of Transferred Contracts), or (d) result in
the creation of any Lien on any of the Purchased Assets or the Equity
Interests pursuant to a Contract to which the Seller or one of its
Subsidiaries is a party, except in the case of clauses (b), (c) and (d), as
would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Except for any consents, approvals
or notices that are expressly required pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement or that would not reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impair or delay the consummation by the Seller of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, no consent or
approval of, or notice to, Transform or any other ESL Person, is required to
be obtained or provided, as applicable, in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, the performance by the
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries of its obligations hereunder or thereunder
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The
Seller has made available to the Purchaser a correct and complete copy of the
Letter Agreement, and the Letter Agreement is in full force and effect and
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller and, to the
Knowledge of Seller, Transform, except, in each case, as limited by general
equitable principles and applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws of general application affecting enforcement of
creditors' rights generally.

  

Section 3.4   _Governmental Consents and Approvals_. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement by
the Seller do not and will not require any Consent of any Governmental
Authority, except (a) the filing of the Information Statement with the SEC or
(b) where failure to obtain such Consent would not, individually or in the
aggregate with all such Consents, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impair or delay the consummation by the Seller of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or would not
reasonably be expected to be material to the Business.

  

Section 3.5   _Financial Information_.

  

   

 | 34| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(a)   _Section 3.5(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule contains true

cash flows and stockholders' equity of the Seller and its Subsidiaries for the
fiscal years ended as of such dates, and the audited summary of segment data
for the Seller's Sears Outlet reporting segment (the " _Outlet Segment_ ")
for the fiscal years ended as of January 28, 2017, February 3, 2018 and
February 2, 2019 (collectively, the " _Audited Financial Statements_ "), (ii)
the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Seller and its
Subsidiaries as of May 4, 2019, the related unaudited consolidated statements
of operations, cash flows and stockholders' equity of the Seller and its

(iii) the unaudited balance sheet of the Business as of May 4, 2019 (the "
_Interim Financial Statements_ " and, together with the Audited Financial
Statements and the 10-Q Financial Statements, the " _Financial Statements_ ").
The Financial Statements (A) were prepared from and in accordance with the
books of account and other financial records of the Seller and
its Subsidiaries (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), (B) in
the case of the Audited Financial Statements and the 10-Q Financial
Statements only, comply in all material respects with the rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and present fairly in all
material respects (x) the consolidated financial condition and the
consolidated results of operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders'
equity of the Seller and its Subsidiaries and (y) the results of operations of
the Outlet Segment, in each case, as of the dates thereof or for the periods
covered thereby, (C) were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied throughout the periods indicated (except as indicated in the related

regulations of the SEC and, in the case of the Interim Financials only, the
absence of notes and (y) the Interim Financial Statements are presented on a
carve-out basis to include the historical financial position of the Business
on a standalone basis, and any and all allocations made with respect to assets
and liabilities not solely related to the Business are made on a reasonable
basis.

  

(b)  The books and records of the Seller and its Subsidiaries
have been maintained in material compliance with applicable legal and
accounting requirements (including GAAP), and such records accurately reflect,
in all material respects, all transactions in respect of the conduct of the
Business.

  

(c)  The Seller and its Subsidiaries maintain a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
that, with respect to the Business, (i) transactions are executed in
accordance with the board of directors' or board of managers' (or equivalent
governing body's) general or specific authorization, (ii) transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP (except as otherwise provided in _Section 3.5(a)_ ),

assets at reasonable intervals so that appropriate action can be taken with
respect to any differences, and (iv) the obligations of the Seller and its
Subsidiaries are satisfied in a timely manner and as required under the terms
of any applicable Contract. Such internal accounting controls
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Seller's and
its Subsidiaries' financial reporting (including as required by Rule 13a-15
under the Exchange Act) and the preparation of Seller's and its Subsidiaries'
consolidated financial statements with respect to the Business for external

deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect the Seller's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (B) any known fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Seller's and its Subsidiaries' internal controls and
the Seller has made available to the Purchaser copies of any such disclosure.

(d)  All outstanding accounts receivable, bills receivable and
trade accounts of the Seller and its Subsidiaries relating to the Business
have resulted from bona fide arm's-length transactions in the ordinary course
of business. Except as set forth on _Section 3.5(d)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, no defense, set-off or counterclaim has been asserted since
February 2, 2019 with respect to any such receivable and no such receivable
is past due more than ninety (90) days.

  

(e)   _Section 3.5(e)(i)_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a list of any and all Contracts pursuant to which guarantees (including of
performance under Contracts included in the Purchased Assets, letters of
credit or other credit arrangements, including surety and performance bonds)
were issued by, or for the account of, the Seller and/or any of its
Subsidiaries to support or facilitate transactions or obligations of the
Business (collectively, the " _Credit Support Arrangements_ ") and the amount
of each Credit Support Arrangement. _Section 3.5(e)(ii)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a list of any and all Contracts pursuant to which

Entities) or to support or facilitate transactions or obligations of the
businesses of the Seller and/or its Subsidiaries (other than the Business and
the Transferred Entities) and the amount of each such arrangement.

  

Section 3.6   _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. There are no
material Liabilities of the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries related to the
Business, other than Liabilities (a) reflected in or reserved against on the
Interim Financial Statements or the balance sheet set forth in the 10-Q
Financial Statements or the notes thereto or (b) incurred since May 4, 2019,
in the ordinary course of business that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not been and would not reasonably be expected to be material to the
Business (excluding any such liabilities resulting or arising from a breach or
violation of any Contract, warranty or applicable Law or tort or
infringement). The Seller and its Subsidiaries do not maintain any "off
balance sheet arrangements" within the meaning of Item 303 of Regulation S-K
of the SEC.

  

Section 3.7   _Conduct in the Ordinary Course_. Since February 3,
2019, (a) the Seller and its Subsidiaries (i) have conducted the Business in
the ordinary course and (ii) have not taken any action or omitted to take any
action which if taken or omitted to be taken after the date hereof would
constitute a violation of _Section 5.1(b)_ or _Section 5.1(c)_ , and (b)
there has not occurred any Material Adverse Effect.

  

Section 3.8   _Litigation; Governmental Orders_. There is no Action
by or against the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries pending, or to the
Seller's Knowledge, threatened, by or before any Governmental Authority that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to (a) prevent
or materially impair or delay the consummation by the Seller of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, (b)

Section 3.11   _Real Property_.

  

(a)   _Section 3.11(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true, correct and complete list of all leases, subleases, licenses,
sublicenses and other occupancy agreements, together with any amendments,
modifications, supplements and guarantees relating thereto, under which the
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries leases, subleases, licenses, uses or
otherwise occupies any real property primarily held for use by the Business,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Headquarters Lease (each, a "
_Leased Real Property_ ," and such leases, subleases, licenses, sublicenses
and occupancy agreements, together with any amendments, modifications,
supplements and guarantees relating thereto, the " _Real Property Leases_ ").

  

(b)  The Seller or one of its Subsidiaries has a valid
leasehold, subleasehold, license or similar interest in each Leased Real
Property, free and clear of all Liens except for Permitted Liens. No Real
Property Lease is subject to any material defenses, setoffs or counterclaims,
and no material obligations of any landlords or sublandlords thereunder are
delinquent. Either the Seller or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, has
performed all material obligations required to be performed by it to date
under each Real Property Lease. With respect to each Leased Real Property,

Real Property or any material portion thereof. Neither the Seller nor any of

any material default under any Real Property Lease, which default
remains uncured, has been sent or received by the Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries. To the Seller's Knowledge, no conditions or circumstances exist
which, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both, would
constitute a material default or breach under any Real Property Lease. Each
Real Property Lease is in full force and effect, and is the valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of the Seller or one of its Subsidiaries in accordance
with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or
affecting creditors' rights generally and general equitable principles
(whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). To the Seller's
Knowledge, no portion of the Leased Real Property is subject to any pending
condemnation or eminent domain proceeding by any Governmental Authority and

thereto.

(c)  All improvements located on the Leased Real Property and
the Owned Real Property (as defined below) are in sufficiently good condition
and repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted) to allow the Business to be
operated in all material respects in the ordinary course of business as
currently operated and as presently proposed to be operated. To the Seller's
Knowledge, no fact or condition exists which could result in the termination
or reduction (other than to a _de minimis_ extent) of the current access from
the Leased Real Property or the Owned Real Property to existing roads or to
sewer or other utility services presently serving such Leased Real Property
and the Owned Real Property that would materially impact the use of the Leased
Real Property or the Owned Real Property, as applicable. Each Owned Real
Property and Leased Real Property is suitable for its current use, and no
other real property is being used or is otherwise reasonably required to
operate the Business as currently conducted. The Seller or one of its
Subsidiaries has exclusive possession of each parcel of Owned Real Property
and Leased Real Property, other than any occupancy rights granted to third-
party owners, tenants or licensees pursuant to agreements with respect to such
real property entered in the ordinary course of business and set forth on
_Section 3.11(a)_ or _Section 3.11(d)_ of the Disclosure Schedule. There are
no third party contracts in effect to which any of the Seller or its
Subsidiaries is a party for the performance any material repairs, work,
and/or capital improvements at any Owned Real Property or Leased Real
Property, and there is currently no ongoing construction work in, on, or
about any Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property other than normal,
immaterial maintenance and repairs being performed in the ordinary course of
business. There are no leasing commissions due from the Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property.

  

(d)   _Section 3.11(d)_ of the Disclosure Schedule list all real
property owned by the Seller or one of its Subsidiaries and held for use by
the Business (collectively, the " _Owned Real Property_ "). The Seller or one
of its Subsidiaries has valid title to the Owned Real Property, free and
clear of all Liens except for Permitted Liens. The Seller or one of its
Subsidiaries has exclusive possession of each parcel of Owned Real Property,
other than any occupancy rights granted to third-party owners, tenants or
licensees pursuant to agreements with respect to such real property entered in
the ordinary course of business. No portion of the Owned Real Property is
subject to any pending condemnation or eminent domain proceeding by any
Governmental Authority and, to the Seller's Knowledge, there is no threatened
condemnation or eminent domain action with respect thereto. There are
no options, first refusal, first offer or first opportunity rights or other
similar rights with respect to any portion of the Owned Real Property. There
are no tax reduction proceedings pending with respect to all or any portion of
the Owned Real Property. To the Seller's Knowledge, except as would not have
a Material Adverse Effect, (i) there is no existing breach or default by any
party under any easements or restrictive covenants affecting the Owned Real
Property which breach or default has not yet been cured, (ii) neither the
Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of any default
under any easements or restrictive covenants affecting the Owned Real
Property which default has not yet been cured, and (iii) there does not exist
any condition or event that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice,
or both, would constitute such a breach or default under any easements or
restrictive covenants affecting the Owned Real Property.

except for Permitted Liens, other than tangible personal property sold or

moving items. The quantities of each item included in the Purchased Inventory
are not excessive and are reasonable, in each case, in the circumstances of
the Business.

whether directly or indirectly, Title IV of ERISA, including any Multiemployer
Plan, or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code or a

under ERISA or the Code. Each Employee Plan has been established, maintained
and funded at all times in compliance with its terms and, in all material
respects, with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, orders,
rules and regulations, including ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to

determination or opinion letter on which the Seller can rely that it is so
qualified and that its trust is exempt from Tax under Section 501(a) of the
Code, or has pending or has time remaining in which to file, an application
for such determination from the Internal Revenue Service, and, to the
Knowledge of the Seller, there is no reason to expect that any such
determination letter would be revoked and nothing has occurred with respect
to the operation of any such plan which could reasonably be expected to cause
the loss of such qualification or exemption or the imposition of any material
Liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code.

(e)  Except as set forth in _Section 3.18(e)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule or as expressly provided in this Agreement, the consummation of the

with any other event) (i) entitle any Business Employee to any payment or
benefit, including any bonus, retention, severance, retirement or job
security payment or benefit or (ii) with respect to any Business Employee,
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, or

(f)  The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and/or the Merger Agreement (either alone or together with any
other event) will not result in the payment or benefit (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property) by the Purchaser or any of its

date or event;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such list shall (i) be based on

are in full force and effect and are the legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Purchaser (in the case of the Debt Commitment Letters), Parent (in
the case of the Equity Commitment) and, to the Purchaser's Knowledge, the
other parties thereto, enforceable against such parties in accordance with
their terms, except as limited by general equitable principles and applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general
application affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally. As of the
date of this Agreement, the obligations of the Lenders and the Investor, as
applicable, to fund the commitments under the Financing Commitments are not
subject to any conditions other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Commitments. Except as previously disclosed to the Seller, as of the date of

arrangements or other Contracts relating to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the full amount of the Acquisition Financing other than as
expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments furnished to the Seller
pursuant to _Section 4.4(a)_. As of the date of this Agreement, to the
Purchaser's Knowledge, no event has occurred that (with or without notice,
lapse of time, or both) would constitute a breach or default under the
Financing Commitments by the Purchaser or Parent. As of the date of this
Agreement, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section
7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ of this Agreement, to the Purchaser's Knowledge, there

of the conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments not being satisfied
or (ii) the Acquisition Financing not being made available to the Purchaser on
a timely basis in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, (A) none of the Financing
Commitments have been amended or modified and (B) the respective commitments
contained in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn, modified or
rescinded in any respect. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of all or
any part of the Acquisition Financing is not a condition to Closing or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
irrespective and independently of the availability of the Acquisition
Financing, the Purchaser shall be obligated to pay the Purchase Price and meet
all its financial obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Article VII_.

  

  

Section 4.5   _Solvency_. The Purchaser is not entering into this
Agreement, and the Purchaser and Parent (as applicable) are not entering into
the Financing Commitments, with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either
present or future creditors. Immediately after giving effect to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Acquisition Financing pursuant to the Financing Commitments and the payment
of the Closing Payment and the payment of the fees and expenses of the
Purchaser and its Affiliates incurred in connection with the Closing, and
assuming that (i) the representations and warranties made by the Seller
herein are true and correct, (ii) the Seller has complied in all material
respects with its covenants and other agreements hereunder and (iii) the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ have been satisfied:

saleable value (determined on a going concern basis) greater than the total
amount required to pay its debts (including a reasonable estimate of the
amount of all contingent Liabilities);

  

(b)  the Purchaser will be able to pay its debts and obligations
in the ordinary course of business as they become due; and

  

(c)  the Purchaser will have adequate capital to carry on its
business as currently conducted.

  

Section 4.6   _Litigation_. There is no Action by or against the
Purchaser pending, or to the Purchaser's Knowledge, threatened, by or before
any Governmental Authority that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to (a) prevent or materially impair or delay the
consummation by the Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or (b) affect the legality, validity or
enforceability of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

  

Section 4.7   _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker is
entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Purchaser.

  

Section 4.8   _Purchaser Disclosure Documents_. Each document
required to be filed by the Purchaser with the SEC in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any amendments or supplements
thereto, will, when filed, distributed or disseminated, as applicable, (a)
comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and applicable state Law and (b) assuming that any information
supplied by the Seller or its Subsidiaries for inclusion therein does not or
will not, as applicable, contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not false or misleading, not contain any untrue
statement of material fact, or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances in which they were made, not false or misleading.

  

Section 4.9   _Independent Investigation; No Other Representations
and Warranties_.

  

(a)  The Purchaser has conducted its own independent
investigation, review and analysis of, and reached its own
independent conclusions regarding, the Business and its operations, assets,
condition (financial or otherwise) and prospects. The Purchaser and its
Representatives have been provided with access to the personnel, properties,
premises, records and other documents and information of and relating to the
Business for such purpose. The Purchaser has been represented by, and had the
assistance of, counsel in the conduct of its due diligence, the preparation
and negotiation of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. In entering
into this Agreement, the Purchaser acknowledges that it has relied solely
upon its own investigation, review and analysis and has not relied on and is
not relying on any representation, warranty or other statement made by, on
behalf of or relating to the Seller, the Seller's Representatives or the
Business except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in
_Article III_ (and, with respect to such representations and warranties,
subject to any limitations expressly set forth in this Agreement and as such
representations and warranties may be qualified by the Disclosure Schedule)
and in any Ancillary Agreement.

and warranties may be qualified by the Disclosure Schedule) and the

Closing or, if shorter, the applicable period specified in the Seller's
document retention policy, the Seller shall (i) retain the books and records
relating to the portion of the Business conducted by it relating to periods
prior to the Closing which shall not otherwise have been delivered to the
Purchaser and (ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the Representatives of the
Purchaser reasonable access (including the right to make, at the Purchaser's
sole expense, photocopies), during normal business hours under the
supervision of the Seller's personnel and in a manner that minimizes
disruption of the normal operations of the Purchaser's business, to such
books and records; _provided_ that the Seller shall notify the Purchaser at
least forty-five (45) days in advance of destroying any such books and
records prior to the seventh anniversary of the Closing in order to provide
the Purchaser the opportunity to copy such books and records, at the
Purchaser's sole expense, in accordance with this _Section 5.2(c)_ ; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that any Tax information shall be provided on a pro
forma basis (solely with respect to the Business). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
disclose any information to the Purchaser or its Representatives if such
disclosure would, as reasonably determined by the Seller's counsel, (A)
waive any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (B) contravene any
applicable Laws or any binding agreement with a third party not entered into
for the purposes of frustrating the rights granted to the Purchaser under this
_Section 5.2(c)_ ; _provided_ , that, in each case, the Seller shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, use commercially reasonable efforts to

the preceding sentence apply.

  

(d)  No investigation or access pursuant to this _Section 5.2_
or information provided, made available or delivered pursuant to this

warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement or the conditions

the Purchaser under this _Section 5.3_ shall terminate only in respect of
that portion of the Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement)
relating to the Business or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and all other terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms. If this Agreement is, for any
reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect.

---|---|--- 

 



    

(b)  Nothing provided to the Purchaser pursuant to _Section
5.2(a)_ shall in any way amend or diminish the Purchaser's obligations under
the Confidentiality Agreement. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that any
information provided to the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 5.2(a)_ or
otherwise by the Seller or any of its Representatives shall be treated as
Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) under, and shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of, the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

(c)  From and after the Closing until the date that is two (2)
years after the Closing Date, the Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to, keep confidential

or otherwise obtained by the Seller or any of its Affiliates prior to the
Closing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Seller shall not be liable
hereunder with respect to any disclosure of any such information to the
extent such disclosure is reasonably determined by the Seller (with the
advice of counsel) to be required by any applicable Law or
Governmental Order, including applicable rules of any securities exchange on
which the Seller's securities are traded. In the event that the Seller or any
of its Affiliates or its or their Representatives intend to disclose any such
non-public information pursuant to the exception noted in the proviso above,
the Seller shall, (i) to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
practicable under the circumstances, provide the Purchaser with prompt
written notice of such intended disclosure, and (ii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of such non-public
information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such non-public information shall
not include information that (A) is or becomes generally available to the
public after the Closing other than as a result of a disclosure by the Seller
or any of its Affiliates or its or their respective Representatives in breach
of this _Section 5.3(c)_ or (B) becomes available to the Seller or any of its
Affiliates or its or their respective Representatives after the Closing from
a source other than the Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or its or their
respective Representatives if the source of such information is not known,
after reasonably inquiry under the circumstances, by the Seller or its
Affiliates or its or their respective Representatives to be bound by a
confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or professional
obligation or duty of confidentiality to, the Purchaser or its Affiliates or
any Vintage Person with respect to such information.

with the other Party in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations,
consents, orders and approvals.

(b)  Without limiting the generality of the Purchaser's
undertaking pursuant to _Section 5.4(a)_ , the Purchaser agrees to use, and
to cause its Affiliates to use, reasonable best efforts and to take any and
all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
Regulatory Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority so as to
enable the parties hereto to expeditiously close the transactions
contemplated hereby no later than the Outside Date, including (i) selling or
otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise
dispose of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of the Business or the
Purchaser or its Affiliates, (ii) terminating existing relationships,
contractual rights or obligations of the Business or the Purchaser or its
Affiliates, (iii) terminating any venture or other arrangement, (iv) creating
any relationship, contractual rights or obligations of the Business or the

action in clauses (i) through (v), a " _Remedy Action_ ") (and, in each case,
to enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or
file appropriate applications with any Governmental Authority in connection
with any of the foregoing; _provided_ that any such Remedy Action may be
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing) in order to avoid the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining
order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the
effect of materially delaying or preventing the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the Purchaser shall not be obligated to (or be obligated to cause any
of its Affiliates to) take any Remedy Action that would, or would be
reasonably likely to, result in a Material Adverse Effect or a material
adverse effect on the business, assets, operations or financial condition of
the Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, after giving effect to the
Closing, the Transferred Entities), taken as a whole.

  

(c)  Each Party shall promptly notify the other Parties of any
communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and
permit the other Parties to review in advance, and consider in good faith the
view of the other Parties regarding, any proposed communication by such Party
to any Governmental Authority. No Party shall agree to participate in any
meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other
Parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate
at such meeting or discussion. Subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Parties shall coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in

impact the ability of the Purchaser or Parent (as applicable) to enforce its
rights against other parties to the Financing Commitments or to draw upon and

Seller, the Purchaser shall keep the Seller informed on a reasonably
current basis and in reasonable detail with respect to all material activity
concerning the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser shall notify the

to any Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the
Acquisition Financing of any provisions of the Financing Commitments or any
definitive document related to the Acquisition Financing or (III) of the
occurrence of an event or development that could reasonably be expected to
adversely impact the ability of the Purchaser or Parent (as applicable) to

reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources on terms and conditions no less favorable, in the

letter with respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (the " _New Debt

For the avoidance of doubt, the licenses granted in _Section 5.11(e)_ and
_Section 5.11(f)_ will survive a change of control of the Seller, following
which the successor of the Seller will be deemed "the Seller" for all
purposes.

  

(h)  To the extent permissible under applicable Law, no Party
shall challenge the validity, enforceability, registrability or ownership of
the Trademarks licensed to such Party by any other Party under this Agreement.

  

(i)  The licenses granted in this _Section 5.11_ are, and
shall otherwise be deemed to be, for the purposes of Section 365(n) of the
United States Bankruptcy Code (the " _Bankruptcy Code_ "), licenses to rights
in "intellectual property" as defined under the Bankruptcy Code. As licensees
of such rights under this Agreement, each Party and its
respective Subsidiaries shall retain and may fully exercise all of their
rights and elections under the Bankruptcy Code. Upon the commencement of
bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings by or against the licensor party under
the Bankruptcy Code, (i) each Party and its respective Subsidiaries shall be
entitled to retain all of their rights under this _Section 5.11 and (ii)_ for
the avoidance of doubt, if such licensor party rejects this Agreement, the
licenses granted in this _Section 5.11_ shall not be deemed to be
automatically terminated without action by the licensee.

  

Section 5.12   _Transition Services_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Seller and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith and finalize the form
of a transition services agreement (the " _Transition Services Agreement_ ")
to be entered into at the Closing pursuant to which the Seller and its
Affiliates will provide to the Purchaser and its Affiliates, and
the Purchaser and its Affiliates will provide to the Seller and its
Affiliates, certain transition, migration and separation services mutually
agreed upon by the Seller and the Purchaser, which shall include those
services specified in _Section 5.12_ of the Disclosure Schedule and any other
services that may be requested to be received by the Purchaser or the
Seller and that were provided by the Seller or its Affiliates to the Business
or by the Business to the Seller or its Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Entities), as applicable, in the six (6) months prior to the
Closing Date. Each service under the Transition Services Agreement shall be
provided for a period of six (6) months following the Closing Date, or to the
extent a different term for such service is agreed to or is provided in
_Section 5.12_ of the Disclosure Schedule, such different term (such
term, the " _Initial Term_ "). The Initial Term in respect of such service
shall be subject to an extension for up to three (3) months by the service
recipient, which extension the service provider shall grant if, at the end of
the Initial Term, the service recipient has undertaken in good faith to
complete the transition, migration or separation of such service prior to the
end of the Initial Term but has not yet completed such transition or
migration. Either service recipient shall be entitled to terminate all or any
of the services provided to it or its Affiliates thereunder, for any reason or
for no reason, at any time upon at least thirty (30) days' prior written
notice to the service provider. The Transition Services Agreement will
provide that in consideration for the services provided under the Transition
Services Agreement, the service recipient shall pay to the service provider
(a) with respect to each service described in _Section 5.12_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, the amount provided with respect to such service, and (b) with
respect to any other requested service, the amount of such service
provider's reasonable costs incurred in providing such service (which costs
shall be determined using a methodology reasonably consistent with the
determination of the fees charged by such service provider set forth on
_Section 5.12_ of the Disclosure Schedule) or such other amount as may be
agreed to by the service provider and the service recipient.

Section 5.13   _Cash Distribution_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Seller shall cause each of the Transferred Entities to distribute to the
Seller all cash that would otherwise be held by such Transferred Entity as of
the Effective Time; _provided _ that the Seller and its Subsidiaries
(including the Transferred Entities) shall not distribute (or cause to be
distributed) any cash to the extent that it would result in the amount of
cash held in store facilities of the Business to be less than $200,000 in the
aggregate as of the Effective Time.

  

Section 5.14   _Release of Credit Support Arrangements_. Prior to the
Closing, the Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to,
effective as of the Closing, (i) obtain replacements for the Credit Support
Arrangements or (ii) arrange for itself or one of its Subsidiaries to be
substituted as the obligor for the Credit Support Arrangements and, in each
case, obtain the release of the Seller and its Subsidiaries (excluding any of
the Transferred Entities) from any such Credit Support Arrangements;
_provided_  that, to the extent any Credit Support Arrangement supports or
facilitates transactions or obligations of any portion of the
Retained Business in addition to transactions or obligations of any portion
of the Business, the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall apply only to that
portion of such Credit Support Arrangement that supports or facilitates
transactions or obligations of the Business. If the Purchaser cannot obtain
the release of the Seller and its Subsidiaries (excluding the Transferred
Entities) from any such Credit Support Arrangements effective as of or prior
to the Closing, from and after the Closing the Purchaser shall indemnify
and hold the Seller and such Subsidiaries harmless for any Losses incurred by
the Seller or such Subsidiaries with respect to such Credit Support
Arrangements to the extent that such Losses relate to the Business.

  

Section 5.15   _Information Statement_.

  

(a)  The Purchaser acknowledges that the Seller prepared and
filed with the SEC the Information Statement in preliminary form on or around
July 26, 2019. The Seller shall use reasonable best efforts as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and after consultation with the Purchaser) to respond
to any comments or requests for additional information made by the SEC with
respect to the Information Statement.

   

 | 74| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(b)  As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Information
Statement has been cleared by the SEC, the Seller shall file with the SEC the
Information Statement in definitive form as contemplated by Rule 14c-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act substantially in the form previously
cleared or filed with the SEC, as the case may be, and mail a copy of the
Information Statement to Seller's stockholders of record.

  

(c)  The Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with the Seller in
any revision of the Information Statement relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) the Purchaser will furnish to the Seller the information
relating to it and its Affiliates (for this purpose, including any Vintage
Person) to the extent required by the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Information
Statement, that is customarily included in information statements prepared in
connection with transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement or
that is reasonably requested by the Seller, and (ii) prior to the filing with
the SEC or the mailing to the stockholders of the Seller of the Information
Statement, the Seller shall provide the Purchaser with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on, and the Seller shall reasonably
consider all comments reasonably proposed by the Purchaser with respect to,
portions of the Information Statement relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Seller shall promptly (A) notify the
Purchaser upon the receipt of any comments or requests from the SEC and its
staff related to the Information Statement and (B) provide the Purchaser with
copies of all correspondence between the Seller and its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand, to the extent
such correspondence relates to the Information Statement and this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

Section 5.16   _Insurance Matters_.

  

(a)  From and after the Closing, the Transferred Entities and
the Business shall cease to be insured by the insurance policies of Seller
and its Subsidiaries for claims occurring on or after the Closing. With
respect to occurrences, acts, omissions, claims, or circumstances prior to
the Closing relating to the Business or the employees and former employees of
the Business that are covered by the Seller's and its Subsidiaries'
occurrence-based insurance policies (the " _Retained Seller Insurance
Policies_ "), following the Closing, the Purchaser may submit to Seller and
Seller shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to), on behalf of the
Business, make claims under such Retained Seller Insurance Policies subject to
the terms and conditions of such Retained Seller Insurance Policies and pay
to the Purchaser the amounts received by the Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries in respect of such claims under such Retained Seller
Insurance Policies, to the extent such coverage and limits are available
under such policies and programs; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser
shall indemnify the Seller and its Subsidiaries for, and pay to them the
amount of any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses or
other Losses (including any increased insurance premiums) incurred by the
Seller and its Subsidiaries in connection with or as a result of the making
of any such claims. Nothing in this _Section 5.16(a)_ shall require the Seller
to continue any Retained Seller Insurance Policy or prevent the Seller from
amending the terms of or terminating any such Retained Seller Insurance
Policy.

  

   

 | 75| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(b)  Prior to, but effective upon, the consummation of the
Merger, the Seller shall purchase, and maintain in effect for a period of six
(6) years thereafter, the DandO Insurance.

  

Section 5.17   _Exclusive Dealing_. From the date hereof until the
earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, the Seller shall not, and it shall cause its Subsidiaries and
its and their respective Representatives and Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly: (a) solicit, initiate, or knowingly facilitate or actively
encourage the submission of, or any inquiries with respect to, any
Acquisition Proposal; (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person, information with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal; or (c) enter into any agreement with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal. The Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and its and their respective Representatives and Affiliates to, immediately
terminate all discussions with Persons other than the Purchaser and its
Affiliates concerning any Acquisition Proposal, including terminating access
to any electronic or other data room maintained in connection with a potential
strategic transaction regarding the Business. Any breach of this _Section
5.17_ by Representatives or Affiliates of the Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries will be deemed a breach by the Seller.

  

Section 5.18   _Financial Information_. From and after the date hereof
(including after the Closing), the Seller shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to prepare and deliver to the Purchaser and its
Representatives such financial information regarding the Business and the
historical performance thereof as the Purchaser may reasonably request,
including such financial information as the Purchaser may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation by the Purchaser of (a) pro forma
financial statements that reflect the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and (b) any financial statements (including audited
financial statements) in respect of the Business that the Purchaser may
require to comply with federal securities Laws, including Rule 3-05 and Rule
8-02 of Regulation S-X; _provided _ that, from and after the Closing Date,
the Seller shall not be obligated to prepare any new financial information
that cannot be prepared by the Seller without the expenditure by the Seller
of a material amount of time and effort. The Purchaser shall reimburse the
Seller or any Subsidiary thereof for any costs incurred in preparing such
information (which costs shall be determined using a methodology reasonably
consistent with the determination of the fees charged by the Seller set forth
on _Section 5.12_  of the Disclosure Schedule).

  

  

Section 5.19   _Certain Covenants_. From and after the date hereof
until the Closing, the Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, as applicable, (a) enforce its rights and the obligations of Transform and
its Affiliates (as applicable) under, the Merger Agreement, the Letter
Agreement and any other agreements entered into in connection with the Merger
Agreement or the Letter Agreement by the Seller and its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and Transform and its Affiliates, on the other hand, in each case,
to the extent relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements, and (b) not amend, modify or waive any provision of
the Merger Agreement, the Letter Agreement or any other agreements entered
into in connection therewith in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. If the Closing
would not reasonably be likely to occur prior to the Outside Date, then the
Seller agrees that if the Purchaser so elects and to the extent the Seller is
permitted to do so under the Merger Agreement and/or the Letter Agreement,
the Seller will extend the "Outlet Closing Deadline" in accordance with the
Merger Agreement and the Letter Agreement to permit the Closing to occur prior
to the Outside Date; _provided _ that his _Section 5.19_ shall not be
construed to require that the Seller seek or obtain any extension of the
Credit Agreement Default Waiver Expiration Date.

Section 5.20   _Mutual Release_.

  

(a)  Effective upon the Closing and without further action by
any Person, the Seller, on behalf of itself and each of its Subsidiaries
(other than the Transferred Entities) (each, a " _Seller Releasing Person_ "),
hereby irrevocably, unconditionally and fully waives, acquits, remises, and
forever discharges and releases each of the Purchaser, its direct
parent entity and the Transferred Entities (collectively, the " _Purchaser
Released Parties_ ") from any and all Liabilities of any kind or nature
whatsoever, in each case arising or occurring or that could have arisen or
occurred from any actions, omissions or state of facts occurring, not
occurring or in existence (whether or not known) on or prior to the Closing
and whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, known or
unknown, suspected or unsuspected, matured or unmatured or determined or
determinable, and whether arising under any Law, Contract, arrangement, or
understanding, whether written or oral (other than this Agreement and any
Ancillary Agreement) or otherwise at law or in equity (collectively, the "
_Seller Released Claims_ "), and the Seller, on behalf of itself and each
other Seller Releasing Person, covenants and agrees not to sue, assert or
otherwise seek to recover any amounts in any forum in regard to any Seller
Released Claims from any of the Purchaser Released Parties (except as
provided in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, in each case, only to
the extent set forth herein or therein). The Seller, on behalf of itself and
each other Seller Releasing Person, acknowledges and agrees that facts in
addition to or different from those which are now known or believed to be
true with respect to the subject matter of this release may hereafter be
discovered, but the Seller, on behalf of itself and each other Seller
Releasing Person, agrees to remain bound hereby and hereby fully releases all
Seller Released Claims without regard to the subsequent discovery or existence
of different or additional facts and waives the protection of any statute or
doctrine limiting a release of unknown or unsuspected Seller Released Claims.
Without limitation of the foregoing, the Seller, on behalf of itself and each
other Seller Releasing Person, hereby waives the application of any provision
of Law, including California Civil Code Section 1542, that purports to limit
the scope of a general release.

  

(b)  Effective upon the Closing and without further action by
any Person, the Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of the Transferred
Entities (each, a " _Purchaser Releasing Person_ "), hereby irrevocably,
unconditionally and fully waives, acquits, remises, and forever discharges
and releases each of the Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Transferred Entities) (collectively, the " _Seller Released Parties_ ") from
any and all Liabilities of any kind or nature whatsoever, in each case
arising or occurring or that could have arisen or occurred from any actions,
omissions or state of facts occurring, not occurring or in existence (whether
or not known) on or prior to the Closing and whether absolute or contingent,
liquidated or unliquidated, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected,
matured or unmatured or determined or determinable, and whether arising under
any Law, Contract, arrangement, or understanding, whether written or oral
(other than this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement) or otherwise at law
or in equity (collectively, the " _Purchaser Released Claims_ "), and the
Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each other Purchaser Releasing Person,
covenants and agrees not to sue, assert or otherwise seek to recover any
amounts in any forum in regard to any Purchaser Released Claims from any of
the Seller Released Parties (except as provided in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement, in each case, only to the extent set forth herein or
therein). The Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each other Purchaser
Releasing Person, acknowledges and agrees that facts in addition to or
different from those which are now known or believed to be true with respect
to the subject matter of this release may hereafter be discovered, but the
Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each other Purchaser Releasing Person,
agrees to remain bound hereby and hereby fully releases all
Purchaser Released Claims without regard to the subsequent discovery or
existence of different or additional facts and waives the protection of any
statute or doctrine limiting a release of unknown or unsuspected Purchaser
Released Claims. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Purchaser, on
behalf of itself and each other Purchaser Releasing Person, hereby waives the
application of any provision of Law, including California Civil Code Section
1542, that purports to limit the scope of a general release.

(c)  Section 1542 of the California Civil Code provides: "A
general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing
party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of
executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially
affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party."

  

(d)  For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 5.20_
constitutes, or shall be deemed to constitute, a release of any claim that
any party to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement may have hereunder or
thereunder.

  

Article VI 
 Employee Matters

  

Section 6.1   _List of Employees_. Following the date hereof and
through the Closing Date, the Seller shall regularly update the Business
Employee List to reflect changes in accordance with _Section 3.19(a)_.

  

Section 6.2   _Offer of Employment_.

  

(a)  At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing, the
Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, provide to each (i)
Offeree Employee listed in the Business Employee List, including any such
Offeree Employee on vacation or paid time off as of the Closing and excluding
Inactive Offeree Employees (as defined below) an offer of employment in
writing, or (ii) Transferred Entity Employee a written notice setting forth
the terms and conditions of such Transferred Entity Employee's continued
employment with a Transferred Entity. The Purchaser shall cause all offers of
employment and all notices of continued employment to: (x) state that the
Purchaser will assume all accrued vacation and sick leave on the Closing Date
and (y) provide compensation and benefits in accordance with _Section
6.2(c)_. In the case of offers of employment, the Purchaser shall
promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days of becoming aware
that any such employee is not accepting the Purchaser's offer of employment)
notify the Seller in writing if any such employee rejects such offer of
employment. In the case of offers of employment to the Offeree Employees set
forth on _Section 6.2(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule (such Offeree Employees,
the " _Delayed Transfer Executives_ "), the offer letter shall comply in all
respects with the requirements of this  _Section 6.2(a)_ , except, with
respect to timing, such offer shall be to commence active employment with the
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates (including a Transferred Entity) on the
earlier of (x) the date on which the closing of the Merger occurs and (y) the
date that is seven (7) Business Days following the Closing Date. As used
herein, " _Transferred Employee_ " means each (i) Transferred Entity
Employee, as well as each (ii) Offeree Employee who affirmatively accepts the
Purchaser's offer of employment pursuant to this _Section 6.2(a)_.

  

   

 | 78| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(b)  Immediately following the date on which any Offeree
Employee who is on an approved short-term disability, long-term disability
leave, workers compensation leave or other approved leave of absence (each, an
" _Inactive Offeree Employee_ ") returns to active duty and subject to
receipt of notice from the Seller at least five (5) Business Days prior to
such date, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to,
provide an offer of employment to such Inactive Offeree Employee with an
offer letter that complies in all respects with the requirements of _Section
6.2(a)_ , except with respect to timing, such offer shall be to commence
active employment with the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates (including a
Transferred Entity) within ten (10) days following such Inactive Offeree
Employee's return to active status (the date of such return, the "
_Employment Commencement Date_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser
shall be under no obligation to offer employment to any Inactive Offeree
Employee who has not returned to active employment on or prior to the date on
which such Inactive Offeree Employee is entitled to reinstatement pursuant to
applicable Law (the " _Last Reinstatement Date_ "). The Purchaser
shall reimburse the Seller for compensation costs (including the employer
portion of payroll taxes) other than any costs incurred pursuant to any
Excluded Employee Plan incurred by the Seller in respect of service provided
by any Inactive Offeree Employee during the period commencing on the Closing
Date and ending on the earlier of the Employment Commencement Date of such
Inactive Offeree Employee or the Last Reinstatement Date of such Inactive
Offeree Employee; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser shall be under
no obligation to reimburse the Seller in accordance with this sentence for any
compensation costs covered by the Seller's or any of its Affiliates'
insurance in respect of any Inactive Offeree Employee who is on an approved
long-term disability leave under any long-term disability plan or policy (it
being understood and agreed that the Purchaser shall be under no
obligation to reimburse for any compensation costs that would have been
covered by the Seller's or any of its Affiliates' insurance in the event
Seller or its Affiliates elect not to maintain coverage that is at least as
favorable to the Seller and its Subsidiaries as the coverage maintained as of
the date hereof).

  

(c)  For a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date,
the Purchaser shall provide each Transferred Employee who is employed by the
Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries during such period with compensation
(including a full year bonus opportunity for the 2020 fiscal year) and
benefits (other than equity-based compensation, defined benefit pension
benefits and retiree medical benefits) that, in the reasonable discretion of
the Purchaser, are either (i) no less favorable in the aggregate than such
Transferred Employee's compensation and benefits as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time or (ii) no less favorable in the aggregate than
the compensation and benefits provided to similarly situated employees of the
Purchaser from time to time.

  

(d)  Following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall, subject to
applicable Law, give each Transferred Employee full credit for prior service
with the Seller and its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities) for
purposes of (i) waiting periods to participate and vesting under any employee
benefit plans (other than defined benefit pension plans and equity or other
long term incentive plans) and (ii) determination of benefit levels relating
solely to vacation, sick, personal time off or severance plans and policies,
in each case, for which the Transferred Employee is otherwise eligible and in
which the Transferred Employee is offered participation, in each case, except
(A) if such credit would result in a duplication of benefits, (B) such service
was not credited under the corresponding Employee Plan immediately prior to
Closing Date, (C) to the extent prior service (whether service with a
predecessor employer or service with the Purchaser and its Affiliates) is not
generally credited under such plan for other employees of the Purchaser and
its Affiliates, or (D) for purposes of any retiree health and welfare plan or
agreement. In addition, the Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating
to pre-existing conditions to the same extent such limitations are waived
under any comparable plan of the Seller or its Subsidiaries applicable to
such Transferred Employee prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, Transferred Employees who are
employed by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates as of and after the Closing
pursuant to the Labor Agreements shall be provided the benefits that are
required by the respective Labor Agreement as in effect from time to time.

  

   

 | 79| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(e)  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, from and
after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its
Subsidiaries (including a Transferred Entity) to, and the Purchaser shall take
all actions necessary to cause the Purchaser or its applicable Subsidiary to,
assume any and all Liabilities, obligations and rights arising prior to, on
and after the Closing Date (or the applicable Employment Commencement Date,
if later) pursuant to each individual employment and severance agreement set
forth on _Section 6.2(e)(i)_ of the Disclosure Schedule (each, an " _Assumed
Plan_ "), such assumption to be effective as of the Closing Date (or
the applicable Employment Commencement Date, if later). Further, the
Purchaser shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to, assume the Seller's and its
Subsidiaries' (including the Transferred Entities') obligations to pay the
portion of the annual bonuses, if any, that become payable to Transferred
Employees in respect of the portion of the 2019 fiscal year from the Closing
Date through December 31, 2019, that become payable to Transferred Employees
pursuant to the bonus plans and agreements set forth on _Section 6.2(e)(ii)_
of the Disclosure Schedule (which shall also contain a true and complete
description of all applicable performance objectives and targets) in
accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein
(including the achievement of any applicable performance objectives), such
amounts to be paid at the same time as annual bonuses are payable to other
similarly-situated employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates and subject to
the applicable Transferred Employee's continued employment through the
applicable payment date.

  

(f)  As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, with
respect to each Transferred Employee who is a participant in the Sears
Hometown and Outlet Stores 401(k) Savings Plan (the " _Seller DC Plan_ "), the
Seller shall cause the plan administrator of the Seller DC Plan to provide
each such Transferred Employee with the right (but not the obligation) to
receive a distribution of such Transferred Employee's vested interest under
the Seller DC Plan and the option to elect to roll over such Transferred
Employee's vested interest in the Seller DC Plan to a defined contribution
plan established or maintained by the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates
(each, a " _Purchaser DC Plan_ ") intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code. Effective (i) as of the Closing Date, the Seller
shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cause the Transferred Employees to
cease participation under the Seller DC Plan and (ii) as of the Closing Date,
or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, cause the Transferred Employees to be eligible to
participate in the Purchaser DC Plan. The Purchaser shall take, or shall
cause one of its Affiliates to take, all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate (including amending the Purchaser DC Plans, if necessary) to
permit the Transferred Employees to roll over their vested interests in cash
and together with any loans in the Seller DC Plan to a Purchaser DC Plan if
such rollover is elected in accordance with applicable Law by such
Transferred Employee. The Purchaser shall cooperate, or cause one of its
Affiliates to cooperate, with the Seller in providing information to the
Transferred Employees regarding rollovers of their interests from the Seller
DC Plan to a Purchaser DC Plan.

  

   

 | 80| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(g)  On or prior to the Closing Date, the Seller or its
Subsidiaries shall, effective as of the Closing Date, transfer and assign the
collective bargaining agreements to which the Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party relating to any Transferred Employees (the " _Labor
Agreements_ ") to the Purchaser or the Affiliate of the Purchaser that will
employ the relevant Transferred Employees. The Purchaser shall, or shall
cause such applicable Affiliate to, adopt and assume the Labor Agreements and
recognize the unions that are party to the Labor Agreements with respect to
the Transferred Employees. From the Closing Date, the Purchaser or its
relevant Affiliate shall be solely responsible for all duties, obligations and
Liabilities related to the Labor Agreements. The Purchaser hereby
acknowledges that it has been notified of the existence of each of the Labor
Agreements to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the relevant
terms and conditions of each such Labor Agreement.

  

(h)  To the extent permissible under applicable Law, (a) the
Purchaser shall treat the Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate as a
"successor employer" and the Seller as a "predecessor" within the meaning of
Sections 3121(a)(1) and 3306(b)(1) of the Code with respect to Transferred
Employees for purposes of taxes imposed under the U.S. Federal
Unemployment Tax Act and the U.S. Federal Insurance Contributions Act and (b)
both the Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith and use
commercially reasonable efforts (including by exchanging information on a
reasonably timely basis) to avoid the restart of taxes imposed under the U.S.
Federal Insurance Contribution Act and U.S. Federal Unemployment Tax Act.

  

(i)  The Seller shall terminate the employment of each Offeree
Employee who has not affirmatively accepted the offer of employment from the
Purchaser or its Affiliates made in accordance with the terms of _Section
6.2(a)_ above, effective as of the Closing Date. From and after the Closing,
the Purchaser shall assume, and indemnify and hold the Seller and its
Subsidiaries harmless against, all Liabilities for severance pay or
separation benefits payable to any Offeree Employee who has not accepted an
offer of employment from Purchaser that was made in accordance with this
_Article VI_ in connection with any termination of such Offeree Employee's
employment on the Closing Date (" _Severance Liabilities_ "), including any
Losses and Liabilities arising on or after the Closing with respect to such
Offeree Employees' termination of employment under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act of 1988 and any applicable state or local
equivalent (collectively, " _WARN_ ") or any other applicable Law. The
Parties agree to cooperate in good faith to determine whether any notification
may be required under WARN as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and to provide any such notice that may be required.

  

(j)  Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, none of the
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries shall offer or agree to pay any severance
pay or benefits to any Offeree Employee in excess of the amounts required to
be paid to such Offeree Employee in accordance with the applicable Employee
Plan listed on the Disclosure Schedules.

  

   

 | 81| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(k)  From and after the Closing (or the applicable Employment
Commencement Date, if later), the Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its

unused vacation and sick leave (in each case, to the extent not required to

with advance copies of, and a reasonable opportunity to comment on, all such
communications.

Agreement, (i) the Purchaser or its Affiliates may revise, amend or terminate
any Employee Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program or policy in
effect from time to time, (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall be construed
as an amendment of any Employee Plan and (iii) no provision of this _Article
VI_ shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any Business Employee

Business Employee or Transferred Employee) in respect of continued employment
(or resumed employment) or any other matter.

  

Section 6.3   _AIP Retention Bonus Payments_. The Seller shall pay,

Closing Date, all amounts payable to each Business Employee pursuant to each
retention agreement by and between the Seller and a Business Employee
providing for a guaranteed minimum annual incentive plan bonus (the "
_AIP Retention Bonus Amounts_ "), in each case, in accordance with the terms
of such retention agreement. Seller acknowledges and agrees that the
consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed

Article VIII 
 Survival, RandW Insurance and Indemnification

  

Section 8.1   _Survival of Representations and Warranties and
Covenants_.

not survive the Closing for any purpose, and thereafter there shall be no

_Article III_ and _Article IV_.

  

(b)  After the Closing, there shall be no liability on the part

in this Agreement that contemplate actions (or inaction) to be taken (or not
taken) after the Closing (each, a " _Post-Closing Covenant_ ") shall survive
in accordance with their terms.

  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (including
the foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.1_ ), nothing herein or otherwise
shall be deemed to limit or inhibit the rights of the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (i) against the Seller or its Affiliates with respect to Fraud,
(ii) against any insurer under any RandW Insurance Policy or (iii) under any
Ancillary Agreement (other than any Closing certificate required to be
delivered at or prior to the Closing pursuant to _Section 7.2(d)_ or _Section
7.3(c)_ ), and in no event shall the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates be
deemed to have waived, released or relinquished any of such rights.

  

Section 8.2   _R andW Insurance Policy_. The Parties acknowledge
that, at the Closing, the Purchaser may obtain and bind a purchaser-side
representations and warranties insurance policy with respect to the
representations and warranties set forth in  _Article III_ (a " _R andW

and shall waive and not pursue any and all, subrogation rights against the
Seller or any of its Representatives (except in the case of fraud by the
Seller with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in
_Article III_ ) and the Seller and its Representatives shall be third party
beneficiaries of such waiver. Any costs and expenses related to the RandW
Insurance Policy, including the total premium, underwriting costs,

and other fees and expenses of such policy shall be borne by the Purchaser.

resulting from (a) any breach of any Post-Closing Covenant by the Seller or
its Subsidiaries or (b) any Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability.

  

   

 | 85| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

Section 8.4   _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. From and after
the Closing Date, the Seller and its Subsidiaries and their respective
officers, directors, employees, successors and permitted assigns (each, a "
_Seller Indemnified Party_ ") shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Purchaser from and against any and all Losses to the extent arising out of or
resulting from:

  

(a)  any breach of any Post-Closing Covenant by the Purchaser;
or

  

(b)  any Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability.

  

Section 8.5   _Notice of Loss; Third Party Claims_.

  

(a)  An Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party
notice of any matter which an Indemnified Party has determined has given or
could reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnification under
this Agreement, as promptly as reasonably practicable following (and in any
event within thirty (30) days of) such determination, including a reasonably
detailed description of the facts alleged to constitute the basis of such
claim, stating the amount or estimated amount of the Loss, if known or
reasonably ascertainable, and the method of computation thereof, and
containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of
which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises.

  

(b)  If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice from a third
party of any Action, audit, demand or assessment (each, a " _Third Party
Claim_ ") against it which could reasonably be expected to give rise to a
claim for Loss under this _Article VIII_ , as promptly as reasonably
practicable following (and in any event within thirty (30) days of) the
receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying
Party notice of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ that the failure to
provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this _Article VIII_  except to the extent that the defenses
or other rights available to the Indemnifying Party are actually and
materially prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its
expense and through counsel of its choice if it gives notice of its intention
to do so to the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of
such notice from the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party not be entitled to assume and control the defense of such
Third Party Claim, and shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel to
the Indemnified Party in defending such Third Party Claim, if, (A) there are
legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party, (B) there exists a
conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party, (C) such Third Party Claim seeks non-monetary relief (including
injunctive or other equitable relief) or (D) there is a criminal or
regulatory enforcement Action brought by any Governmental Authority, or any
other dispute involving the Indemnified Party, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority, on the other hand. If the Indemnifying Party elects
to undertake any such defense against a Third Party Claim the Indemnified
Party may participate in such defense at its own expense. The Indemnified
Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party, at the
Indemnifying Party's expense, in such defense and make available to the
Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, all pertinent
records, materials and information in the Indemnified Party's possession or
under the Indemnified Party's control relating thereto as may be reasonably
requested by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to
direct the defense of any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of such Third Party Claim unless the
Indemnifying Party consents in writing to such payment or unless a final
judgment from which no appeal may be taken by or on behalf of the
Indemnifying Party is entered against the Indemnified Party for such Third
Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of any such claims
or proceeding pursuant to this _Section 8.5_ or if the Indemnifying Party does
not assume and conduct the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party may continue to defend such Third Party Claim at the sole cost of the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not
control, the defense of such Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's
sole cost and expense.

  

   

 | 86| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(c)  The Indemnified Party shall not settle any matter relating
to a Third Party Claim, consent to the entry of any Governmental Order or
make an admission of fact with a comparable effect without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party. Conversely, in exercising its right of
control in accordance with _Section 8.5(b)_ , the Indemnifying Party shall not
settle a Third Party Claim, consent to the entry of any Governmental Order or
admit a fact with a comparable effect without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, except if and to the extent such settlement provides
for (A) the unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all
liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third Party Claim, (B)
there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law, any violation of
the rights of any Person or any other wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party and
(C) the sole relief provided is monetary damages for which the Indemnified
Party will have no obligation of payment. The Party controlling the
defense of any Third Party Claim shall promptly notify the other Party of
each settlement offer with respect to the Third Party Claim.

  

Section 8.6   _Tax Treatment_. To the extent permitted by Law, the
Parties agree to treat all payments made under this _Article VIII_ , under
any other indemnity provision contained in this Agreement, and for any
misrepresentations or breach of warranties or covenants, as adjustments to
the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.

  

Section 8.7   _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing,
except with respect to Fraud or under any Ancillary Agreement (other than any
Closing certificate required to be delivered at or prior to the Closing
pursuant to _Section 7.2(d)_ or _Section 7.3(c)_ ), (i) this _Article VIII_
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties (including
the Purchaser and the Seller) in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) neither the Purchaser nor the Seller
shall be liable or responsible in any manner whatsoever (whether for
indemnification or otherwise) to any Indemnified Party for a breach of this
Agreement or in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the purchase of the Purchased Assets and the Equity
Interests pursuant hereto, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions
set forth in this _Article VIII_ and (iii) each Party hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action (A) for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein or (B) otherwise relating to the
subject matter of this Agreement, in each case, that it may have against the
other Party and its Representatives arising under or based upon any
applicable Law, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth
in this _Article VIII_ or in respect of Fraud; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this _Section 8.7_ shall limit the rights or remedies of, or
constitute a waiver of any rights or remedies by, any Person pursuant to
(or shall otherwise operate to interfere with the operation of) _Section
2.6_ , _Section 2.7_ , _Section 2.10_ ,  _Section 5.11_ or _Section 10.14_ ;
_provided_ , _further_ , that nothing herein shall prevent any
Purchaser Indemnified Party from seeking recovery, or recovering, under the
RandW Insurance Policy in accordance with its terms.

to the Purchaser if the Purchaser's failure to fulfill any of its material
obligations under this Agreement shall have been the principal cause of, or
shall have principally resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or
prior to such date;

  

(b)  by either the Purchaser or the Seller in the event that (i)
any Law (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that Governmental
Orders are addressed in the following clause (ii) and not this clause (i)) is
enacted and has become effective that makes the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby illegal or otherwise prohibited or (ii) any
Governmental Order restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have become final and non-
appealable; _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 9.1(b)(ii)_  shall not be available to a Party if such Party's
failure to fulfill any of its material obligations under this Agreement shall
have been the principal cause of, or shall have principally resulted in, such
Governmental Order;

  

(c)  by the Seller if the Purchaser shall have breached any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement in a manner which would give rise to the failure of a condition
set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_  or _Section 7.3(b)_ , which breach (i) cannot
be cured by the Outside Date or (ii) if capable of being cured by the
Outside Date, shall not have been cured by the earlier of the Outside Date
and twenty (20) Business Days after the giving of written notice by the
Seller to the Purchaser specifying such breach; _provided_ , that the Seller
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 9.1(c)_ if the Seller is then in breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement in a manner which would give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ ;

be cured by the Outside Date or (ii) if capable of being cured by the

_Section 5.3(b)_ , _Section 5.10(c)_ and _Article X_ shall remain in effect
and (b) nothing herein shall relieve any Party from liability for any Willful

the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner in
order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  

Section 10.6   _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the
Schedules and Exhibits hereto), the Ancillary Agreements and the

respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the Seller and the

Debt Financing Source and the Seller may collaterally assign any of its
rights to its secured financing providers; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the Purchaser may assign any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement to an Affiliate if such assignment will not result in any non- _de
minimis_ delay in the consummation of the Sale or any incremental non- _de
minimis_ liabilities, costs or expenses for which the Seller or any of its
Affiliates would be responsible, and no such assignment shall release the
Purchaser from its obligations hereunder and, if the Purchaser assigns the
right and obligation to enter into any Ancillary Agreement at the Closing to
any of its Affiliates, then the Purchaser shall be liable for all obligations
of such Affiliate under such Ancillary Agreement.

Section 10.8   _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended or
modified except (a) by an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of,
the Seller and the Purchaser or (b) by a waiver in accordance with _Section
10.9_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Debt Financing
Provision may be amended, supplemented, changed or waived without the consent

Purchaser, on the other hand, may (a) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other Party contained herein or in any
document delivered by the other Party pursuant hereto or (b) waive compliance
with any of the agreements of the other Party or conditions to such Party's
obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party to be
bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed as
a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or
condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement. The
failure of any Party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not
constitute a waiver of any of such rights.

  

Section 10.10   _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or
implied (including the provisions of _Article VIII_ relating to indemnified
parties), is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any
rights of employment for any specified period, under or by reason of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Debt Financing Sources
shall be an express third party beneficiary with respect to this _Section
10.10_ , _Section 10.8_ , _Section 10.12(b)_ , _Section 10.13_ and _Section
10.16_  (such provisions, collectively, the " _Debt Financing Provisions_ "
and each other Non-Recourse Party shall be an express third party beneficiary
with respect to this _Section 10.10_ and _Section 10.16_.

  

Section 10.11   _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of
the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the choice of law principles
of such state that would require or permit the application of the Laws of
another jurisdiction.

  

Section 10.12   _Submission to Jurisdiction_.

  

(a)  Each of the Parties (i) consents to submit itself to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if such court
shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of
Delaware or other Delaware state court, in any Action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) agrees that all claims in respect of any such Action may be
heard and determined in the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if such court
shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of
Delaware or other Delaware state court, (iii) agrees that it shall not
attempt to deny or defeat such jurisdiction by motion or other request for
leave from any such court, (iv) agrees not to bring any Action arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (whether in contract, tort, common or statutory law, equity or
otherwise) in any other court and (v) agrees that a final judgment in any such
Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. Each of
the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any
Action brought in accordance with this  _Section 10.12_.

  

   

 | 92| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Parties agrees
that it will not, and it will not permit any of its Affiliates to, bring or
support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim
of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity and whether in
contract or tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing Sources in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including any dispute arising out of or relating to the Debt Financing or the
performance thereof) in any forum other than the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York or the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, New York County, located in the Borough of Manhattan or, in either
case, any appellate court from any thereof.

  

Section 10.13   _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEBT FINANCING AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS
DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THEREWITH OR CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY, INCLUDING IN ANY ACTION AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE. EACH OF
THE PARTIES HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE,
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
_Section_ _10.13_.

  

Section 10.14   _Specific Performance_.

  

(a)  The Parties hereby expressly recognize and acknowledge that
immediate, extensive and irreparable damage would result, no adequate remedy
at law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine if any
provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific
terms or is otherwise breached. Each Party further acknowledges that a breach
or violation of this Agreement cannot be sufficiently remedied by money
damages alone and, accordingly, subject to the limitations in
_Section 10.14(b)_ , each Party shall be entitled, without the need to post a
bond or other security, in addition to damages and any other remedies
provided at law or in equity, to specific performance, injunctive and other
equitable relief to enforce or prevent any violation. Each Party agrees not
to oppose the granting of such equitable relief, and to waive, and to cause
its representatives to waive, any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy.

  

(b)  Notwithstanding _Section 10.14(a)_ , it is acknowledged and
agreed that the right of the Company to a remedy of specific performance to
enforce Parent's or the Purchaser's obligation to cause the Equity Financing
to be funded and to consummate the Closing will be subject to the
requirements that (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and
_Section 7.2_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions at the Closing); (ii) the Debt Financing has been
funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at
the Closing; (iii) Parent or the Purchaser fails to complete the Closing by
the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.3_
; and (iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to the
Purchaser that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing
and Debt Financing are funded, then it would take such actions that are
required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur. In no event
will the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically
Parent's or the Purchaser's obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be
funded or to complete the Closing if the Debt Financing has not been funded
(or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing).

Section 10.15   _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile or other electronic transmission) in one or
more counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each
of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  

Section 10.16   _Non-Recourse_.

  

(a)  Except with respect to Actions arising under the RandW
Insurance Policy or any Ancillary Agreement, this Agreement may only be
enforced against, and any Action based upon, arising out of, or related to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement, may only be brought against the entities that are expressly named
as parties and signatories hereto and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party. No Person who is
not a named party and signatory to this Agreement, including any past,
present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member,
current or future direct or indirect equityholder, controlling person,
trustee, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or other
representative of the Purchaser (including any Vintage Person (other than the
Investor to the extent set forth in the Equity Commitment)), the Debt
Financing Sources, their respective Affiliates and any of their
Representatives, partners, managers, members or equityholders) or the Seller,
of any Affiliate of any Party or of any ESL Person, or any of their
successors or permitted assigns (collectively, " _Non-Recourse Parties_ "),
shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of any Party
under this Agreement or for any Action based on, in respect of or by reason of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including any alleged nondisclosure or
misrepresentations made by any such Persons, in each case, regardless of the
legal theory under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be
imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in
equity, or otherwise.

  

(b)  Without limiting clause (a) above and without limiting any
rights the Purchaser may have against any Debt Financing Source under the
Debt Commitment Letters, no Debt Financing Source who is not a party to this
Agreement shall have any liability to the Seller or any of its Affiliates for
any obligations or liabilities of the Purchaser or for any claim (whether at
law or in equity, tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. Without
prejudice to the Seller's rights in  _Section 5.10(a)_ , in no event shall
the Seller or any of its Affiliates (i) seek to enforce this Agreement
against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to
recover monetary damages from, any Debt Financing Source or (ii) seek to
enforce the Debt Financing or the Debt Commitment Letters against, make any
claims for breach of the Debt Financing or the Debt Commitment Letters
against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, or otherwise sue, any Debt
Financing Source for any reason, including in connection with the Debt
Financing or the Debt Commitment Letters or the obligations of the Debt
Financing Sources thereunder.

Section 10.17   _Guaranteed Obligations; Additional Obligations_.

  

(a)  Parent hereby guarantees the full and punctual performance
and payment when due of all covenants and obligations and sums due and owing
to the Seller by the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, on
or prior to the Closing (collectively, the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). In
addition to the Guaranteed Obligations, Parent independently agrees to (i)
make or cause to be made the Equity Contribution (as defined in, and as
contemplated by, the Debt Commitment Letter) prior to the Closing, (ii)
maintain in effect and satisfy on a timely basis all conditions set forth in
the Equity Commitment within Parent's control in accordance with the terms and
subject to the conditions thereof, (iii) if required to satisfy the Closing
Payment, draw upon and consummate the Equity Financing at or prior to the
Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment, and
(iv) if required to satisfy the Closing Payment, at the request of the
Seller, enforce its rights under the Equity Commitment to draw upon and
consummate the Equity Financing, subject to the terms and conditions of the
Equity Commitment ((i) through (iv) collectively, the " _Additional
Obligations_ "). Parent's obligations hereunder shall remain in full force
and effect until the Guaranteed Obligations and the Additional Obligations
have been paid or performed in full. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, following the earlier to occur of the consummation of the Closing and
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms, Parent shall have no
further liability or obligation under this Agreement; _provided_ that, in the
case of a termination of this Agreement resulting from a Willful Breach of
this Agreement by the Purchaser, Parent's obligations in respect of such
Willful Breach shall survive until such matter is finally resolved.

  

(b)  The guarantee set forth in _Section 10.17(a)_ is absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable and constitutes a guarantee of payment,
performance and discharge and not merely of collection. Such guarantee shall
not be subject to any counterclaim, set-off, deduction, diminution,
abatement, recoupment, suspension, deferment, reduction or defense for any
reason whatsoever. Except as provided in the last sentence of _Section
10.17(a)_ , Parent shall have no right to terminate such guarantee or to be
released, relieved or discharged from the Guaranteed Obligations or the
Additional Obligations for any reason whatsoever.

  

(c)  Parent hereby agrees that a separate action may be brought
against it whether or not an action is commenced against the Purchaser with
respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations. Except as provided in the last
sentence of _Section 10.17(a)_ , it is the intention of the Parties that
Parent shall remain liable as principal until the full amount of all sums
payable with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, if any, have been fully
paid, and the Guaranteed Obligations have been fully performed.

  

(d)  Parent hereby represents and warrants to the Seller as
follows:

  

(i)  Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of Delaware and has all necessary
corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry out
its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery by Parent of this
Agreement and the performance by Parent of its obligations hereunder have been
duly authorized by all requisite action on the part of Parent. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by Parent, and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Seller) this Agreement
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable
against Parent in accordance with its terms, except as limited by general
equitable principles and applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general application affecting
enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

  

   

 | 95| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(ii)  The execution, delivery and performance by Parent of this
Agreement and the consummation of its obligations hereunder do not and will
not (a) violate, conflict with or result in the breach of any provision of the
organizational documents of Parent, (b) conflict with or violate any Law or
Governmental Order applicable to Parent or its assets, properties or
businesses or (c) conflict with, result in any breach or violation of,
constitute a default (or event which with the giving of notice or lapse
of time, or both, would become a default) under, require any Consent under,
or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, any Contract to which Parent is a party, except, in the case
of clauses (b) and (c), as would not materially and adversely affect the
ability of Parent to carry out its obligations under this Agreement.
