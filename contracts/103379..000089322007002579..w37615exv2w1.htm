Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and Buyer will:

attorneys&#146; fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation arises out of or pertains to: (A)&nbsp;any action or omission or alleged action or
omission in such Indemnitee&#146;s capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates; or (B)&nbsp;the Merger, the Merger Agreement and any transactions
contemplated hereby; and (ii)&nbsp;advance all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses

are incurred and subject to receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay
such amounts if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified. If any indemnification claim is brought pursuant to this Section&nbsp;6.5(b) prior to the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, but is not resolved in full prior to such time, the
indemnification obligations of Parent and Buyer contained herein shall continue, solely with
respect to such claim, until such claim is resolved. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation for which indemnification may be sought under

indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (the &#147;<U>D&#038;O Insurance</U>&#148;) that is no less favorable in both amount and terms and
