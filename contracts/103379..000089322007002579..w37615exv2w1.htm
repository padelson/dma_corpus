 _WITNESSETH_  

   

 WHEREAS, in furtherance of the acquisition of the Company by Buyer, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Buyer (as the sole member of Acquisition Sub) have each approved and deemed advisable, and the members of the Company have irrevocably approved and consented in writing to, this Agreement and the merger of the Acquisition Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth herein and in accordance with the Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware, 6 Del. L. §§ 18-101, et seq. (" _Delaware Law_ "); 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties and covenants and subject to the conditions herein contained and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I

ARTICLE II  

  

THE MERGER  

  

 Section 2.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with Delaware Law, at the Effective Time, Acquisition Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of Acquisition Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue under the name "Seven For All Mankind, LLC" as the surviving limited liability company (the " _Surviving Company_ ") and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. 

  

 Section 2.2 Closing. Subject to the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on a date to be specified by the Parties, but no later than the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1, Section 7.2 and Section 7.3 hereof at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 153 East 53rd Street, New York, New York 10022, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the Parties (such date being the " _Closing Date_ "). 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 2.3 Effective Time. 

  

 (a) Concurrently with the Closing, the Company, Buyer and Acquisition Sub shall cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with respect to the Merger to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Secretary of State_ ") as provided under Delaware Law. The Merger shall become effective on the date and time at which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State or at such other date and time as is agreed between the Parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger, and such date and time is hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_." 

   

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall possess all of the rights, privileges and powers, and all property, real, personal and mixed, of the Company and Acquisition Sub, and all of the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Company and Acquisition Sub shall become the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Surviving Company, as provided in the Delaware Law. 

   

 Section 2.4 Limited Liability Company Agreement. Subject to Section 6.5 of this Agreement, the limited liability company agreement of Acquisition Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law or provisions of the limited liability company agreement. 

  

 Section 2.5 Board of Directors. Subject to applicable Law, each of the Parties shall take all necessary action to ensure that the management of the Surviving Company effective as of, and immediately following, the Effective Time shall be vested in the sole member of the Surviving Company or as may otherwise be provided in the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company. 

  

 Section 2.6 Officers. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable Law or their earlier death, resignation or removal. 

  

ARTICLE III  

  

EFFECT OF THE MERGER  

  

 Section 3.1 Effect on Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Acquisition Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Acquisition Sub: 

  

 (a) Except as set forth below, each Unit held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or held directly or indirectly by Buyer or Acquisition Sub, and each unvested Incentive Unit that will not otherwise vest as a result of the consummation of the Merger, shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time automatically be cancelled, retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each Unit issued and then outstanding (other than Units cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(a) hereof) shall be converted into the right to receive the applicable Per Unit Merger Consideration, and the holders of such Units shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Units, other than the right to receive in accordance with Section 3.2 of this Agreement, the appropriate Per Unit Merger Consideration, without interest thereon. 

   

 (c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, the limited liability company interests of Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become the outstanding limited liability company interests of the Surviving Company. 

   

 Section 3.2 _Closing Payments_. 

  

 (a) Prior to Closing, the Company shall cause the agent for the lenders under the Debt Agreements to prepare and deliver to the Company a "payoff letter" or similar document (collectively, the " _Payoff Letters_ ") specifying the aggregate amount of the Companys monetary obligations (including principal, accrued interest, fees and expenses) that will be outstanding as of (and after giving effect to) the Closing under the Debt Agreements (the " _Debt Repayment Amount_ "). At the Closing, Buyer shall (i) pay the Debt Repayment Amount in the manner provided in the Payoff Letters and (ii) cause all of the outstanding letters of credit issued on behalf of the Company to be fully cash collateralized or shall furnish such letters of credit or other substitute credit support arrangements as the beneficiaries of such letters of credit may reasonably request. 

   

 (b) At least two Business Days prior to Closing, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a certificate (the " _Merger Consideration Certificate_ ") duly certified by the Companys chief financial officer, as accurately setting forth: (i) the names of each Unitholder of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number and class of Units held by each such Unitholder, and the aggregate Per Unit Merger Consideration payable to such Unitholder pursuant to Section 3.1(b) in respect of such Units; and (ii) the manner in which Per Unit Merger Consideration has been calculated (including supporting calculations presented in reasonable detail together with any applicable underlying documentation reasonably requested by Buyer) for the determination of each of (A) the Aggregate Merger Consideration, (B) the Unreturned Class A Priority Amount, (C) the Unreturned Class B Priority Amount and (D) the Per Unit Residual Merger Consideration. The Class A Unitholder and the Class B Unitholders shall have the right to review and comment on the Merger Consideration Certificate prior to its delivery by the Company to Buyer. Buyer and the Company shall work together in good faith prior to the Closing in order to correct any manifest error that may appear on the face of the Merger Consideration Certificate. If there are any changes between the date of delivery of the Merger Consideration Certificate and the Closing in respect of items that are to be determined as of or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to Buyer at the Closing an updated Merger Consideration Certificate that reflects any such changes. At the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, remit to each Unitholder identified in the Merger Consideration Certificate the amount identified therein as payable to such Unitholder pursuant to Section 3.1(b) in respect of such Unitholders Units, which amounts shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds on the Closing Date to the account designated for such 

  ##### 

  

    

Unitholder in the Merger Consideration Certificate (or if an account is not
designated for such Unitholder in the Merger Consideration Certificate, by
check). Buyer shall be entitled to rely on the Merger Consideration
Certificate for remittance amounts and instructions, it being understood that
the aggregate amount to be remitted to Unitholders by Buyer pursuant to the
Merger Consideration Certificate shall in no event exceed the Aggregate
Merger Consideration. Parent, Buyer and the Surviving Company shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
Units such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom
under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law or
under any other applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld, the amount of such consideration shall be treated for all purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
consideration would otherwise have been paid. 

   

 Section 3.3 Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights. The cash amounts paid by Buyer pursuant to and in accordance with Section 3.2 in respect of the surrender of Units shall be deemed to be in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to all Units of the Company and, after the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the books of the Company of Units that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 3.4 Payments to Non-Listed Persons. If any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Units are registered on the books of the Company (as evidenced by the Schedule of Members under the Company LLC Agreement), it shall be a condition to such payment that the Person in whose name the Units are registered on the books of the Company shall have executed such transfer or consent documents as Buyer may reasonably request and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to Buyer any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Unit or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

ARTICLE IV  

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY  

  

 Except as disclosed in the separate disclosure schedule which has been delivered by the Company to Buyer concurrent with the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as follows: 

   

 Section 4.1 Organization and Qualification. The Company is a limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has the requisite limited liability company power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to have such power, authority and governmental approvals would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign limited liability company and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in 

   ##### 

  

    

which the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing
as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 4.1 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and correct list of each
jurisdiction in which the Company (a) is qualified to do business as a
foreign limited liability company, (b) maintains an office or (c) is required
to file a Tax Return.

 (a) Section 4.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and correct list of each Subsidiary of the Company, its place and form of organization and each jurisdiction in which it (i) is qualified to do business as a foreign company, limited liability company or other legal entity (as applicable), (ii) maintains an office or (iii) is required to file a Tax Return. 

   

 (b) Each Subsidiary of the Company is a corporation, limited liability company or other legal entity duly incorporated or organized (as applicable), validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and has all corporate or other organizational powers required to carry on its business as now conducted. Each such Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (c) Except as set forth in Section 4.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all of the outstanding equity or voting interests in each Subsidiary of the Company are owned by the Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of all encumbrances. Except as set forth in Section 4.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding (i) securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for equity or voting interests in any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, convertible securities or other similar rights, agreements, commitments or contracts, in each case written or oral, of any kind to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, equity or voting securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity or voting securities of any Subsidiary of the Company (the items in clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to collectively as the " _Company Subsidiary Securities_ "). Except as set forth in Section 4.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the Company Subsidiary Securities. 

   

 (d) Except for the Company Subsidiary Securities, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock of, or other equity, ownership, profit, voting or other interests in, any Person. 

    ##### 

  

  

 Section 4.3  _Company Organizational Documents_. The Company has made available to Buyer a complete and correct copy of the certificate of formation of the Company and the Company LLC Agreement (the " _Company Organizational Documents_ "). The Company Organizational Documents (or equivalent organizational documents) of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in full force and effect. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any provision of the Company Organizational Documents (or equivalent organizational documents), except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 Section 4.4 _Capitalization._  

  

 (a) The authorized equity capital of the Company consists of 113,750 Class A Units, 113,750 Class B Units and 28,116 Class C Units. There are outstanding 113,750 Class A Units, 113,750 Class B Units, and 26,404 Class C Units (of which 5,872 Units are designated as Class C-1 Units, 6,380 Units are designated as Class C-2 Units, and 6,380 Units are designated as Class C-3 Units), all of which are issued in uncertificated form. Section 4.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains the current Schedule of Members and is a true and complete list of the owners of record of all outstanding Units and the respective amounts of each class of Units owned thereby.

No equity or voting interest in the Company, securities of the Company convertible into or exchangeable for equity or voting interests in the Company or options or other rights to acquire from the Company, or other obligation of the Company to issue, any equity or voting interests or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity or voting interests in the Company are owned by any Subsidiary of the Company. 

   

 (b) All outstanding Units of the Company are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to preemptive rights. To the Companys Knowledge, all issued and outstanding Units are free and clear of all encumbrances, except those arising under federal, state or foreign securities laws or the Company Organizational Documents. Section 4.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth all agreements with or among the Unitholders to which the Company is a party or of which the Company is aware, including any agreement which imposes any limitation or restriction on any Units including any restriction on the right of a Unitholder to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of Units. 

   

 (c) Except as set forth above and except as permitted under Section 6.1 hereof, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, convertible securities or other similar rights, agreements, commitments or contracts, in each case written or oral, of any kind to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional Units or other equity or voting securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Units or other equity or voting securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such security, option, warrant, call, right or contract. 

   

 Section 4.5  _Authority Relative to Agreement_. The Company has all necessary limited liability company power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform 

   ##### 

  

    

its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary limited liability company and member action, and
no other limited liability company proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement or to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
(other than, with respect to the Merger, the filing of the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State). This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the other parties hereto, this
Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights, and to general equitable

The Parties agree that in connection with any Antitrust Filings under any Foreign Competition Law (other than Antitrust Filings in Germany, which shall be governed by the previous sentence), "best efforts" shall not be deemed to include any commitment by Parent, Buyer or Acquisition Sub to any divestiture, license or hold separate or similar arrangements with respect to (i) the assets or conduct of business arrangements of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) any material portion of the business, assets or properties of the Company (or the Surviving Company, as applicable) and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 (b) The Parties shall comply with, and shall cause their respective Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_  that nothing herein or therein shall be deemed to prevent Parent from complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable Law, including filing this Agreement with the SEC. 

   

 Section 6.4  _Exclusivity_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, and except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, the Company agrees that neither it nor any Subsidiary of the Company shall, and that it shall cause its and their respective Affiliates and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (a) initiate contact with, solicit, encourage or disclose any information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries to, (b) afford any access to the personnel, offices, facilities, properties, books and records of the Company or its Subsidiaries to, or (c) enter into any discussion, negotiation, understanding, agreement or arrangement with, any individual or entity (other than Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives) concerning, or otherwise cooperate with respect to or facilitate, a potential acquisition by such individual or entity of at least 15% equity interest in the Company or at least 15% of its and its Subsidiaries assets (a " _Third Party Transaction_ "). If the Company or a Representative of the Company receives a bona fide offer from an individual or entity (other than Buyer or its Representatives) to effect a Third Party Transaction during the Exclusivity Period, the Company will promptly notify Buyer of the same, including its material terms and conditions. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for purposes of this Section 6.4, any Affiliate or Representative of any holder of Class A Units or Class B Units, shall be considered an Affiliate or Representative of the Company and shall be subject hereto. 

  

 Section 6.5  _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance; Release_. 

  

 (a) Parent, Buyer and Acquisition Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers, as the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as 

    ##### 

  

    

provided in the Company Organizational Documents (or comparable organization
documents) or in any agreement, in each case to the extent permitted by
applicable law, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect. Parent, Buyer and the Surviving Company shall (and Parent and Buyer
shall cause the Surviving Company to) indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, and advance expenses to Indemnitees with respect to all acts or
omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent required by: (i) the Company
Organizational Documents (or equivalent organizational documents) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates as in effect on the date of
this Agreement; and (ii) any indemnification agreements of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or other applicable contract as in effect on the date of this
Agreement. 

   

 (b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 6.5(a), during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and Buyer will: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee against and from any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (A) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnitees capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates; or (B) the Merger, the Merger Agreement and any transactions contemplated hereby; and (ii) advance all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) of any Indemnitee as such reasonable and documented expenses are incurred and subject to receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amounts if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified. If any indemnification claim is brought pursuant to this Section 6.5(b) prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, but is not resolved in full prior to such time, the indemnification obligations of Parent and Buyer contained herein shall continue, solely with respect to such claim, until such claim is resolved. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.5(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement, none of Parent, Buyer or the Surviving Company shall (and Parent and Buyer shall cause the Surviving Company not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this Section 6.5(b) unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnitees from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 

   

 (c) Parent or Buyer will provide, or cause the Surviving Company to provide, for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are insured under the Companys directors and officers insurance and indemnification policy with an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is no less favorable in both amount and terms and conditions of coverage than the existing policy of the Company or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage. 

   

 (d) The Indemnitees to whom this Section 6.5 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.5. The provisions of this Section 6.5 are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee, and his or her successors, heirs or representatives. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (e) Effective as of the Effective Time, each of Parent, Buyer and the Surviving Company hereby fully, finally and irrevocably releases and forever discharges each of the Unitholders and each of their respective Affiliates and Representatives (collectively, the " _Released Parties_ ") from any and all Claims arising directly or indirectly from, or relating directly or indirectly to, any act, omission, event, matter, circumstance or transaction that arises, occurs or exists, as applicable, at or prior to the Effective Time (except for acts or omissions involving fraud or intentional misconduct), relating to such Released Partys capacity as a member. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 9.1 or Section 9.6 hereof to the contrary, this Section 6.5 shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, Buyer, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Company or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Company shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5. 

   

 Section 6.6  _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to each of Parent and Buyer, and each of Parent and Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Company or Buyer and (ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby or that, if pending as of the date hereof, would have been required to be disclosed pursuant to Section 4.10, Section 4.11, Section 4.12, Section 4.13, Section 4.14, Section 4.15, Section 4.17 or Section 4.19. 

  

 Section 6.7  _Public Announcements_. Parent, Buyer and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be required by Law or any listing agreement with the NYSE to which Parent, Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party. 

  

 Section 6.8  _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) During the one-year period commencing on the Effective Date, Parent shall provide or shall cause Buyer or the Surviving Company to provide to employees of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries who become employees of the Surviving Company or any of its Affiliates (" _Company Employees_ ") compensation and benefits that are, in the aggregate, 

   ##### 

  

    

materially no less favorable than the compensation and benefits being provided
to Company Employees (other than equity or equity equivalents) immediately
prior to the Effective Time under the Company Benefit Plans. 

   

 (b) Without limiting paragraph (a) of this Section 6.8, Parent shall honor, fulfill and discharge, and shall cause Buyer or the Surviving Company to honor, fulfill and discharge, the Companys and its Subsidiaries obligations to any Company Employees or other participants as of the Effective Time under any Company Benefit Plan. 

   

 (c) For purposes of eligibility and vesting under the benefit plans, programs, agreements and arrangements of Parent, other than Parents retirement savings plans, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Closing (the " _New Plans_ "), and for purposes of accrual of vacation and other paid time off and severance benefits under the New Plans, each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates (and any additional service with any predecessor employer) before the Closing, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan. For purposes of Parents retirement savings plans, no years of service prior the Effective Time shall be credited for purposes of vesting in Parents contributions. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be eligible to participate as soon as reasonably practicable, without any waiting periods that would otherwise be applicable to new employees, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the replacement; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Company Employee which replaces coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the replacement, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent such exclusions were not applicable or requirements were waived under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan, and Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents under any Company Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year of the New Plan ending on the date such Company Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

   

 (d) Nothing in this Section will be or be deemed to be for the benefit of or enforceable by, any person who is not a party hereto, including, without limitation, any employee of the Company, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates or shall be deemed to limit the Parents, Buyers, the Surviving Companys or their Affiliates ability to modify or eliminate any Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms or modify the at-will nature of any Company Employees employment. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (e) The Company shall terminate its participation in the LKoral 401(k) plan in accordance with the terms of that plan prior to the Closing Date and shall use its best efforts to take such corrective measures with respect to its participation in such plan as may be determined to be necessary under applicable IRS guidelines. 

   

 (f) With respect to Company Employees who have employment agreements with the Company that contain EBITDA-based bonus targets, the Company agrees that, in determining eligibility for, and calculating, such bonuses for the 2007 calendar year, it shall: (i) calculate EBITDA in a manner that adds back the carrying costs of the Debt Agreements paid off hereunder and excludes any non-recurring charges directly related to the Merger transaction and any cost allocations from Parent that are extraordinary to the Companys operating plan for 2007 as in effect at the date hereof; and (ii) apply the "Valuation EBITDA" described in the minutes of the Meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company held on January 12, 2007 (which, for the avoidance of doubt, applied a "Minimum EBITDA Target" of $65,600,000 and a "Maximum EBITDA Target" of $72,500,000). 

   

 Section 6.9  _Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Parent, Buyer, the Acquisition Sub, and the Company agree to take the position that the status of the Company as a partnership for income tax purposes (and to the extent allowed under law, for any other Tax purpose as well) shall cease as of the Effective Time and that, immediately after the Effective Time, the Company shall be viewed as owned by one person for federal income tax purposes. 

   

 (b) The Class A Unitholder shall prepare and timely file all U.S. federal and state partnership income Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries attributable to any periods ending on or before the Closing Date that are not yet due by Closing (each, a " _Company Return_ "). If and to the extent that there are Straddle Returns for any Tax that would be payable by the Unitholders themselves (as opposed to Tax which would be payable by the Company or its Subsidiaries and not by the Unitholders) or any Tax Returns whose completion is necessary in order to complete the U.S. federal and state partnership income Tax Returns described in the previous sentence, then the Class A Unitholder shall be entitled to review and approve all such Tax Returns before they are filed, provided that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Companys and each of its Subsidiarys past practice except as otherwise required by the provisions of this Agreement or as otherwise required by law. 

   

 (c) Following the Closing Date, the Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to give the Class A Unitholder and its agents and/or authorized representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and permit the Class A Unitholder and its agents and/or representatives to make copies thereof) to the extent reasonably related to Company Returns (including, but not limited to, preparation of such Company Returns and actions attributable to such Tax Returns). Each of the parties hereto will provide the other parties with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by any of them in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, or any audit or other examination by any tax authority with respect to Taxes, and each will retain and provide 

   ##### 

  

    

the others with any records or information that may be reasonably relevant to
any such Tax Return, action or claim. To the extent such assistance will not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and
subject to employee availability, such assistance shall include making
employees of Company and its Subsidiaries available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder and shall include providing copies of any relevant Tax
Returns and supporting work schedules, which assistance shall be provided
without charge. The Company shall retain, until all appropriate statutes of
limitation (including any extensions) expire, copies of all Company Returns,
supporting work schedules and other records or information which may be
relevant to such Company Returns. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, none of Parent, Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiaries shall file any amended Company Return relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries attributable to periods ending on or before the Closing Date (or otherwise change such Company Returns) or make an election with respect to taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, if such filing, change or election would increase the Tax liability of any Unitholder; provided, however, that Parent, Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to make any Tax election relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 Section 6.10  _Koral Employment Terms_.
