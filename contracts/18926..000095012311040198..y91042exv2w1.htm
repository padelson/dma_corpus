 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of April 26, 2011, among SAVVIS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), CENTURYLINK, INC., a Louisiana corporation (" _Parent_ "), and MIMI ACQUISITION COMPANY, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "). 

   

 WHEREAS the Board of Directors of the Company, the Board of Directors of Parent, and the Board of Directors of Merger Sub have approved this Agreement, determined that the terms of this Agreement are in the best interests of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, and their respective stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, and declared the advisability of this Agreement; 

   

 WHEREAS the Board of Directors of the Company and the Board of Directors of Merger Sub have recommended adoption or approval, as applicable, of this Agreement by their respective stockholders, as applicable; 

   

 WHEREAS concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, certain stockholders, who are the beneficial owners of an aggregate of 13,105,304 shares of common stock, par value $0.01, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), are entering into an agreement with Parent pursuant to which such stockholders have agreed to vote all shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by such stockholders in favor of the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Voting Agreement_ "); and 

   

 WHEREAS the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties and covenants herein and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

   

 _ARTICLE I_  

   

 _The Merger_  

  

 SECTION 1.01. _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), on the Closing Date, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "). At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving company in the Merger (the " _Surviving Company_ "). 

   

 SECTION 1.02. _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date to be specified by the Company and Parent, which shall be no later than the fifth Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver 

      ##### 

  

    

of those conditions), or at such other place, time and date as shall be
agreed in writing between the Company and Parent; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that if all the conditions set forth in Article VII shall not have been
satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law) waived on such fifth Business
Day, then the Closing shall take place on the fifth Business Day on which all
such conditions shall have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law)
waived, or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing
between the Company and Parent. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_." 

   

 SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the certificate of merger relating to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed and acknowledged in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings required under the DGCL or by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time that the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as the Company and Parent shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ "). 

   

 SECTION 1.04. _Effects_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and Section 259 of the DGCL. 

   

 SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws_. The certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, except that the name of the Surviving Company shall be SAVVIS, INC. The by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Company until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, except that references to the name of Merger Sub shall be replaced by references to the name of the Surviving Company. 

   

 SECTION 1.06. _Directors and Officers of Surviving Company_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be. 

   

 _ARTICLE II_  

   

 _Effect on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Entities; Exchange of
Certificates_  

  

 SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or Merger Sub Common Stock: 

     ##### 

  

      

 (i) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, in Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into 1 fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Company. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Company into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

   

 (ii) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company as treasury stock and each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (iii) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Sections 2.02 and 2.03, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(ii) and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive (x) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (rounding to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share) equal to the quotient (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") obtained by dividing (A) $10.00 by (B) the Parent Trading Price (as defined below); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Parent Trading Price is equal to or less than $34.42, the Exchange Ratio shall equal 0.2905 (the " _Stock Consideration_ ") and (y) $30.00 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ " and, together with the Stock Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled upon the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Parent Common Stock_ " means the common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Parent and (ii) " _Parent Trading_   _Price_ " means the volume-weighted sales price per share taken to four decimal places of Parent Common Stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange for the consecutive period of thirty trading days beginning at 9:30 a.m. New York time on the thirty-third trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date and concluding at 4:00 p.m. New York time on the third trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date, as calculated by Bloomberg Financial LP under the function "VWAP." Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, 

   ##### 

  

   

subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any number
or amount contained herein which is based upon the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as the case may be, will
be appropriately adjusted to provide to Parent and the holders of Company
Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event. As provided in Section 2.02(j), the right of any holder of a
Certificate to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and
reduced by the amount of any required withholding under applicable Tax Law. 

  

 SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment and delivery of the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II through the Exchange Agent, (i) certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as Stock Consideration and (ii) cash sufficient to (x) pay the Cash Consideration and (y) make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(f). All such Parent Common Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent is hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." 

   

 (b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within ten Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common Stock a form of letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent may specify subject to the Companys reasonable approval), together with instructions thereto. 

   

 (c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_. Upon (i) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate, the surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, or (ii) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form, the receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent, in each case together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the Merger Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01 and (ii) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and in respect of any dividends or other distributions which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(d). In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and in respect of any dividends or other distributions which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(d) may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Company Common Stock (or, if such Company Common Stock is held in book-entry form, proper 

    ##### 

  

    

evidence of such transfer) is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence
that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.02(c), each share of Company Common Stock,
and any Certificate with respect thereto, shall be deemed at any time from
and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration which the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock were entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to
Section 2.01 (and cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.02(f) and in respect of any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
Section 2.02(d)). No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash
payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock
held in book-entry form). 

   

 (d) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon surrender thereof, and no cash payment with respect to the Cash Consideration or in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder, until the surrender of such Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) in accordance with this Article II. Subject to escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form), there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. 

   

 (e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The shares of Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.02(f)) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 (f) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01.

     ##### 

  

    

taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock exchanged by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the last reported sale price of
Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") (as
reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported therein, in another
authoritative source mutually selected by Parent and the Company) on the last
complete trading day prior to the date of the Effective Time. 

   

 (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article II, in each case without any interest thereon. 

   

 (h) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 (k) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, issue the Stock Consideration and pay the Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and distributions on such Certificate, in each case deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 SECTION 2.03. _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, no shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and 

    ##### 

  

    

outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder who
has properly exercised such stockholders appraisal rights in respect of such
shares (any such shares being referred to herein as " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(iii) and instead shall be
entitled to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL (unless and
until such stockholder shall have failed to timely perfect, or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost, such stockholders right to dissent from the
Merger under the DGCL) and to receive such consideration as may be determined
to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to
the requirements of the DGCL. The Company (i) shall give Parent prompt notice
of any notice or demand for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common
Stock or any withdrawals of such demands received by the Company, (ii) shall
give Parent the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to any such demands and (iii) shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such
demands.

financing sources) ( _provided_ that all such information has previously been
provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially
concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person) pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement with the Person making such Takeover
Proposal (or with one or more of its financing sources) not less restrictive
of such Person as to the use of such information than the Confidentiality
Agreement, and (y) participate in discussions regarding the terms of such
Takeover Proposal and the negotiation of such terms with, and only with, the
Person making such Takeover Proposal (and such Persons Representatives and
any financing sources). Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.02(a) by any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall
constitute a breach of this Section 5.02(a) by the Company. 

   

 (b) Except as set forth below, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Parent), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board or any such committee thereof with respect to this Agreement or (B) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Takeover Proposal (any action in this clause (i) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow the Company or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, alliance agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement or arrangement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the Company to fail to comply with this Agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.02(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make an Adverse Recommendation Change until after the fourth Business 

       ##### 

  

    

Day following Parents receipt of written notice (a " _Notice of
Recommendation Change_ ") from the Company advising Parent that the Company
Board intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor,
including in the case of a Superior Proposal, the terms and conditions of
any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company
Board (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term
of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Recommendation Change
and a new four Business-Day period). In determining whether to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall take into account
any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to
a Notice of Recommendation Change or otherwise. 

   

 (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 5.02, the Company shall promptly, and in any event within 24 hours of the receipt thereof, advise Parent orally and in writing of any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall (x) keep Parent informed in all material respects and on a reasonably current basis of the status and details (including any change to the terms thereof) of any Takeover Proposal, and (y) provide to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other written material exchanged between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Person that describes any of the terms or conditions of any Takeover Proposal. 

   

 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit the Company from (x) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (y) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with outside counsel) failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure that addresses or relates to the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board with respect to this Agreement or a Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board in connection with such communication publicly states that its recommendation with respect to this Agreement has not changed; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action, or make any statement, that would violate Section 5.02(b).

 " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (whether or not in writing), with respect to any (i) merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii) sale, lease, contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests in a Company Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business or assets of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, to any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) or group of securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, 

   ##### 

 

   

such securities) representing 20% or more of the voting power of the Company,
(iv) transaction in which any Person (or the stockholders of any Person)
shall acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to
acquire beneficial ownership, or formation of any group which beneficially
owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 20% or more of the
Company Common Stock or securities (or options, rights or warrants to
purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such
securities) representing 20% or more of the voting power of the Company or
(v) any combination of the foregoing (in each case, other than the Merger). 

   

 " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written proposal or offer made by a third party or group pursuant to which such third party (or, in a parent-to-parent merger involving such third party, the stockholders of such third party) or group would acquire, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the Company Common Stock or substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i) on terms which the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be superior from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock than the Merger, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes proposed by Parent to the terms of this Agreement), and (ii) that is reasonably likely to be completed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal.

any Adverse Recommendation Change by the Company Board; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the public announcement of an Adverse Recommendation
Change or the delivery of a Company Notice of Recommendation Change is less

If any material is withheld by the Company pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, the Company shall inform Parent as to the general nature of what is being withheld. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement dated February 10, 2011 among the Company, CenturyTel Service Group, LLC and Qwest Communications International Inc.

To the extent necessary in order to accomplish the foregoing and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.03(e), the Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to jointly negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order, condition or approval or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of, or prohibition or limitation on the ownership or operation of, or requirements or undertakings with respect to the conduct by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, of any portion of the business, properties or assets of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor the Company shall be required pursuant to this Section 6.03(c) to commit to or effect any action that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger or that would or would reasonably be expected to result in a Substantial Detriment.

 (e) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein but subject to the proviso of the second sentence of Section 6.03(c), the provisions of this Section 6.03 shall not be construed to require the Company, Parent, or their respective Subsidiaries to offer, take, commit to or accept any action, restrictions or limitations (" _Actions_ ") of or on the Company, Parent, or their respective Subsidiaries, or to permit such Actions without the prior written consent of the other party, if such Actions, individually or in the aggregate, would or would reasonably be expected to result in a Substantial Detriment. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, during the term of this Agreement neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives shall cooperate with any other party in seeking regulatory clearance of any Takeover Proposal. 

   

 (g) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

     ##### 

  

      

 (i) adjust the terms of all outstanding Company Stock Options to provide that, at the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent and converted into an option (a " _Converted Parent Option_ ") to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that each Converted Parent Option shall vest and become exercisable immediately following the conversion), a number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Stock Award Exchange Ratio (as defined below), rounded down to the nearest whole share, at a per share exercise price determined by dividing the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent; _provided_ , _however_ , that each Company Stock Option (x) which is an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code and (y) shall be adjusted in a manner which complies with Section 409A of the Code; 

   

 (ii) As to each holders restricted stock units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company Stock Plans, other than those granted pursuant to the Companys annual incentive plan (the " _Company RSUs_ "): 

   

 (A) 50% of such Company RSUs (the " _First Tranche RSUs_ ") shall be converted, at the Effective Time and without regard to any applicable performance targets, into the right to receive cash and shares of Parent Stock equal to the Merger Consideration, determined in accordance with Section 2.01(iii), in respect of that number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by the First Tranche RSUs; _provided_ that, the First Tranche RSUs of each holder shall include those Company RSUs as to which the vesting dates follow the Closing Date but are earlier than the later of (x) December 31, 2012 or (y) the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the later of (x) and (y), the " _Second Tranche Vesting Date_ "), in order starting with the soonest vesting to the Closing Date until all of the Company RSUs for which vesting is earlier then the Second Tranche Vesting Date have been identified and, if all of the Company RSUs as to which the vesting date is earlier than the Second Tranche Vesting Date comprise less than 50% of all the holders Company RSUs, additional Company RSUs shall be considered First Tranche RSUs based starting with the latest vesting date and working in reverse order of vesting dates until all of the First Tranche RSUs have been identified. For the purposes of this Section 6.04(a)(ii)(A) an amount necessary to satisfy the applicable minimum tax withholding obligation shall first be reduced from the amount of the Cash Consideration to be receive and then, if necessary, from the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be received pursuant to the Stock Consideration.

 (iii) Each Company Restricted Share that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest in full immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.01(iii); 

   

 (iv) Each Annual Incentive Company RSU award in respect of the performance year in which the Closing Date occurs shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, be converted into a right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are earned under such Annual Incentive Company RSU award based on the actual achievement of the applicable performance measures as of the Effective Time, as determined in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Companys Annual Incentive Plan for the applicable performance year, with such performance measures pro-rated for the portion of such performance year in which the Closing Date occurs, multiplied by (B) the sum of (x) the Cash Consideration plus (y) twenty-five percent (25%) of the closing price per share of Parent Common Stock on the last trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date, multiplied by (C) the quotient of the number of days in the applicable performance year through the Closing Date divided by 365 (rounded to the fourth decimal point); and 

   

 (v) For the purposes of this Section 6.04(a), (A) " _Stock Award Exchange Ratio_ " means the sum of (1) the Exchange Ratio plus (2) a fraction resulting from dividing the Cash Consideration by the closing price per share of Parent Common Stock on the last trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date and (B) " _Good Reason_ " shall mean any of the following events or conditions, but only if the holder shall have provided written notice to the Parent within ninety (90) days of the initial existence or occurrence of such event or condition and the Parent shall have failed to cure such event or condition within thirty (30) days of its receipt of such notice: (1) a material 

   ##### 

  

   

reduction in the holders base salary or target bonus opportunity or (2) a
relocation of the holders employment more than fifty (50) miles from the
metropolitan area in which the holders office is located at the time of
resignation. 

  

 (b) provide that with respect to the Company ESPP, (A) each purchase right under the Company ESPP outstanding on the day immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically suspended and any contributions made for the then-current Withholding Period (as defined in the Company ESPP) will be applied toward the purchase of Company Common Stock, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each such share of Company Common Stock shall be treated in accordance with Section 2.01(iii), and (B) the Company ESPP shall terminate, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all the obligations of the Company under the Company Stock Plans, each outstanding Converted Parent Option and Converted Second Tranche RSU and the agreements evidencing the grants thereof. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Converted Parent Stock Options and Converted Second Tranche RSUs appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights, and the agreements evidencing the grants of such Converted Parent Options and Converted Second Tranche RSUs shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 6.04 after giving effect to the Merger). 

   

 (d) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise or settlement of the Converted Parent Options and Converted Second Tranche RSUs in accordance with this Section 6.04.

disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative

In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing Date the Company may, with the prior written consent of Parent, purchase a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy and fiduciary liability insurance policy for the Company and its current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors and officers and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company, such tail to provide coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company with respect to

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) if the condition set forth in Section 7.01(f) is not satisfied and the Legal Restraint giving rise to such non-satisfaction shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ that the terminating party shall have complied with its obligations pursuant to Section 6.03; or 

   

 (iii) if the Company Stockholder Approval is not obtained at the Company Stockholders Meeting duly convened (unless such the Company Stockholders Meeting has been adjourned, in which case at the final adjournment thereof); 

  

 (c) by the Company, if Parent or Merger Sub breaches or fails to perform any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or if any of the representations or warranties of Parent or Merger Sub contained herein fails to be true and correct, which breach or failure (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.02(a) or 7.02(b) and (ii) is not reasonably capable of being cured by the End Date or, if reasonably capable of being cured, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, does not diligently attempt, or ceases to diligently attempt, to cure such breach or failure after receiving written notice from the Company; 

   

 (d) by Parent, if the Company breaches or fails to perform any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or if any of the representations or warranties of the Company contained herein fails to be true and correct, which breach or failure (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.03(a) or 7.03(b) and (ii) is not reasonably capable of being cured by the End Date or, if reasonably capable of being cured, the Company does not diligently attempt, or ceases to diligently attempt, to cure such breach or failure after receiving written notice from Parent; or 

   

 (e) by Parent, in the event that an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred;  _provided_ that Parent shall no longer be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(e) if the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained at the Company Stockholders Meeting. 

   

 SECTION 8.02. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, other than the last sentence of Section 6.02, Section 6.06, this Section 8.02 and Article IX, which provisions shall survive such termination, and no such termination shall relieve any party from any liability for any statement, act or failure to act by such party that it intended to be a misrepresentation or a breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement. 

   

 SECTION 8.03. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without the further approval of such stockholders, and (ii) except as provided above, no amendment of this Agreement shall be submitted to be approved by the stockholders of the Company unless 

   ##### 

  

    

required by Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. 

   

 SECTION 8.04. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (c) waive compliance with any covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or (d) waive the satisfaction of any of the conditions contained in this Agreement. No extension or waiver by the Company shall require the approval of the stockholders of the Company unless such approval is required by Law. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. 

   

 SECTION 8.05. _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an amendment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 or an extension or waiver pursuant to Section 8.04 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, action by its Board of Directors or the duly authorized designee thereof. Termination of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time shall not require the approval of the shareholders of Parent or the stockholders of the Company.

 SECTION 9.05. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights under this Section 9.05 with respect thereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 SECTION 9.10. _Specific Enforcement_. The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to in clause (a) below, without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any Delaware state court or any Federal court located in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than any Delaware state court or any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware.

    #####

respective Affiliates (collectively, the " _Lender Related Parties_ ") shall
have any liability or obligation to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein (including
the Financing); provided, however, that nothing in this Section 9.12 shall in

Parent or any of its Affiliates. This Section 9.12 is intended to benefit the
