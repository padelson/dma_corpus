respect to the Company for any material amount of Taxes. Except as set forth
on SCHEDULE 3.1(c), no assessment of Tax has been proposed in writing
against the Company or any of its assets or properties. No waiver or
extension of any statute of limitations is in effect with respect to Taxes or
Tax Returns of the Company. There is no dispute or claim with any taxing
authority concerning any Tax liability of the Company either (A) claimed or
raised by any taxing authority in writing or (B) as to which Seller
has knowledge.   (7) Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 3.1(c), the

any agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that has resulted or would
result, whether separate from or in the aggregate with the Seller
Affiliated Group, in the payment of any amount that will not be
fully deductible as a result of Section 162(m) of the Code (or
any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Tax law).   (13) The
Company has not agreed, nor is it required to make, any adjustment under Code

hereto, and other than any such invalidity, failure, breach, default
or waiver, as applicable, which, individually or in the aggregate, would not

set forth on SCHEDULE 3.1(d), consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not require any consent of any party to any
Material Contract (and will not give any Person a right to) terminate
or modify any rights or obligations of the Company under any Material
Contract.   (e) Real Property; Liens. \t ____________________   (1) The
Company does not own or lease, other than pursuant to a lease that is a
Material Contract, any real property other than the Property and the Tampa
Terminal Facility. The Company or Seller has good, marketable and insurable
fee title or leasehold interest, as applicable, in and to the Property, free

(the "Leases"). The Company has paid all rents and other charges to the
extent due and payable under  \t\t\t\t14   the Leases, except as
otherwise disclosed on SCHEDULE 3.1(e). The Leases are in full force and
effect. The Company is not in default under the Leases, and to Seller\'s
knowledge, no other party to any of the Leases is in default thereunder, and
there are no circumstances known to Seller that with the passage of time or
the giving of notice would constitute a default under any of the Leases. No
written notice has been given or received by Seller of any default under any
of the Leases that has not been cured. To Seller\'s knowledge, no other party
to any of the Leases has any defense to its obligations under the Leases or
has any charge, claim or right of offset against rent or other charges due
under the Leases. No party has any option to renew or extend any of
the Leases, or to expand or contract the leased premises, or to purchase or
sell the leased premises, except as set forth in the Leases. No party has
exercised in writing any option or right to extend or renew the Lease beyond
its current term, or to expand the premises leased thereunder, or to purchase

it purports to own or have the right to use as reflected in the Reference
Balance Sheet, except for assets disposed of in the ordinary course of
business since December 31, 2002 (the "Personal Property"), so as to allow
the Business to be conducted as and where currently conducted. The Personal
Property is free of Liens other than Permitted Liens and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will not alter or impair such ability in
any respect which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each item of Personal Property
that had an original cost greater than U.S.$50,000 has been maintained
in accordance with normal industry practice.   (g) Authorization; No
Conflicts. \t ____________________________   The execution, delivery and
performance by Seller of this Agreement and the Supply Contract have been
duly and validly authorized by the Board of Directors of Seller and by all
other necessary corporate action on the part of Seller. This Agreement and,

bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws and
equitable principles relating to or limiting creditors\' rights
generally. Except for matters identified in SCHEDULE 3.1(g), and any

(ii) result in the imposition of any Lien against any assets or properties of
the Company, (iii) violate any Law, or (iv) require any Approvals to be

all pending or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened Actions to which the
Company is a party or that relate to the Business.   (i) Compliance with

matters and permits, which are the subject of Sections 3.1(c), 3.1(j), 3.1(m)
and 3.1(n), respectively.   (j) Employees and Employee Benefit Matters. \t
______________________________________   (1) SCHEDULE 3.1(j)(1) sets forth a
list of all employees employed by the Company as of the date set forth on
such Schedule by name, position or job title, rate of pay, date of
hire, seniority date (if different) and status, other than those employees
who will be transferred to employment with Seller or an Affiliate on or prior
to the Closing Date and who shall be separately identified by name and
position or job title on SCHEDULE 3.1(j)(1). The information set forth on
SCHEDULE 3.1(j)(1) shall be updated on or prior to the Closing Date
to include employees hired after the date hereof and delete employees who
are no longer employed by the Company as of the Closing Date. Each such
employee set forth on SCHEDULE 3.1(j)(1) as of the Closing Date, other than
those employees who will be transferred to employment with Seller or an
Affiliate on or prior to the Closing Date, is referred to herein as a
"Company Employee."   (2) Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 3.1(j)(2),
with respect to the Company Employees, (i) neither the Company nor Seller is
a party to any labor or collective bargaining agreement with respect to the
Company Employees and, to the knowledge of Seller, with respect to any
Company Employees not currently covered by any labor or collective bargaining
agreement, there are no efforts to organize such Company Employees; (ii)
there are no strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns; (iii) there are no
unfair labor practice charges or grievances under any collective bargaining

employment of any current or former employee of the Company or the terms or
conditions of the employment of any current or former employee of the
Company; and (vi) to the knowledge of Seller, the Company is currently in
material compliance with all applicable Laws relating to employment
and employment practices.   (3) SCHEDULE 3.1(j)(3) sets forth a list
identifying each "employee welfare benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(1)
of ERISA, each "employee pension benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(2)
of ERISA, and each other plan or arrangement providing for insurance coverage
(including any self-insured arrangements), severance, workers\' compensation,
disability benefits, fringe benefits, supplemental unemployment
benefits, vacation benefits, retirement benefits, deferred
compensation, profit sharing, bonuses, stock options, stock
appreciation rights, stock purchase or other forms of incentive
compensation or post-retirement insurance, compensation, or benefits which
is maintained, administered, or contributed to by Seller, the Company or any
of their ERISA Affiliates and which covers any current or former employee,
director, officer or independent contractor of the Company or under which the
Company has or will have any liability. Such plans are referred to in this
Section as the  \t\t\t\t16   "Employee Plans." Seller has made available
to Buyer accurate and complete copies of (i) each Employee Plan,
including the plan document, trust agreements (or other
funding arrangements) and amendments, (ii) the most recent annual
report (Form 5500 including all schedules thereto) prepared in connection
with any Employee Plan required to file such report and the most recent
financial statements and listing of plan assets for any Employee Plan
required to maintain such statements, (iii) the most recent actuarial
valuation report prepared in connection with any Employee Plan required
to maintain such report, and (iv) the latest Internal Revenue Service
determination letter obtained with respect to each Employee Plan intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) or 501(a) of the Code. For purposes of this
subsection and Section 6.1, an "ERISA Affiliate" of any Person means any
other Person which, together with such Person, would be treated as a
single employer under Section 414 of the Code. The Company is
a participating employer in the Employee Plans, but does not sponsor any of
such plans, and the Company will not have any obligation, liability, or
responsibility with respect to any of the Employee Plans on or after the
Closing Date. Neither the Seller, the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has
made any contract, plan or commitment to create any additional plan or
to modify any existing Employee Plan with respect to the
Company Employees.   (4) Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 3.1(j)(4),
no Employee Plan (i) constitutes a "multiemployer plan," as defined
in Section 3(37) of ERISA (for purposes of this Section, a "Multiemployer
Plan"), (ii) is maintained in connection with a trust described in Section
501(c)(9) of the Code or welfare benefit fund described in Section 419 of the
Code, or (iii) is subject to Title IV of ERISA or to the minimum funding
standards of ERISA or the Code. Neither Seller, the Company nor any of their
ERISA Affiliates has incurred any material liability under Title IV of ERISA
arising in connection with the termination of, or complete or partial
withdrawal from, any plan covered or previously covered by Title IV of ERISA.
Neither Seller, the Company, nor any ERISA Affiliate has withdrawal liability
under any Multiemployer Plan.   (5) There are no accumulated funding
deficiencies as defined in Section 412 of the Code (whether or not waived)
with respect to any Employee Plan. As of the date of the last
completed ERISA annual actuarial funding valuation report prepared in
compliance with applicable regulations for a defined benefit pension
plan, the fair market value of the assets held with respect to each such
Employee Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan," as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA, exceeded the actuarially determined present value of
all benefit liabilities accrued under such Employee Plan (whether or not
vested) determined using reasonable actuarial assumptions. Seller, the
Company and their ERISA Affiliates have paid and discharged promptly when due
all liabilities and obligations arising under ERISA or the Code of
a character which if unpaid or unperformed might result in the imposition of
a lien against any of the assets of the Company.   (6) Each Employee Plan
that is intended to be qualified under Section 401 of the Code is so
qualified and has been so qualified since the date of its adoption and each
trust forming a part thereof is exempt from tax pursuant to Section 501(a) of
the Code, and either (i) has received a favorable determination letter from
the Internal Revenue Service to such effect or (ii) is still within the
"remedial amendment period," as defined in Section 401(b) of the Code and the
regulations thereunder.   (7) Each Employee Plan has been maintained in
all material respects in accordance with its terms and with the
requirements prescribed by all applicable Laws, including but not limited
to ERISA and the Code.  \t\t\t\t17    (8) Neither the Company nor any of
its directors, officers, employees or agents has, with respect to any
Employee Plan, engaged in or been a party to any "prohibited transaction,"
as such term is defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA,
which could result in the imposition of a material penalty assessed pursuant
to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed by Section 4975 of the
Code.  \t (9) Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 3.1(j)(9), neither Seller,
the Company nor any of their ERISA Affiliates provides post- retirement
medical, health or life coverage or contributes to any employee welfare
benefit plan that provides for medical, health or life benefit coverage
following termination of employment except as is required by Section 4980B of
the Code.   (10) There are no pending claims, suits or other proceedings,
or, to the knowledge of Seller, any threatened claims, suits or other
proceedings, by any employees, former employees or plan participants or the
beneficiaries, spouses or representatives of any of them, against any
Employee Plan, the assets held thereunder, the trustee of any such assets, or
the Company relating to the Employee Plans, other than ordinary and
usual claims for benefits by participants or beneficiaries. There has been
no "mass layoff" or "plant closing" as defined by WARN by the Company within
six months prior to the Closing Date.  \t (11) Neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Seller nor the consummation of the transaction
contemplated hereby will result in the acceleration or creation of any
rights of any person to benefits under any of the Employee Plans (other than
the acceleration of vesting under the Seller DB Plans and the Seller DC
Plans) or in the creation of rights under any severance, parachute or change
of control agreement such that any such person shall have greater rights
under any such Employee Plan than if this Agreement was not consummated.  
(k) No Brokers or Finders. \t _____________________   No agent, broker,
finder, or investment or commercial banker, or other Person or firm engaged
by or acting on behalf of Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, is or will be entitled to
any broker\'s or finder\'s or similar fee or other commission arising in
connection with this Agreement or such transactions.   (l) Operation in the
Ordinary Course. \t ________________________________   Except as set forth
on SCHEDULE 3.1(l), since December 31, 2002, the Company has operated the
Business in the ordinary course and in all material respects in accordance
with past practice.   (m) Environmental Compliance.

or will constitute, legally valid and binding obligations of Buyer,
enforceable against Buyer in accordance with their respective terms except

other similar laws and equitable principles relating to or limiting
creditors\' rights generally. Except for any filings or approvals required
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, the execution, delivery and performance of

or constitute a breach or default (whether upon lapse of time and/or the
occurrence of any act or event or otherwise) under the charter
documents  \t\t\t\t22   or by-laws of Buyer or any Contract to which
Buyer is a party, (ii) result in the imposition of any Lien against any
assets or properties of Buyer, (iii) violate any Law, or (iv) require
any Approvals to be obtained.   (c) Actions. \t _______   There is no
Order or Action pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened against or
affecting Buyer that individually or when aggregated with one or more other
Orders or Actions has or could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Buyer\'s ability to perform this Agreement or the
Supply Contract.   (d) Compliance with Law. \t ___________________

given in writing by either of Buyer\'s Representatives. The time periods
within which Buyer\'s Representatives must respond shall commence on the
date on which either of Buyer\'s Representatives receives a written request
for consent.   4.3 Efforts; No Inconsistent Action. 
____________________________________   (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to cause the conditions to each other\'s obligation to
close the transactions contemplated hereby as set forth in Article VIII to
be satisfied. In addition, each of Buyer and Seller will be given notice of
and a reasonable opportunity to participate in contacts with any Governmental
Entity regarding antitrust or merger control matters. Buyer and Seller shall
cooperate with each other to the extent reasonable in connection with
the foregoing.   (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, Buyer and Seller shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to file Notification and Report Forms under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and
similar applications with any other applicable Governmental Entity whose
Approval is required in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable following the date
hereof and in any event no later than five days following the date hereof.
Buyer and Seller shall cooperate and use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any Approvals required for the Closing
(including through compliance with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act), to respond to
any requests for information from a Governmental Entity, and to contest and
resist any Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that restricts, prevents
or prohibits the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to require Buyer to dispose of or make any change in any
material portion of its existing business to obtain any Approval (it
being understood that the operations of the Newberry, Florida facility are a
material portion of Buyer\'s existing business). Buyer agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to secure clearance under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, including
agreeing to such non- material amendments of this Agreement as requested by
either the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice in order
to facilitate such approval process. To the extent permitted by applicable
Law, Buyer and Seller shall provide the other the opportunity to make copies
of all material correspondence, filings or communications (or memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between such party or its
representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity, on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except for documents filed pursuant to Item 4(c) of the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Notification and Report Form or communications regarding the
same or documents or information submitted in response to
any  \t\t\t\t26   request for additional information or documents
pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act which reveal Seller\'s or Buyer\'s
negotiating objectives or strategies or purchase price expectations. Buyer
and Seller acknowledge that all such information provided pursuant to the
foregoing sentence shall be subject to the mutual nondisclosure obligations
of the Confidentiality Agreement.   (c) Buyer and Seller shall notify and
keep the other advised as to (i) any material communication from the Federal
Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity
regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) any Action
pending and known to such Party or, to its knowledge, threatened, which
challenges the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer and Seller shall not
take any action inconsistent with their obligations under this Agreement
that would materially hinder or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (d) Prior to the Closing, the Parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (and cooperate with the
other Party hereto in obtaining) all consents, permits,
authorizations, approvals of, and exemptions by, any third party necessary
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that neither Party shall have any obligation to give any
guarantee or other consideration of any nature (other than transfer or filing
fees established by the terms of any Law or Permit) in connection with the
receipt of any waiver, consent, approval or authorization.   (e) All
documents required to be filed by any of the Parties or any of their
respective Subsidiaries with any Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will comply in
all material respects with the provisions of applicable Law.   4.4
Supplemental Disclosure.  ____________________________   Seller shall
promptly supplement or amend any Schedule with respect to any matter that
arises in the period after the date of this Agreement and before the Closing
Date and which is required to be set forth or described in the
Disclosure Schedules. Any such supplemental disclosure will be deemed
to have cured any breach of any representation or warranty made in this
Agreement if the Closing occurs (it being understood that the consummation of
the Closing will be deemed to constitute a waiver of any such breach), but
will not be deemed to have been disclosed as of the date of this Agreement
for purposes of determining whether or not the conditions set forth in
Section 8.2 hereof have been satisfied or if the Closing does not
occur. Supplemental disclosure shall, in the aggregate, taken together with
the Schedules accompanying this Agreement when first executed (the "Original
Schedules"), not disclose any state of affairs having a Material Adverse
Effect not disclosed on the Original Schedules.   4.5 Elimination of
Intercompany and Affiliate Liabilities. 
__________________________________________________________   Prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall purchase, cause to be repaid or assume liability
for (a) any and all loans or other extensions of credit made or guaranteed by
the Company to or for the benefit of any director, officer or employee of
Seller who remains a director, officer or employee of Seller after
the Closing Date and (b) any and all loans, banking guarantees or other
extensions of credit of any amount made to or for the benefit of Seller or
any Affiliate of Seller, except as to clauses (a) and (b) above as set forth
on SCHEDULE 4.5. Prior to the  \t\t\t\t27   Closing Date, the principal
amount of any intercompany loans payable by or to the Company shall be
cancelled.   4.6 Notice of Developments. \t ___________________________  
Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, each Party shall promptly
notify the other Party in writing if it obtains "knowledge" (as contemplated
in Section 12.12) of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that has
caused any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to
be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect.   4.7 Assignment of
Certain Trademarks.  _____________________________________   On or prior to
the Closing Date, Seller shall assign to Company (a) the entire right, title,
and interest throughout the world in and to the trademarks identified in
SCHEDULE 4.7, including the goodwill of the business in connection with
which the marks have been used, to be held and enjoyed by Company for its
own use and benefit and for the use and benefit of its parents, subsidiaries,
licensees, successors and assigns; and (b) the right to sue for past
infringement, dilution, and any other violation of rights in connection with
such trademarks. Any and all recoveries from any suit or settlements in
connection therewith shall belong exclusively to the Company. At
the Company\'s reasonable request, Seller agrees to provide
reasonable cooperation and assistance to Company in connection with any
such action. On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to the
Company a fully executed and notarized copy of each assignment agreement in
the form attached as EXHIBIT C.   4.8 Exclusivity.  ________________  
Seller will not (and Seller will cause the Company not to) (i) solicit,
initiate or encourage the submission of any proposal or offer from any Person
relating to the acquisition of any capital stock or other voting securities,
or any substantial portion of the assets, of the Company (including any
acquisition structured as a merger, consolidation, or share exchange) or
(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish any
information with respect to, assist or participate in, or facilitate in any
other manner any effort or attempt by any Person to do or seek any of the
foregoing.  \t\t\t\t28     4.9 Alternative Real Estate Transfers. \t
______________________________________   At Buyer\'s request, Seller will
transfer the Tampa Grinding Facility directly to Buyer or its designee.
For purposes of the representations and warranties and the rights of the
Parties post-Closing under this Agreement, the Tampa Grinding Site will be
treated as if it had been transferred from Seller to the Company prior to the
Closing rather than from Seller to Buyer or its designee, it being
acknowledged that the transfer of the Tampa Grinding Facility directly to
Buyer or its designee shall not be deemed to modify the provisions of Article
VIII hereof. Any costs and expenses associated with transferring the
Tampa Grinding Facility directly to Buyer or its designee shall be borne by
Buyer to the extent that such costs and expenses would not otherwise be
incurred if the Tampa Grinding Site were transferred from Seller to the
Company. In the event that either Party elects to transfer the Tampa Grinding
Site pursuant to a like kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Code, the
Party not engaging in the like kind exchange shall indemnify the other Party
for any costs and expenses incurred by such Party as a result of structuring
the transfer as a like kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Code.   4.10
Industrial Revenue Bonds. \t _____________________________   Prior to the
Closing, Seller shall, as directed by Buyer, deposit money with either (i)
the trustee under the indenture relating to the industrial revenue bonds
issued by Hillsborough County that are secured by cement
unloading facilities at the Tampa Grinding Site (the "IRB Indenture")
or (ii) the title company issuing title insurance to Buyer with respect to
the Tampa Grinding Site, sufficient to pay any amounts required to pay all
principal and accrued interest with respect to such bonds through the first
date on which prepayment of such bonds can be made. It is the intent of the
Parties that Seller shall satisfy the obligations under the IRB Indenture. As
such, Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from any obligations
arising under the IRB Indenture (it being acknowledged that such bonds will
not be repaid, and the Liens related to such bonds will not be released,
until such bonds are repaid after the Closing).   4.11 Manatee County Port
Authority.  __________________________________   Promptly following
execution of this Agreement, at the request of Buyer, Seller shall arrange
for a meeting between Seller, Buyer and representatives of the Manatee County
Port Authority in order to introduce Buyer to such representatives of the
Manatee County Port Authority and to permit Buyer to make reasonable
inquiries of such representatives regarding the relationship between the
Company and the Manatee County Port Authority.   ARTICLE V  CONTINUING

result of or otherwise related to Seller\'s prior ownership of the Company,
whether or not related to this Agreement, including any assets, liabilities
or other matters related to the Company that are retained by Seller
(including Seller\'s indemnification obligations under Section 11.1(c))
and any claims made by or against Seller or any of its Affiliates, whether
involving any Governmental Entity or third party or for the purpose of

the Property, (ii) assisting Seller in connection with any
Actions, including preparation for any Actions such as
discovery, depositions and similar activities, and (iii) the right to
make and retain copies of all pertinent documents and records relating to
any such matters. Buyer\'s obligations under this Section 5.1 are in addition
to Buyer\'s other obligations to cooperate with Seller contained in this
Agreement.   (c) Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that all attorney-
client, work product and other legal privileges that may exist with respect
to the Company related to third party claims as to which an indemnification
claim has been made under Article XI shall, from and after the Closing Date,
be deemed to be joint privileges of Seller and Buyer. Both Seller and Buyer
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts after the Closing Date
to preserve all such privileges and neither Seller nor Buyer shall knowingly
waive any such privilege without the prior written consent of the other party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).   (d) Buyer

the Closing Date, upon Buyer\'s request (at Buyer\'s expense) and without
necessity of subpoena, Seller will provide, or will cause to be provided,
reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice to
Seller and its Affiliates\' employees (i) to assist Buyer in connection with
any Actions relating to Seller\'s prior ownership of the Company, including
in connection with preparation for any Actions such as discovery, depositions
and similar activities and (ii) to answer questions of Buyer regarding the
Company and the Business or provide information within their control to Buyer
regarding the Company and the Business; provided that nothing herein
shall require any such Persons to provide information to Buyer that does not
relate exclusively to the Business or the Company.   5.2 Post-Closing
Operations.  ____________________________   Buyer acknowledges that it is
an experienced and knowledgeable owner and operator of facilities and assets
similar to the Business and will rely on its own expertise in conducting the
Business from and after the Closing. Buyer covenants for the benefit of
Seller to conduct the Business in material compliance with all applicable
Laws from and after the Closing.   5.3 Use of Certain Seller Trademarks. \t
_____________________________________   (a) Subject to the terms of this
Section 5.3, Seller hereby grants to Buyer a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
non- sublicenseable right to use the trademarks set forth on SCHEDULE 5.3
(the "Seller Marks"). Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, other than as
provided for in this Section 5.3, it is not obtaining any rights or licenses
with respect to any name, marks, logo, trade dress or design owned by Seller
or its Affiliates. Buyer shall cease and shall cause the Company to cease any
and all use of the Seller Marks as soon as practicable after the Closing
Date, but not more than thirty days after the Closing Date; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that with respect to  \t\t\t\t30   stationery, contracts,
purchase orders, agreements and other business forms and writings which could
result after the Closing Date in a legal commitment of Seller or any of its
Affiliates, Buyer shall cease and shall cause the Company to cease within ten
Business Days after the Closing Date any use of the Seller Marks.   (b)
Buyer may use the Seller Marks for the time period provided in Section 5.3(a)
but only to the extent and in the manner used by the Company in connection
with the Business as operated by the Company immediately prior to the Closing
Date and any such use shall be in accordance with all applicable Laws,
conform to at least the standards of quality prevailing in the Business as
of the date hereof, and not be offensive, disparaging or misleading as to
the origin or quality of the services provided in the Business. Any such use
shall also be subject to Seller\'s trademark quality control and usage
guidelines then in effect. In no event may Buyer use the Seller Marks,
directly or indirectly, in any way that would jeopardize, dilute or
otherwise adversely affect the Seller Marks and Buyer shall not
attack, dispute or challenge (nor aid or encourage others to do
so) Seller\'s exclusive right, title and interest in and to the
Seller Marks, or the validity of the Seller Marks.   (c) As soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any event not later than ninety days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Company to change its corporate, popular,
fictitious business, trade and domain names and any similar designations
to new names that do not include a Seller Mark and are not similar in
appearance, sound or commercial impression to a Seller Mark and thereafter
shall not use and shall cause the Company not to use or include any of the
Seller Marks or a name similar in appearance, sound or commercial impression
to a Seller Mark as or in its corporate, popular, fictitious business, trade
or domain name or in any similar designation.   (d) Subject to the
provisions of Sections 5.3(a) and (b) above, Buyer agrees, on behalf of
itself and its Subsidiaries, not to use or seek to register any trade name,
service mark, trademark or domain name that contains or is similar in
appearance, sound or commercial impression to any of the Seller Marks.
Buyer agrees, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, that it will never
directly or indirectly challenge, contest or call into question or raise any
questions concerning the validity or ownership by Seller of any Seller Mark,
any registration or application for registration of any Seller Mark or any
domain name application or registration containing any Seller Mark. Buyer
agrees that nothing herein shall give Buyer or the Company any right to or
interest in any Seller Mark except the right to use the same in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, and that any and all uses of the Seller
Marks by Buyer or the Company and all goodwill arising therefrom shall inure
to the benefit of Seller.   5.4 Use of Certain Seller Patents 
__________________________________   (a) Subject to the terms of this
Section 5.4, Seller hereby grants to Buyer a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
non- sublicenseable, royalty-free right under the patents set forth
on SCHEDULE 3.1(t) (the "Seller Patents"), solely in connection
with operating, repairing and replacing the dust collection system
and apparatus for automatically placing bags at the Tampa Grinding Site or
Port Manatee Site, until the expiration of the Seller Patents. Without
limiting the foregoing, Buyer may only use the methods covered by the Seller
Patents at the Tampa Grinding Site and the Port Manatee Site (or to any site
in the same geographic region to which the Company\'s facilities may be
relocated after the Closing in connection with the closing of an
existing facility) and only to the extent and in the manner used by
the Company in connection with the Business as operated by the Company
immediately prior to the Closing Date in accordance with all applicable Laws.
In no event may Buyer use the Seller Patents, directly
or  \t\t\t\t31   indirectly, in any way that would jeopardize, dilute or
otherwise adversely affect the Seller Patents and Buyer shall not
attack, dispute or challenge (nor aid or encourage others to do so)
Seller\'s exclusive right, title and interest in and to the Seller
Patents or the validity of the Seller Patents. The Company may transfer the
license granted hereunder or issue a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-
sublicenseable, royalty-free sublicense to any Person that acquires
substantially all the assets of the Tampa Grinding Site or the Port Manatee
Site.   (b) If Buyer commits any material breach of any of its obligations
under this Section 5.4, Seller shall give Buyer written notice of such
breach, specifying the nature of the breach. If within thirty (30) days from
receipt of such notice Buyer has not cured such breach, Seller may terminate
the license granted under this Section 5.4 upon ten (10) days\' written
notice to Buyer.   (c) If any Party believes there has been any third
party infringement related to the Seller Patents, such Party
shall immediately notify the other Party and provide such information as is
available to confirm such infringing activity. Seller shall have the right
(but not the obligation) to take any action that it deems appropriate to
terminate the infringing activity (including the initiation of legal
proceedings, settlement discussions and/or sublicense negotiations), in which
case Buyer shall provide Seller with all reasonable assistance in
connection therewith (including being joined as a named party in any
legal proceeding). Any damages received by Seller, Buyer or the Company in
connection with any such actions shall be for the benefit of Seller and, to
the extent not paid directly to Seller, shall be remitted promptly to
Seller.   5.5 Acknowledgment of Limitation of Warranties.

Company, nor the directors, officers, and employees of the Company (including
the Company Employees) will be covered under any property/casualty insurance
policies (including workers\' compensation policies) maintained by Seller or
its Affiliates.   5.7 Noncompetition and Nonsolicitation \t
_______________________________________   (a) Seller hereby agrees that for
the period beginning as of the Closing Date and continuing up to and
including the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Noncompete
Period"), Seller shall not, and shall not cause or permit any of its
Affiliates to, (i) engage in a Competing Business in the Territory or
(ii) have any direct or indirect interest, whether as an investor, lender,
partner, stockholder, trustee or consultant, in, or provide substantial
assistance to, any corporation, partnership or other business entity or
enterprise (wherever located) which engages in a Competing Business in the
Territory; provided that in the event the Option is not exercised nothing
herein shall, for the avoidance of doubt, restrict the ownership of the
Tampa Terminal Facility by Seller or any of its Affiliates or the operation
of the Tampa Terminal Facility by any Person other than Seller or any of its
Affiliates; and provided further that nothing herein shall restrict the
ability of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries from engaging in the following
activities during the Noncompete Period:   (1) sales of Portland cement and
slag into the Territory from the terminal located in Jacksonville, Florida,
in an amount not to exceed 25,000 short tons in the first year of
the Noncompete Period, 25,000 short tons in the second year of
the Noncompete Period, 50,000 short tons in the third year of the Noncompete
Period, 50,000 short tons in the fourth year of the Noncompete Period or
75,000 short tons in the fifth year of the Noncompete Period; or   (2) the

indirectly, is the beneficial owner of not more than five percent (5%) of
such Person\'s outstanding capital stock or other equity interests, so long
as Seller does not control such Person; or  \t\t\t\t33    (3) the
acquisition and continued operation of any Person or assets or business
(wherever located) which conducts, participates or engages in, or owns or has

of the Closing Date (the "Nonsolicitation Period"), Seller shall not, and
shall not cause or permit any of its Subsidiaries or their executive officers
to, solicit for employment with Seller or any of its Subsidiaries any Person
then employed by the Company or Buyer and who was also employed by the
Company or Buyer on the Closing Date; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not restrict or preclude Seller or its Subsidiaries or their executive
officers from making generalized searches for employees by use of
advertisements in the media (including trade media and the internet) or by
engaging search firms which are not focused on employees of the Company or
Buyer.   (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.7 to the contrary,
if at any time a court holds that the restrictions stated in Section 5.7(a)
or Section 5.7(b) are unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable under
circumstances then existing, the Parties agree that the maximum period, scope
or geographical area determined to be reasonable under such circumstances by
such court will be substituted for the stated period, scope or area. Seller
acknowledges and agrees that money damages may not be an adequate remedy for
any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of Section 5.7(a) or
Section 5.7(b) and that, in such event, Buyer or its successors or assigns
may, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor,
apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for specific
performance, injunctive and/or other relief in order to enforce or prevent
any violations of the provisions of this Section 5.7). Any injunction shall
be available without the posting of any bond or other security. In the event
of a violation by Seller of any of the provisions of this Section 5.7 (as
finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Noncompete
Period or Nonsolicitation Period, as the case may be, will be tolled
until such violation ceases. Seller agrees that the restrictions contained
in this Section 5.7 are reasonable in all respects.   5.8 Certain Bagging
Arrangements \t _________________________________   During the period
beginning as of the Closing Date and continuing up to and including the
second anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall not cause
or permit any of its Subsidiaries to (i) sell Portland cement (Type I or
Type II) in Miami-Dade County in bag form or (ii) enter into any arrangement
with Rinker Group Limited or any of its Subsidiaries (a "Rinker Entity") to
have a Rinker Entity sell, in Miami-Dade County, Portland cement (Type I or
Type II) manufactured by a Rinker Entity using bags that employ a trademark
or tradename with the name `Lafarge\' on it; provided that the foregoing
shall not limit any operations of Seller or its Subsidiaries in the event
that Seller or one of its Subsidiaries acquires all or part of any Rinker
Entity that sells Portland cement in Miami-Dade County.   5.9 Financial
Statements \t _________________________   Upon Buyer\'s request, Seller
shall, and shall cause its independent accountants to, reasonably cooperate
with Buyer and the Company (and Buyer\'s independent accountants and
internal accountants) in the preparation of any audited financial statements
of the Company for any annual period, and unaudited financial statements of
the Company for any interim period, ending on or after the Closing Date but
including any annual or interim periods commencing before the Closing Date,
it being acknowledged that the cost of the accounting firm preparing
and certifying such financial statements shall be borne by
Buyer.  \t\t\t\t34    5.10 Option to Purchase Tampa Terminal Facility 
_______________________________________________   (a) Seller hereby grants
to Buyer an irrevocable option (the "Option") to purchase the Tampa Terminal
Facility. The Option shall be exercisable at any time between the Closing
Date until and including the sixtieth day after the Closing Date. From
the date hereof until the end of the period during which the Option is
exercisable, Seller shall not directly or indirectly sell, assign, transfer,
pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract with
respect to the sale, assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition of, of
the Tampa Terminal Facility. The Option shall be exercisable for an exercise
price of U.S.$10.00 (the "Exercise Price"). The Option may be exercised on
only one occasion. The exercise of the Option shall be effected by Buyer
executing and delivering to Seller a notice indicating its desire to exercise
the Option, which notice shall indicate the date, time and place of the
closing, which shall be no less than five (5) Business Days nor more than ten
(10) Business Days after the date such notice is received by Seller. At the
closing of the purchase of the Tampa Terminal Facility, Buyer will pay to
Seller in immediately available funds an amount equal to the Exercise Price.
Simultaneously with the delivery of the Exercise Price, Seller will deliver
to Buyer or its designee a special warranty deed with respect to the Tampa
Terminal Facility conveying the Tampa Terminal Facility to Buyer or
its designee free and clear of Liens securing indebtedness for borrowed
money.   (b) Buyer hereby acknowledges that the representations
and warranties of Seller in this Agreement do not relate, expressly or by
implication, to the Tampa Terminal Facility, which, for purposes of this
Agreement, is not part of the Business or the assets or liabilities of the
Company.   (c) Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that if the Option is
exercised, the Tampa Terminal Facility will be transferred "AS IS," "WHERE
IS" AND WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND OR NATURE WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, AND IN
PARTICULAR, WITHOUT ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION AS TO CONDITION,
VALUE, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS OR SUITABILITY FOR ANY SPECIFIC PURPOSE AS
TO THE TAMPA TERMINAL FACILITY.   (d) Subject to applicable Laws, Seller
shall authorize and permit Buyer and its representatives to have reasonable
access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice and in
such manner as will not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
the businesses of Seller or its Affiliates or the operations or functioning
of any systems located at the Tampa Terminal Facility, to the Tampa Terminal
Facility from and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (i)
the purchase of the Tampa Terminal Facility pursuant to the Option or (ii)
the expiration of the time period to exercise the Option. All requests for
access shall be made to such of Seller\'s representatives as Seller shall
designate, who shall be solely responsible for coordinating and shall
coordinate all such requests and all access permitted hereunder. Seller
reserves the right to condition such access on being afforded the right
to accompany Buyer or its representatives during its access to the Tampa
Terminal Facility. Subject to the foregoing, Buyer shall be entitled to
conduct or cause to be conducted (at its expense) such non-invasive
assessments, audits and tests and such structural and other physical
inspections as Buyer shall deem necessary or useful in connection with its
acquisition of the Tampa Terminal Facility. In conducting its testing
and inspection, Buyer and its representatives shall comply with
all applicable Laws, maintain customary and appropriate insurance coverage,
not unreasonably interfere in the conduct of the businesses of Seller or its
Affiliates and restore the property to its condition prior to such tests or
inspections. Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless
for  \t\t\t\t35   any losses incurred by Seller or its Affiliates,
arising out of the testing or inspection by Buyer and its representatives,
including the failure to comply with the immediately preceding sentence.  
ARTICLE VI  EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS \t
______________________________________   6.1 Employee and Employee Benefit
Matters.  __________________________________________   (a) Effective as of
the Closing Date, the Company shall assume and be solely responsible for any
and all obligations of Seller under the collective bargaining agreement with
Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers (PACE) International Union and
Local 3-0130 (the "Union"), which covers those Company Employees represented
by the Union; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section
6.1(a) shall be deemed to limit the representations and warranties of Seller
in Article III hereof.   (b) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall establish or make available (i) for those Company Employees who
are represented by the Union, a defined benefit pension plan (the "Buyer DB
Plan") that is substantially similar to the Lafarge North America Inc.
Pension Plan for Hourly Compensated Employees (Tampa) (the "Seller DB Plan")
and a defined contribution plan (the "Buyer Union DC Plan") as required
pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement with the Union (the "Seller
DC Plan"), and (ii) for those Company Employees who are not represented by
the Union, a defined contribution plan that provides benefits that are
substantially similar to those benefits provided to employees of the Buyer
and its Affiliates under the Florida Rock Industries, Inc. Profit Sharing
and Deferred Earnings Plan or such other defined contribution plan of Buyer,
the Company or its Affiliates that provides benefits to similarly situated
employees of the Buyer and its Affiliates (the "Buyer DC Plan"). The Buyer DB
Plan and the Buyer Union DC Plan shall provide service credit to each Company
Employee represented by the Union equal to the service that was credited to
the Company Employee under the Seller DB Plan or Seller DC Plan,
as applicable, for purposes of eligibility, vesting, level of benefits, and
benefit accrual; provided, however, that benefits accrued for each Company
Employee under the Buyer DB Plan shall be reduced by the benefits accrued as
of the Closing Date for such Company Employee under the Seller DB Plan.
Seller shall provide to Buyer within 60 days following the Closing Date
a schedule of benefits accrued by the Company Employees as of the Closing
Date under the Seller DB Plan, which schedule shall comply with the terms of
the collective bargaining agreement as of the Closing Date. The Buyer DC Plan
shall provide service credit to each Company Employee equal to the service
that was credited to the Company Employee under the Lafarge North
America Inc. Thrift Savings Plan for purposes of eligibility and
vesting. Buyer agrees to provide or cause the Company to provide on
an annual basis to each Company Employee listed on SCHEDULE
6.1(b) completing a full year of employment a profit sharing contribution or
substantially similar benefit that, when combined with the discretionary
profit sharing contribution that is made for such employee under a tax-
qualified defined contribution plan of the Buyer or an ERISA Affiliate, is
equal to at least 14 percent of such Company Employee\'s total compensation
during each year of employment with the Company or its Affiliates.
Seller agrees to provide Buyer with such information as may be reasonably
necessary to determine the service to be credited to the Company Employees in
accordance with this Section 6.1(b). Seller shall take all such action as may
be necessary and appropriate to fully vest the Company Employees in their
accrued benefits under the Seller DB Plan and the Lafarge North America Inc.
Retirement Plan and their account balances under the Seller DC Plans as of
the Closing Date.  \t\t\t\t36    (c) With respect to those Company
Employees not represented by the Union, for a period of one year following
the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide or cause the Company to provide each
such Company Employee with an annual salary or hourly wage that is at least
equal to such employee\'s annual salary or hourly wage with the Company
immediately prior to the Closing Date, which annual salary or hourly wage is
set forth on SCHEDULE 3.1(j)(1), and, except as provided in Section 6.1(b),
with employee benefit plans, programs and policies and fringe benefits that
are substantially comparable to those employee benefit plans, programs and
policies and fringe benefits that the Buyer provides to similarly situated
employees. With respect to those Company Employees represented by the Union,
the wages, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment shall be
governed by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement covering such
employees. Effective as of the Closing Date, all Company Employees
shall cease to participate in and accrue benefits under Seller\'s and its
ERISA Affiliates\' Employee Plans. Except as provided in Sections 6.1(b) and
6.1(c) or in any collective bargaining agreement, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to limit Buyer\'s right to terminate any Company
Employee in Buyer\'s discretion at any time or alter the terms and conditions
of employment of any Company Employee; provided, however, that the Company
shall not involuntarily terminate the employment of any of the Company
Employees not represented by the Union for at least six months after the
Closing Date, except for cause.   (d) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall cause the service of each Company Employee with the Company and its
ERISA Affiliates prior to the Closing Date to be recognized for purposes of
eligibility, vesting, level of benefits, and benefit accrual (including level
of benefits and benefit accrual under any vacation and severance pay plans,
policies or arrangements), under each compensation, vacation, fringe or other
welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement of Buyer, the Company or any of
their ERISA Affiliates (collectively, the "Company Benefit Plans") in which
any Company Employee is or becomes eligible to participate. From and after
the Closing Date, with respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is an
"employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA in which
any Company Employee is or becomes eligible to participate, Buyer shall
cause each such Company Benefit Plan to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-
existing conditions, waiting periods and exclusions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable under such Company Benefit
Plan to the same extent that such pre- existing conditions, waiting periods
and exclusions would not have applied or would have been waived under the
corresponding Employee Plan in which such Company Employee was a
participant immediately prior to his commencement of participation in
such Company Benefit Plan and (ii) provide each Company Employee with credit
for any co-payments and deductibles paid by such Company Employee in the plan
year in which the Closing occurs in satisfying any applicable co-payment or
deductible requirements under such Company Benefit Plan for the applicable
plan year.   (e) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date,
with respect to each Company Employee who is a participant in a Seller DC
Plan, Seller shall (i) provide each such employee with the right to receive a
distribution of such employee\'s vested interest under the applicable Seller
DC Plan and an election to roll over such employee\'s vested interest in the
applicable Seller DC Plan to a Buyer DC Plan in accordance with Section
402 of the Code, and (ii) cause the trustee of the applicable Seller DC Plan
to roll over the vested interest which the Company Employee elects to roll
over to a Buyer DC Plan. Buyer shall take or cause the Company to take all
such action as may be necessary or appropriate (including amending the Buyer
DC Plans if necessary) to permit the Company Employees to roll over
their vested interests in the Seller DC Plans to a Buyer DC Plan. Buyer will
cooperate or cause the Company to cooperate with Seller in providing
information to the Company Employees regarding rollovers of their interests
from the applicable Seller DC Plan to a Buyer DC Plan.  \t\t\t\t37   
(f) Seller\'s welfare benefit plans applicable to the Company Employees shall
be responsible for all claims incurred by the Company Employees prior to the
Closing Date. The Company Benefit Plans applicable to the Company Employees
shall be responsible for all claims incurred by the Company Employees on and
after the Closing Date. A claim shall be deemed to have been incurred
when the medical or other service giving rise to the claim is performed,
except that in the case of death, a claim shall be deemed to have been
incurred on the date of death and in the case of disability, with the first
occurrence of the injury or illness resulting in the disability. The Company
Employees receiving disability benefits as of the Closing Date shall continue
to receive benefits from plans sponsored by Seller while the disability
continues or until their eligibility otherwise expires as provided in such
plans.   (g) Buyer shall be responsible and liable for providing
the appropriate notices and "continuation coverage" benefits on or after the
Closing Date under Buyer\'s group health plans to all Company Employees and
"qualified beneficiaries" of those employees, for whom a "qualifying event"
occurs on or after the Closing Date. Seller shall be responsible and liable
for providing the appropriate notices and "continuation coverage" benefits
under Seller\'s group health plans (i) for any "qualifying event" which
occurs prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) to those employees of the Company
who will be transferred to employment with Seller or an Affiliate on or prior
to the Closing Date as separately identified on SCHEDULE 3.1(j)(1)
and "qualified beneficiaries" of such employees, for whom a "qualifying
event" occurs on or after the Closing Date. The terms "continuation
coverage," "qualified beneficiaries" and "qualifying event" shall have the
meaning ascribed to them under Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601
through 608 of ERISA and the regulations thereunder.   ARTICLE VII  TAX

Company) of any covenant or agreement under this Article VII. Buyer shall
hold the Seller Group harmless from and against, any loss, claim, liability,
expense, or other damage attributable to (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment

on or after the Closing Date for the Straddle Tax Period and (ii) any and all

transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any Law, which Taxes

the existence of an issue that could increase the liability for any Tax of
the other Party or any Affiliate thereof or require a payment
hereunder, such Party shall in good faith promptly give notice to such
other Party of such issue. The failure of a Party to give the
notice required under the immediately preceding sentence shall not relieve
such Party of its obligations under this Article VII except to the extent the
Party obligated to provide indemnification or its Affiliate is actually
materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice.   7.7 Audit
Matters.  __________________   The Party having the responsibility for
filing a Tax Return (the "Responsible Party") shall have
primary responsibility for conducting the audit of such Tax Return,

comment upon all submissions made in the course of such audits, appeals,
or litigation and to be present at, directly or by its representatives, all
conferences, meetings or   \t\t\t\t42   proceedings with any taxing
authority, and all appearances before any court, the subject matter of which
is or includes an item for which the Other Party could be liable under this
Agreement. In addition, if the disposition, resolution or compromise of
such audit or appeal will or might reasonably be expected to result in the
Other Party having an increased Tax liability, or any other adverse Tax
consequence, for any period beginning after the Closing Date, the Other Party
shall have the right, exercisable within ten days of its receipt of notice of
a proposed disposition of the audit or appeal, to veto the disposition
of any audit adjustment with respect to such periods, such veto not to be
unreasonably exercised. Each Party shall bear its own expenses of
participation in such audits, appeals, or litigation. If the Responsible
Party declines to defend any matter provided for in this Section 7.7, the

Responsible Party shall bear the Responsible Party\'s share of costs as
determined in this Section 7.7 in those actions.   7.8 Cooperation and

terminating party is not in material breach of its
representations, warranties or covenants set forth herein:   (a) MUTUAL
CONSENT. By mutual consent in writing of Buyer and Seller.   (b) CLOSING
NOT CONSUMMATED BY EARLIER DATE. By Seller or Buyer at any time after
September 15, 2003, if the Closing shall not have occurred by such date,
unless extended by mutual consent in writing of Buyer and Seller; provided,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(b) shall
not be available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under
this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Closing to occur by such date; and provided that the date referred to above

not in material breach of this Agreement in the event the waiting period

CONDITIONS TO BUYER\'S PERFORMANCE NOT MET. By Buyer upon written notice to
Seller if any event occurs or condition exists which would render impossible
the satisfaction of one or more conditions to the obligations of Buyer to
consummate the Closing contemplated by this Agreement as set forth in Article
VIII; provided, however, that any such condition relating to a breach or a
failure to perform a representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
prior to the Closing Date shall be a cause for termination of this Agreement

respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents and
assigns from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses based upon
or arising from:   (a) any inaccuracy in any of the representations
and warranties made by Seller on the Closing Date in or pursuant to this
Agreement;   (b) any breach or nonperformance of any Pre-Closing Covenant
or any material breach or nonperformance of any of the covenants of Seller
contained in this Agreement (other than Pre-Closing Covenants), including any
matter as to which Seller in other provisions of this Agreement has expressly
agreed to indemnify Buyer or (subsequent to Closing) the Company; or   (c)
any of the matters specifically identified on SCHEDULE 11.1(c).   11.2
Obligations of Buyer. \t _________________________   Effective as of the
Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and each of its
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents and assigns from and
against any and all Indemnifiable Losses based upon or arising from:   (a)
any inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties made by Buyer on
the Closing Date in or pursuant to this Agreement;   (b) any breach or
nonperformance of any Pre-Closing Covenant or any material breach or
nonperformance of any of the covenants of Buyer contained in this Agreement
(other than Pre-Closing Covenants), including any matter as to which Buyer in
other provisions of this Agreement has expressly agreed to indemnify Seller;
or  \t\t\t\t49    (c) the conduct and operation of the Business on or
after the Closing, except to the extent that Seller would be obligated
to indemnify Buyer pursuant to the provisions of Section 11.1, without
regard to the limitations in Sections 11.4 and 11.5.   11.3 Procedure. \t
______________   The following procedures shall apply with respect
to indemnification claims:   (a) NOTICE OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS. Any Party
seeking indemnification of any Indemnifiable Loss or potential Indemnifiable
Loss arising from a claim asserted by a third party shall give written notice
to the Party from whom indemnification is sought. Written notice to the
Indemnifying Party of the existence of a third-party claim shall be given by
the Indemnified Party promptly after its receipt of an assertion
of liability from the third party, and in any event within ten days of such
assertion; provided, however, that the failure of the Indemnified Party to
give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its
obligations under this Article XI except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice.   (b) DEFENSE. In
the case of a third party claim, the Indemnifying Party may, at its option,
control the defense of an Indemnifiable Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain counsel of its choice
at its own expense and participate in the defense of the Indemnifiable Claim.
If the Indemnifying Party does not assume such defense or the Indemnifying
Party notifies the Indemnified Party within thirty days that it will not
assume such defense, the Indemnified Party may control the defense of such
claim and may settle the claim on behalf of and for the account and risk
of the Indemnifying Party, who shall be bound by the result. In all cases,
the party without the right to control the defense of the Indemnifiable Claim
may participate in the defense at its own expense.  \t (c) TAX ADJUSTMENTS.
Any amounts payable by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of an
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement shall be reduced by the amount
of any Tax benefits to the Indemnified Party as a result of the claim, loss
or damage involved, including any increased deductions, credits or losses of
the Indemnified Party. In the case of Tax benefits consisting of depreciation
or amortization deductions, the Tax benefit amount will be based on the net
present value of such deductions using a discount rate equal to the mid-term
applicable federal rate in effect on the day on which the indemnification
payments are due. Any Tax benefit calculations under this Section
11.3(c) shall be determined using the highest combined marginal Tax rate for
federal and applicable state and local income Taxes.   (d) SETTLEMENT
LIMITATIONS. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.3 to the contrary,
neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall, without the
written consent of the other party, settle or compromise any Indemnifiable
Claim or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment, unless
such settlement or compromise includes a complete release of the Indemnified
Party with respect to liability related to such Indemnifiable Claim.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if a settlement offer solely for
money damages is made by the applicable third party claimant, and the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing of the
Indemnifying Party\'s willingness to accept the settlement offer and pay
the amount called for by such offer without reservation of any rights or
defenses against the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may continue to
contest such claim, free of any participation by the Indemnifying Party, and
the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to such Indemnifiable Claim
that the Indemnifying Party has an obligation to pay hereunder shall be
limited to the lesser of (A) the amount of the settlement offer that
the Indemnified Party declined to accept plus the Indemnifiable Losses of
the Indemnified Party relating to such Indemnifiable  \t\t\t\t50   Claim
through the date of its rejection of the settlement offer or (B) the
aggregate Indemnifiable Losses of the Indemnified Party with respect to such
claim. If the Indemnifying Party makes any payment on any claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all
rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to any insurance benefits
or other claims of the Indemnified Party with respect to such claim.   11.4
Survival. \t _____________   The representations and warranties contained

and warranties contained in Sections 3.1(j) and 3.1(m) shall expire on the
fifth anniversary of the Closing, (ii) the representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.1(c) shall remain in full force and effect until the

remain in effect (a) with respect to Sections 11.1(a) and 11.2(a), so long as
the relevant representations and warranties survive, (b) with respect to
Sections 11.1(b) and 11.2(b) to the extent those Sections relate to the
covenants in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 and 4.6 requiring performance prior to
the Closing ("Pre-Closing Covenants"), for one year after the Closing, (c)
with respect to Sections 11.1(b) and 11.2(b) to the extent those Sections

applicable covenant survives, (d) with respect to Section 11.1(c), 185 days
after the Closing and (e) with respect to Section 11.2(c), indefinitely.
Any matter as to which a non-speculative claim has been asserted by written
notice setting forth in reasonable detail the nature of such claim to the
other Party that is pending, unresolved and being diligently pursued at the
end of any applicable limitation period shall continue to be covered by this
Article XI notwithstanding any applicable limitation period (which
the Parties hereby waive) until such matter is finally terminated, not being
diligently pursued or otherwise resolved by the Parties under this Agreement
or by a court of competent jurisdiction and any amounts payable hereunder are
finally determined and paid.   11.5 Limitations on Indemnification. \t
___________________________________   (a) Seller shall not be required to
indemnify any Person under Section 11.1(a), 11.1(c) or, solely with respect
to Pre-Closing Covenants, Section 11.1(b), unless (i) the amount for
which indemnity would otherwise be payable by Seller with respect to any
given claim (other than claims for breaches of any representation and
warranty that is specifically qualified by materiality) exceeds U.S.$25,000
("Included Claims") and (ii) the aggregate amount for all Included Claims
exceeds U.S.$1,000,000, and in such event, Seller shall be responsible for
only the amount in excess of U.S.$1,000,000. In no event shall the
total indemnification to be paid by Seller under this Article XI, exceed (i)
35% of the Purchase Price between the Closing Date and the first anniversary
of the Closing Date or (ii) 25% of the Purchase Price after the first
anniversary of the Closing Date; provided that the limitation set forth in
this sentence shall be 50% of the Purchase Price with respect to the matters
set forth in Section 11.1(c). The limitations set forth in this
Section 11.5(a) shall not be applicable to claims based on (i) breaches of
the representations and warranties in Section 3.1(a)(2) or 3.1(u)(2), (ii)
breach of the covenants in Article VII, or (iii) fraud.   (b) Buyer shall
not be required to indemnify any Person under Section 11.2(a) or, solely with
respect to Pre-Closing Covenants, Section 11.2(b), unless (i) the amount for
which indemnity would otherwise be payable by Buyer with respect to any
Included Claims  \t\t\t\t51   and (ii) the aggregate amount for all
Included Claims exceeds U.S.$1,000,000, and in such event, Buyer shall be
responsible for only the amount in excess of U.S.$1,000,000. In no event
shall the total indemnification to be paid by Buyer under this Article XI,
exceed (i) 35% of the Purchase Price between the Closing Date and the first
anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) 25% of the Purchase Price after the
first anniversary of the Closing Date. The limitations set forth in this
Section 11.5(b) shall not be applicable to claims based on (i) breaches of
any covenants with respect to payment of the Purchase Price or any portion
thereof, (ii) breaches of any covenants in Article VII or (iii) fraud.  
(c) Any Indemnifiable Claim with respect to any breach or nonperformance by
either Party of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall be
limited to the amount of actual Indemnifiable Losses sustained by the
Indemnified Party by reason of such breach or nonperformance, net of any
insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party and net Tax
benefits.   (d) If an inaccuracy in any of the representations
and warranties made by Seller or a breach of any covenants of Seller gives
rise to an adjustment in the Purchase Price, or otherwise was the basis for a
proposed adjustment to the Closing Date Statement, then such inaccuracy or
breach shall not give rise to an indemnification obligation under Section
11.1.   11.6 Treatment of Payments. \t __________________________   All
payments made pursuant to this Article XI shall be treated as adjustments to
the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Buyer shall not be indemnified or reimbursed for any tax
consequences arising from the receipt or accrual of an indemnity payment
hereunder, including any such consequences arising from adjustments to
the basis of any asset resulting from an adjustment to the Purchase Price or
any additional Taxes resulting from any such basis adjustment.   11.7
Remedies Exclusive. \t _______________________   Except as otherwise
provided in Article VII, the remedies provided for in this Article XI shall
be exclusive and shall preclude assertion by any Indemnified Party of any
other rights or the seeking of any and all other remedies against
the Indemnifying Party for claims based on this Agreement, except with
respect to claims based on fraud. In no event shall the mere breach of a
representation or warranty be used as evidence of or deemed to constitute bad
faith, misconduct or fraud. Each Party hereby waives any provision of Law to
the extent that it would limit or restrict the agreement contained in this
Section 11.7.   11.8 Mitigation. \t _______________   The Parties shall
cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim or liability
with respect to which one party is obligated to indemnify the other party
hereunder, including by making commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability. Each Party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to address any claims or liabilities
that may provide a basis for an Indemnifiable Claim such that each Party
shall respond to any claims or liabilities in the same manner it would
respond to such claims or liabilities in the absence of the indemnification
provisions of this Agreement. In the event that any party shall willfully
fail to make such commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any
claim or liability, then notwithstanding anything else to the contrary
contained herein, the other party shall  \t\t\t\t52   not be required to
indemnify any Person for any Indemnifiable Loss that could reasonably be
expected to have been avoided if such party, as the case may be, had made
such efforts.   ARTICLE XII  GENERAL \t\t\t ___________   12.1
Usage. \t __________   All terms defined herein have the meanings assigned

succession of comparable successor Laws and includes (in the case of
instruments) references to all attachments thereto and
instruments incorporated therein. References to a Person are, unless
the context otherwise requires, also to its successors and assigns. Any term
defined herein by reference to any instrument or Law has such meaning whether
or not such instrument or Law is in effect. "Shall" and "will" have equal
force and effect. "Hereof," "herein," "hereunder" and comparable terms refer

instance so provided.   12.3 Schedules; Exhibits. \t
________________________   Each Schedule and Exhibit delivered pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall constitute a part
of this Agreement, although the Disclosure Schedules need not be attached to
each copy of this Agreement. The mere inclusion of an item in a Schedule as
an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission
by Seller that such item represents an exception or material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Further, any fact or item which is clearly disclosed on any
Schedule to this Agreement in such a way as to make its relevance or
applicability to information called for by another Schedule or other
Schedules to this Agreement reasonably apparent shall be deemed to be
disclosed on such other Schedule or Schedules, as the case may
be, notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross-
reference thereto.  \t\t\t\t53    12.4 Further Assurances. \t
_______________________   Each of Buyer and Seller will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all conditions to its and the
other Party\'s obligations hereunder to be timely satisfied and to perform
and fulfill all obligations on its part to be performed and fulfilled under
this Agreement, to the end that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be effected substantially in accordance with its terms as
soon as reasonably practicable. Each of Buyer and Seller shall execute and
deliver both before and after the Closing such further
certificates, agreements and other documents and take such other actions as
the other Party may reasonably request to consummate or implement
the transactions contemplated hereby or to evidence such events or matters.
With respect to the securing of any requisite Approvals after Closing, the
Parties shall timely and promptly make all filings which may be required for
the securing of such Approvals. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, each of Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to file notification and report forms and similar applications with any
applicable Governmental Entity whose Approval may be required following the
Closing Date. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate and use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any requests for information by
any Governmental Entity in connection with such post-Closing Approvals.  
12.5 Governing Law. \t __________________   This Agreement and the legal
relations between the Parties shall be governed by and construed in

otherwise provided therein) when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each Party and delivered to the other Party.   12.8 Parties in Interest. \t

the benefit of each Party, and nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

of any third person to any Party to this Agreement.  \t\t\t\t54    12.9
Waiver. \t ___________   No failure on the part of any Party to exercise
or delay in exercising any right hereunder shall be deemed a waiver thereof,
nor shall any single or partial exercise preclude any further or other
exercise of such or any other right.   12.10 Severability. \t
______________________   If any provision of this Agreement is determined to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by any Governmental Entity,
the remaining provisions of this Agreement to the extent permitted by Law
shall remain in full force and effect PROVIDED that the essential terms and
conditions of this Agreement for both Parties remain valid, binding and
enforceable and PROVIDED that the economic and legal substance of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any Party. In event of any such determination, the
Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement to fulfill
as closely as possible the original intents and purposes hereof. To the
extent permitted by Law, the Parties hereby to the same extent waive any
provision of Law that renders any provision hereof prohibited or
unenforceable in any respect.   12.11 No Consequential or Punitive
Damages. \t ______________________________________________  
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no
Party (or its Affiliates) shall, in any event, be liable to the other Party

alleged breach or nonperformance or alleged nonperformance of this Agreement;

indirect, incidental or consequential damages are caused by and are a
reasonably foreseeable result of such breach or violation. The provisions of
this Section 12.11 are not intended to limit the rights of the Company under
any insurance policy set forth on SCHEDULE 3.1(u).   12.12 Knowledge

acknowledge that each Party has been represented by counsel in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly,
any rule of Law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of

of this Agreement is, in the judgment of the trier of fact, ambiguous or
unclear, that provision shall be interpreted in a reasonable manner to effect
the intent of the Parties.   12.19 Reference of Disputes to Senior Officers
of Seller and
Buyer. _______________________________________________________________  
Any dispute between Seller and Buyer arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement or any alleged breach hereof may, at the option of either
Seller or Buyer, be submitted for discussion and possible resolution by
senior officers of Seller and Buyer, as designated by their respective chief
executive officers, for a period of thirty days (or such longer period
as the Parties may in particular cases so decide) before initiating any
arbitration pursuant to Section 12.20 hereof.  \t\t\t\t57     12.20
Resolution of Disputes. \t ________________________________   (a) Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement and notwithstanding any termination of
this Agreement, all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the negotiation, validity or performance hereof
or the transactions contemplated hereby that are not resolved by mutual
agreement shall be resolved solely and exclusively by binding arbitration
before the American Arbitration Association or its successor (the "AAA"). The
arbitration shall be held in Fairfax County, Virginia before a single
arbitrator and shall be conducted in accordance with the rules and
regulations promulgated by the AAA unless specifically modified herein.
Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the AAA with
respect to any such matter and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it
may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such proceeding.   (b) Within fifteen days after demand for
arbitration has been made by either Party, the Parties, and/or their
counsel, shall meet to discuss the issues involved and to discuss a
suitable arbitrator. Upon the failure of the Parties to agree upon
an arbitrator within a reasonable time (not longer than thirty days from the
demand), the Parties shall request that the AAA send each Party an identical
list of names of persons from its panel of arbitrators from which to select
an arbitrator. Each Party shall have fifteen days from the date on which such
list is transmitted to the Parties to strike names objected to, number the
remaining names in order of preference, and return the list to the AAA. If a
Party does not return the list within the time specified, all persons named
therein shall be deemed acceptable. From among the persons who have been
approved on both lists, and in accordance with the designated order of mutual
preference, the AAA shall invite the acceptance of an arbitrator to serve.
If the Parties fail to agree on any of the persons named, or if acceptable
arbitrators are unable to act, or if for any other reason the appointment
cannot be made from the submitted lists, the AAA shall have the power to make
the appointment from among other members of the panel without the submission
of additional lists. The Parties covenant and agree that the arbitration
shall commence within one hundred twenty days of the date on which a written
demand for arbitration is filed by any Party. In connection with the
arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall have the power to order the
production of documents by each Party and any third party witnesses and shall
be empowered to decide any disputes regarding the scope of discovery. In
addition, each Party may take up to three depositions as of right, and
the arbitrator may in his or her discretion allow additional depositions
upon good cause shown by the moving party. However, the arbitrator shall not
have the power to order the answering of interrogatories or the response to
requests for admission. In connection with any arbitration, each Party shall
provide to the other, no later than ten days before the date of the
arbitration, the identity of all persons who may testify at the
arbitration and a copy of all documents that may be introduced at
the arbitration or considered or used by a Party\'s witness or expert. The
arbitrator\'s decision and award shall be made and delivered in writing to
each Party within sixty days of the conclusion of the arbitration hearing.
The arbitrator\'s decision shall set forth a reasoned basis for his or her
decision, including any award of damages or finding of liability. The
arbitrator shall not have the power to award damages that are
specifically excluded under this Agreement (even if permitted under
any potentially applicable Law), and each Party hereby irrevocably waives
any claim to such damages. The Parties covenant and agree that they will
participate in the arbitration in good faith. The prevailing Party in any
arbitration, proceeding or legal action arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys\' fees
and costs incurred in connection with such arbitration, proceeding or
legal action. The arbitrator shall determine who the prevailing party is for
this purpose.  \t\t\t\t58     (c) Each of the Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally consents (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the AAA to resolve all disputes, claims
or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the negotiation, validity or performance hereof or the
transactions contemplated hereby and further consents to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Virginia for the purposes
of compelling arbitration under this Section. Each Party further irrevocably
waives any objection to proceeding before the AAA based upon lack of personal
jurisdiction or to the laying of the venue and further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to make a claim in any court that
arbitration before the AAA has been brought in an inconvenient forum or that
the arbitration provisions of this Agreement are unenforceable. Each of the
Parties hereby consents to service of process by registered mail at the
address to which notices are to be given. Each of the Parties agrees that its
submission to jurisdiction and its consent to service of process by mail is
made for the express benefit of the other Party.  \t(d) This Section 12.20
shall apply to all forms of actions, including requests for temporary,
preliminary or permanent injunctive relief, except that to the extent
arbitration pursuant to this Section 12.20 would not be available in a timely
fashion so as to enable any party hereto to avoid immediate and irreparable
harm, such Party may proceed in court without prior arbitration for the
limited purpose of avoiding such immediate and irreparable harm. Each of the
Parties consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Virginia for
any proceeding in court permitted under the immediately preceding sentence.
The Parties agree that the arbitrator shall have full authority to grant
provisional remedies and to direct the Parties to request that any court
modify or vacate any temporary or preliminary relief issued by such court,
and to award damages for the failure of any Party to respect the
arbitrator\'s orders to that effect. Any award in any arbitration proceeding
may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction, and the
Party seeking enforcement shall be entitled to an award of all costs, fees
and expenses, including reasonable attorneys\' fees, to be paid by the Party
against whom enforcement is ordered.  \t(e) BY SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT, THE
PARTIES ARE, EXCEPT TO THE LIMITED EXTENT PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 12.20,
AGREEING TO HAVE ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS OR CONTROVERSIES ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT DECIDED BY ARBITRATION, AND ARE GIVING UP ANY
RIGHTS THEY MIGHT POSSESS TO HAVE THOSE MATTERS LITIGATED IN A COURT OR JURY
TRIAL. BY SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES ARE GIVING UP THEIR JUDICIAL
RIGHTS TO DISCOVERY AND APPEAL EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE
SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED FOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. IF ANY PARTY REFUSES TO
SUBMIT TO ARBITRATION AFTER AGREEING TO THIS PROVISION, IT MAY BE COMPELLED
TO ARBITRATE UNDER FEDERAL OR STATE LAW. EACH PARTY\'S AGREEMENT TO
THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION IS VOLUNTARY.   12.21 No Third Party
Beneficiaries.  \t ______________________________________   This Agreement
is not intended to, and shall not be construed to, confer upon any Person
other than the Parties any rights or remedies
