issued under the Option Plan that has vested or, in accordance with the terms

will vest in connection with the Transactions (each a " _Vested Option_ "
and collectively, the " _Vested Options_ ") shall terminate and be canceled

consideration therefor, a cash payment equal to the product of (a) the
excess, if any, of (i) the Company Common Stock Price Per Share over (ii) the
exercise price of such Vested Option multiplied by (b) the number of Shares of
Company Common Stock covered by such Vested Option (the " _Option

Consideration with respect to such Vested Options.

 

  3.2.2. All Options outstanding at the Effective Time,

Option that has an exercise price that is equal to or less than the Company

_Replacement Option_ ") to purchase Parent common shares (" _Parent Shares_
") that will be granted pursuant to the terms of the Parents equity
compensation plans. Each Replacement Option shall be exercisable for, and
represent the right to acquire, that whole number of Parent Shares (rounded
down to the nearest whole number of Parent Shares) equal to the number of
Shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Option multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which shall be equal to the Company Common Stock

fraction being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") and the

exercise price per share subject to such Option divided by the Exchange Ratio
(rounded upward to the nearest full cent). Except as provided in this and the
preceding sentence, the terms of any Replacement Option shall have
substantially the same terms as the corresponding cancelled Option, including
the existing vesting schedule

     

 and the provisions providing for the acceleration of vesting. No Replacement
Options shall be granted in respect of Options that have an exercise price
that exceeds the Company Common Stock Price Per Share.

Time, Parent shall deliver to each holder of a Replacement Option an
appropriate notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant thereto.
Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of Parent Shares for delivery upon exercise of Replacement
Options pursuant to the terms set forth in this Section 3.2. As soon as
practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) days, after the Effective
Time, the Parent Shares subject to options shall be covered by an effective
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or another
appropriate form.

 

  3.3. _Withholding_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Paying Agent and the Payroll Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold

Shares of Company Common Stock or Vested Options such amounts as may be
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Legal
Requirement, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be responsible for
making any required filings with and payments to Tax authorities relating to
any such deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so deducted
and withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares of Company Common
Stock or Vested Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made. In order to avoid the imposition of U.S. backup withholding tax, the
Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any Equityholder
that is not exempt from U.S. back-up withholding tax to provide Parent with
an IRS Form W-8 or W-9, as applicable, and it is understood that the failure
of any such Equityholder to provide such form prior to the payment of any
amounts to such Equityholder pursuant to this Section 3 may result in
the application of U.S. back-up withholding to such payments. The Company and
Parent shall cooperate to avoid the imposition of U.S. withholding tax under
Section 1445 of the Code, including, if practicable, through the Company\'s
delivery to Parent, on or prior to the Closing Date, of a certificate, in
accordance with the Treasury Regulations under such Section 1445, that the
Company is not a "United States real property holding corporation" within the
meaning of Section 897 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder.

respectively, or certificates of deposit issued by a commercial bank having at
least $25,000,000,000 in assets.

 

  3.5.2. _Payment Procedures for Shares_. Promptly after
the Effective Time and in any event within five Business Days thereof, to the
extent any applicable Stockholder was not previously paid pursuant to Section
3.5.6, the Surviving Corporation or Parent will cause the Paying Agent to mail
to each holder of record of one or more Certificates, (a) a letter
of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent, will contain provisions consistent with this
Section 3.5.2 and will be in such form and have such other provisions as the
Buyer Parties may reasonably specify), and (b) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the applicable
portion of the Payment Fund. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation
to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the Shares previously
represented by such Certificate were converted pursuant to Section 3.1, as set
forth on the Closing Payment Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered
will immediately thereafter be cancelled. If any holder of Shares is unable
to surrender such holders Certificates because such Certificates have been
lost, mutilated or destroyed, such holder shall deliver in lieu thereof an
affidavit in form and

     

 substance reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, post a bond in such amount as may be
directed by the Surviving Corporation as indemnity against any claim that may
be made in respect of such Certificate.

 

  3.5.3. _No Further Transfers of Shares or Exercises of
Options_. After the Effective Time there will be no further registration on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of (a) transfers of
Shares or (b) the exercise of Options that were outstanding immediately prior

  3.5.4. _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of
the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the Stockholders six months
after the Effective Time will be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon
demand, and any Stockholder who has not previously complied with this Section
3 will thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of its
claim for the Merger Consideration, without interest.

 

  3.5.5. _No Liability_. None of the Buyer Parties, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, nor any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents or counsel, will be liable
to any Person in respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Legal Requirement.

 

  3.5.6. _Payments at Closing_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Section 3.5, the Buyer Parties will cause
the (a) Paying Agent to pay, immediately following the Effective Time (or as
soon thereafter on the Closing Date as is practicable), to each Stockholder by
wire transfer of immediately available funds the portion of the Payment Fund
(less any applicable withholding Taxes) payable pursuant to Section 3.5.2 to
such Stockholder if such Stockholder has delivered to the Paying Agent
properly executed letters of transmittal (in the form required by this Section
3.5), wire transfer instructions and the Certificates evidencing such Shares
of such Stockholder, together with such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Buyer Parties or the Paying Agent and (b) Payroll Agent to

Closing Date as is practicable), to each Option Holder by wire transfer of
immediately available funds the portion of the Option Consideration (less any
applicable withholding Taxes) payable pursuant to Section 3.2.1 to such
Option Holder. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated
Closing Date, the Buyer Parties will deliver to the Company a sufficient
number of copies of an acceptable form of letter of transmittal and
such other documents required by the Paying Agent or the Buyer Parties so as
to permit each Stockholder to exercise its right to payment immediately after
the Effective Time as provided in this Section 3.5.6, and the Company will use
its reasonable best efforts to deliver such materials, or otherwise make such
materials available to, each Stockholder as promptly as reasonably
practicable.

  6.12. _Tender Offer_.

 

  6.12.1. After the date hereof and prior to the Closing
Date, Parent and Merger Sub may commence a tender offer and consent
solicitation (the " _Tender Offer_ ") pursuant to the Exchange Act for the
Senior Subordinated Notes. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to assist the Buyer Parties in connection with the preparation of all
filings, mailings or other submissions to be made in connection with the
Tender Offer. The terms, conditions and structure of the Tender Offer (which
shall also include the elimination of substantially all negative covenants in
the Senior Subordinated Notes) shall be determined by the Buyer Parties
following consultation with the Company; _provided_ , that the Tender Offer
shall not be conducted by or on behalf of any Target Company. The Tender
Offer shall not be consummated nor shall any amounts be payable to the holders
of the Senior Subordinated Notes in the event this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 10.1. Except as provided herein, all premiums and
interest accruals related to the Tender Offer, and all costs, fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Tender Offer or payments made in
connection therewith, including payments made to the investment banking firm
managing the Tender Offer, and legal and accounting fees and expenses
incurred in connection therewith, shall be paid by the Buyer Parties. In
addition, the Buyer Parties shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and representatives from and
against any and all losses or liabilities suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the Tender Offer, except to the extent that such losses or
liabilities are the result of gross negligence or willful misconduct by the
Target Companies or their representatives.

 

  6.12.2. If at any time prior to the Closing, the
Target Companies, Parent or the Buyer Parties discover information relating to
the Target Companies of a type that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the documents filed or mailed in respect of the Tender Offer so
that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and the Target Companies shall assist Parent and
Merger Sub in promptly preparing an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information to the extent required by applicable Legal

     

 Requirement, which amendment or supplement will be, if required, filed with
the SEC and/or disseminated to the holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes.

 

  6.13. _Drag-Along Rights_. Welsh, Carson, Anderson and Stowe IX,
L.P. (" _WCAS_ ") will, within five Business Days after the date of this
Agreement, deliver the Drag-Along Notice (as defined in each of the 2006
Stockholders Agreement, the 2004 Shareholders Agreement and the Bylaws of the
Company) to exercise its rights (the " _Drag-Along Rights_ ") under Article IV
of the 2006 Stockholders Agreement to the Drag-Along Stockholders (as defined
in the 2006 Stockholders Agreement), under Article 3 of the 2004 Shareholders
Agreement to the Shareholders (as defined in the 2004 Shareholders Agreement)
and Section 10 of the Bylaws of the Company to the Restricted Stockholders (as
defined in the Bylaws of the Company), which Drag-Along Notice will comply
with the requirements of Section 4.02 of the Stockholders Agreement, Section
3.1(b) of the 2004 Shareholders Agreement and Section 10(b) of the Bylaws of
the Company. To the extent that any Stockholder has demanded appraisal rights
in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, prior to the Closing Date the
Company, Parent and WCAS shall enter into an agreement which provides that
Parent and its Affiliates are indemnified and held harmless by WCAS from any
and all losses and liabilities suffered or incurred by Parent or its
Affiliates (including the Target Companies) in connection with resolving such
demands (which losses and liabilities shall exclude any amounts paid to
the Payment Fund with respect to such Shares).

 

  6.14. _Interim Financials_. The Company shall deliver to Parent
by no later than 45 days after the date of this Agreement copies of the
Balance Sheet and the related unaudited consolidated statements of income,
cash flow and stockholders equity of AmeriPath and its Subsidiaries for the
three-month period then ended. Such unaudited financial statements will be
prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis throughout the
period indicated (except as may be indicated in such statements or the notes
thereto), and will present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position and results of operations of AmeriPath and
its Subsidiaries for the period specified therein, subject to an absence of
notes.

by delivering written notice to the Company at any time prior to Closing, in
the event the Company is in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement, if the Buyer Parties have notified

inability of the Buyer Parties to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section

days after delivery of such notice of breach.

 

  10.1.4. The Buyer Parties or the Company may terminate

Parties, or Section 8, in the case of the Company, to be satisfied (other than
through the failure of any party seeking to terminate this Agreement or any
of its Affiliates to comply with its obligations under this Agreement);

will arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement. The inclusion of any information in
the Schedules will not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of
itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in the
Schedules, that such information is required to be listed in the Schedules or
that such items are material to the Target Companies. The headings, if any, of
the individual sections of each of the Schedules are inserted for convenience
only and will not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of the
Agreement. The Schedules are arranged in sections corresponding to those
contained in this Agreement merely for convenience, and the disclosure of an
item in one section of the Schedules as an exception to any particular
covenant, representation or warranty will be deemed adequately disclosed as an
exception with respect to all other covenants, representations or warranties
to the extent that the relevance of such item to such other covenants,
representations or warranties is readily apparent on its face, notwithstanding
the presence or absence of an appropriate section of the Schedules with
respect to such other covenants, representations or warranties or an
appropriate cross-reference thereto.

     

  11.13. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts (and may be executed by telecopier signatures), each

arising under or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, shall be
governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the domestic
substantive laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice
or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of the
laws of any other jurisdiction.

     

  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto, intending to be legally
bound hereby, have caused this Agreement and Plan of Merger to be duly
executed and delivered, as of the date first above written.
