ARTICLE 2 
 _PURCHASE AND SALE_

 

2A. _Purchase and Sale of the Interests_.

 

(i) In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Closing, Buyer shall purchase and acquire from Seller,
and Seller shall sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver to Buyer, all of
the Interests, in each case free and clear of any Liens, other than Permitted
Encumbrances (the " _Purchase_ "), in consideration of the payment by Buyer of
(x) $166,000,000 (the " _Base Purchase Price_ "), as adjusted in accordance
with _Section 2C_  (as adjusted, the " _Purchase Price_ ") and (y) subject
to the provisions of _Section 2A(iii)_ , the Contingent Payment, in each
case, payable in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. As
promptly as commercially reasonably practicable, and in any event within two
(2) Business Days, following Buyers receipt of the initial Letter of Credit
in accordance with _Section 6V(i)_ , Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount
equal to $10,000,000 (the " _Initial Payment_ ") as an initial payment toward
the payment of the Base Purchase Price, to be retained by Seller except as
otherwise set forth in this Agreement. If Buyer fails to pay such Initial
Payment within such two (2) Business Day period, such failure shall
constitute a material breach by Buyer under this Agreement and the Initial
Payment, until paid to Seller, shall accrue interest thereon at the Prime
Rate.

   

(ii) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, the amount payable at
the Closing for the Interests (the " _Closing Payment_ ") shall be an
amount equal to: (a) the Base Purchase Price, _minus_ (b) the
Initial Payment, _plus_ (c) the amount (if any) by which the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital exceeds the Targeted Net Working
Capital,  _minus_ (d) the amount (if any) by which the Targeted Net Working
Capital exceeds the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital,  _minus_ (e) the
amount (if any) of the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, _minus_ (f) the
Remediation Cost Advances (if any).

 

(iii) After the Closing Date, as of the first day that the Southern Mainline
is placed in service as a FERC-regulated natural gas pipeline (the " _In-
Service Date_ "), if Buyer has secured binding natural gas capacity
commitments for the Southern Mainline for an average term of ten (10) years,
for the full capacity of Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand (250,000) dekatherm
per day (" _Dth/day_ ") of the Southern Mainline (" _Full Southern Mainline
Capacity_ ") then, if applicable, an additional payment (the " _Contingent
Payment_ ") shall be paid by Buyer to Seller as determined by the average
daily demand rate at which the Full Southern Mainline Capacity is contracted,
calculated in the manner set forth on _Schedule 2A(iii)_. The Contingent
Payment, if any, shall be paid on or before the forty-fifth (45th) day after
the In-Service Date. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Precedent Agreements entered into simultaneously with the
execution of this Agreement and Service Agreements for firm transportation
service under the Rate Schedule FTS to be entered into under the Precedent
Agreements will not be included in the calculation of the average daily
demand rate or any other calculations relating to the Contingent Payment.

 

2B. _Delivery of Estimated Closing Statement_. At least five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller will prepare and deliver to Buyer a
written statement setting forth in reasonable detail Sellers good
faith estimate of: (i) the Closing Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital_ "), (ii) the Closing Date Indebtedness (the "
_Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ "), (iii) the Remediation Cost Advances, if
any (the " _Estimated Remediation Cost Advances_ "), and (iv) the
Closing Payment resulting therefrom. Buyer shall have the right, acting in
good faith, to review and comment upon the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital, the Estimated Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Payment resulting
therefrom, as set forth in the statement delivered by Seller, and shall
provide any such comments to Seller no later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date. Seller will review and consider Buyers comments
to such closing statement and, acting in good faith, shall incorporate such
comments into such closing statement in its reasonable judgment, in which
case the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness and Estimated Remediation Cost Advances, if any, used to
calculate the Closing Payment pursuant to  _Section 2A(ii)_ shall be the
respective amounts set forth in such adjusted closing statement delivered to
Buyer at least one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date.

 

2C. _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(i) Within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare
and deliver to Seller a written statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth Buyers calculation (together with reasonable supporting
detail of each such calculation) of the Closing Net Working Capital, the
Closing Indebtedness, the Remediation Cost Advances, if any, and
the resulting Final Purchase Price, together with a certificate of Buyer
certifying that it has complied with the covenants set forth in _Section
2C(vii)_. The Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and
the applicable definitions in this Agreement. During the thirty (30) days
immediately following Sellers receipt of the Closing Statement and any
period of dispute thereafter with respect to such Closing Statement, Buyer
shall, and shall cause the Company to, (a) provide Seller and its
Representatives with reasonable access to the books, records (including
work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents), supporting data and,
upon prior written notice, the facilities and employees of the Company
reasonably necessary for Seller to complete its review of the Closing
Statement, and (b) reasonably cooperate with Seller and its Representatives
in connection with such review. The Closing Statement (including the Closing
Net Working Capital, the Closing Indebtedness, the Remediation Cost Advances,
if any, and Final Purchase Price set forth thereon) shall become final and
binding upon the Parties thirty (30) days following Sellers receipt thereof
unless Seller gives written notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice
of Disagreement_ ") to Buyer prior to such date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Closing Statement shall alternatively become final and binding upon
the Parties upon Sellers delivery, prior to the expiration of such
thirty (30)-day period, of written notice to Buyer of its acceptance of the
Closing Statement delivered by Buyer. Any Notice of Disagreement shall
specify in reasonable detail the nature and amount of any disagreement so
asserted, including the item(s) in dispute and Sellers calculation
thereof. 

   

(ii) If a timely Notice of Disagreement is delivered by Seller, then the
Closing Statement (as revised in accordance with this _Section 2C(ii)_ ),
and the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Indebtedness, the
Remediation Cost Advances, if any, and the Final Purchase Price set forth
thereon shall become final and binding upon the Parties on the earlier of (a)
the date all matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement are finally
resolved in writing by Seller and Buyer and (b) the date all matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement not resolved in writing by Seller and
Buyer are finally resolved in writing by an independent, nationally
recognized accounting, consulting or valuation firm (other than a so-called
"Big Four" accounting firm) mutually selected by Seller and Buyer (such firm,
the " _Arbiter_ ," or absent such agreement then upon written notice to the
other Party, each Party shall each have three (3) Business Days to select a
nationally recognized accounting, consulting or valuation firm (other than a
so-called "Big-Four" accounting firm) and such selected firms shall together
select the Arbiter, and if any Party does not select a such a firm, then the
firm selected by the other Party shall be the Arbiter) in accordance with
this _Section 2C(ii)_. During the thirty (30) days immediately following the
delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, or such longer period as Seller and
Buyer may agree in writing, Seller and Buyer shall seek in good faith to
resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to any
matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement, and all such discussions
related thereto shall (unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller) be
governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement) and any applicable similar state rule. At the end of
such thirty (30)-day period or such agreed-upon longer period, Seller
and Buyer shall promptly retain the Arbiter and execute a customary
engagement letter with respect to such engagement. Within ten (10) Business
Days of such engagement (the " _Submission Deadline_ "), the Parties
shall submit to the Arbiter for review and resolution all matters (but only
such matters) that remain in dispute and that were properly included in the
Notice of Disagreement (the " _Disputed Items_ ") as follows: Buyer
shall deliver the Closing Statement and Seller shall deliver the relevant
Notice of Disagreement, and each Party will submit a supporting brief and any
supporting materials, in each case, to the Arbiter. Subject to the
immediately following sentence, each Party may make an oral presentation to
the Arbiter (in which case the applicable Party will provide prompt prior
notice of such presentation to the other Party, who will be entitled to
attend or have a representative attend such presentation (the supporting
brief and any materials submitted being referred to as a Partys "
_Submission_ ")). Each Party shall, on or prior to the Submission Deadline,
notify the Arbiter and the other Party as to whether or not it will make an
oral presentation and, should any Party so elect, shall make such oral
presentation on or before the date that is ten (10) Business Days after the
Submission Deadline. The Parties shall instruct the Arbiter to, and the
Arbiter shall, deliver its final, written determination of the Disputed Items
in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement
(which final determination shall be delivered as promptly as possible, but no
later than the 20th day after the later of (x) the Submission Deadline and
(y) if either or both Parties elect to make an oral presentation, the date of
the last such presentation), and such determination by the Arbiter shall be
final and binding and shall not be subject to court review or otherwise
appealable. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with the Arbiter during the term
of its engagement. Seller and Buyer shall instruct the Arbiter to determine,
with respect to each Disputed Item, whether Buyers Submission or Sellers
Submission with respect to such Disputed Item reflects the more accurate
calculation of such Disputed Item (for example, if the amount of accounts
receivable is a Disputed Item, the Arbiter may select only the amount of
accounts receivable proposed by Buyer in the Closing Statement, as supported
by its Submission, or Seller in the Notice of Disagreement, as supported by
its Submission, as the final amount of accounts receivable incorporated into
the final Closing Net Working Capital). Seller and Buyer shall also instruct
the Arbiter to, and the Arbiter shall, make its determination based solely on
the Closing Statement, the Notice of Disagreement and the Submissions
submitted by Seller and Buyer to the Arbiter that are in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on the
basis of an independent review). The Closing Statement shall be revised to
the extent necessary to reflect any mutual resolution in writing by Seller
and Buyer and/or any final resolution made by the Arbiter in accordance with
this _Section 2C(ii)_ (the " _Final Closing Statement_ "), and the
Final Closing Statement shall be final, binding and conclusive on all
Parties. The costs, fees and expenses of the Arbiter shall be paid by Buyer,
on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, determined on the basis of
the degree to which the Arbiters determination of the Final Purchase Price,
as contained in the Final Closing Statement, as modified by this _Section
2C(ii)_ , accepts the respective positions of Buyer and Seller with respect
to the Disputed Items. The " _Adjustment Finalization Date_ " shall refer to
the date the Closing Statement becomes final and binding on the Parties
pursuant to this  _Section 2C_.

   

(iii) If (a) the sum of (1) the Closing Payment _plus_ (2) the
Initial Payment _is less than_ (b) the Final Purchase Price (such shortfall,
the " _Adjustment Amount_ "), then, subject to the other terms and conditions
of this Agreement, within five (5) Business Days after the Adjustment
Finalization Date, Buyer shall pay by wire transfer in immediately available
funds to Seller the Adjustment Amount, together with interest thereon
pursuant to _Section 2C(v)_.

 

(iv) If (a) the sum of (1) the Closing Payment _plus_ (2) the
Initial Payment _is greater than_ (b) the Final Purchase Price (such
shortfall, the " _Excess Amount_ "), then, subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Agreement, within five (5) Business Days after the
Adjustment Finalization Date, Seller shall pay by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to Buyer the Excess Amount, together with
interest thereon pursuant to _Section 2C(v)_.

 

(v) Any payment pursuant to  _Section 2C(iii)_ or _Section 2C(iv)_ shall
be made together with interest thereon at Prime Rate, calculated on the basis

(2) transfer the employment of any individual who is not a Business Employee
to the Company;

 

 (k) except in the ordinary course of business, (1) terminate the employment
of any Business Employee (other than for cause), (2) hire any individual as a

any Material Contract to expire in accordance with its terms, (3) the
execution of purchase orders and/or work orders pursuant to Material Contracts

 (p) cancel, compromise, waive, release or settle any Claim that is brought

Company;

 

 (q) from and after the required delivery date of the initial Letter of
Credit pursuant to _Section 6V(i),_ fail to maintain the Letter of Credit (or

 (s) agree or commit in a writing to do any of the foregoing.

 

 (ii) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, subject to Buyers consent right in
this _Section 6B_ : (a) nothing in this Agreement shall give Buyer, directly

any time prior to the Closing and (b) prior to the Closing, the Company shall

reasonable efforts" of Seller shall not require Seller or any of its

during the Interim Period that could affect any such conversion.

    

 6C. _Support Obligations_.

 

 (i) Buyer recognizes that the Credit Support Obligors have provided the
Support Obligations to or on behalf of the Company.

 

 (ii) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to replace the Support
Obligations with credit support provided by Buyer and its Affiliates in types
and amounts no less favorable to Buyer and its Affiliates than the types and
amounts set forth on _Schedule 4R_ of the Company Disclosure Letter and to
effect the full and unconditional release of the relevant Credit Support
Obligors from the relevant Support Obligations and all obligations and
liabilities in respect thereof, which replacement credit support may include:

 

 (a) furnishing a letter of credit to replace each existing letter of credit
that is a Support Obligation;

 

 (b) providing a guaranty from Buyer Guarantor to replace each existing
guaranty that is a Support Obligation; or

 

 (c) instituting an escrow arrangement or posting a surety or performance
bond, or otherwise novating, assigning or replacing any other Support
Obligation, in the case of each of _subparagraphs (a)_ , _(b)_ and _(c)_ ,
subject to the terms and provisions of this _Section 6C_.

 

 Seller shall not be obligated to incur, pay, reimburse or provide or cause
any of its Affiliates to incur, pay, reimburse or provide, any liability,
compensation, consideration or charge in order to obtain or effect any release
of Support Obligations contemplated by this _Section 6C_.

 

 (iii) In connection with the release of Support Obligations contemplated by
this _Section 6C_ , Buyer and Seller shall cooperate, and each shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts, to cause the beneficiary or beneficiaries of
such Support Obligations to (a) remit any cash and cash equivalents (including
any interest payable thereon) to the Credit Support Obligor or its designee
held under any escrow or cash collateral arrangement that is a Support
Obligation promptly following the replacement of such escrow or cash
collateral arrangement pursuant to _Section 6C(ii)_ and (b) terminate,
surrender and redeliver to the Credit Support Obligor or its designees each
original copy of each such Support Obligation.

 

 (iv) With respect to each Support Obligation that has not been replaced
pursuant to _Section 6C(ii)_ by the Closing Date, then:

 

 (a) Buyer shall indemnify Seller and the applicable Credit Support Obligor
for any Losses incurred by such Person in connection with each Support
Obligation to the extent, and only to the extent, relating exclusively to the
Company and attributable to the period commencing at or after the Closing
(including reimbursement as promptly as reasonably practicable following
demand therefor (which demand will include reasonable supporting
documentation) with respect to any demand or draw upon, or withdrawal from,
any Support Obligation);

 

 (b) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates, including the Company,
not to, after the Closing, effect any amendments or modifications or any other
changes to, assign, authorize or transfer to a third party, any Contracts or
obligations to which any of the Support Obligations relate, or otherwise take
any action that would increase, extend or accelerate the liability of any
Credit Support Obligor under any Support Obligation, without Sellers prior
written consent;

   

 (c) to the extent and only to the extent that any Credit Support Obligor has
any performance obligations under any Support Obligations attributable to the
period commencing at or after the Closing Date, Buyer shall (I) at any Credit
Support Obligors written request and without creating any agency relationship
or agency liability in respect thereof, perform such obligations of such
Credit Support Obligor to the maximum extent practicable, and (II) otherwise
take such actions as may be requested from time to time by the applicable
Credit Support Obligor so as to put such Credit Support Obligor in the same
position as if Buyer had performed or was performing such obligations; and

 

 (d) Buyer shall deliver to Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates at
the Closing, and will maintain at all times after the Closing until the
release of each Support Obligation in accordance with this _Section 6C_ , a
letter of credit or guaranty or other credit support in a form reasonably
acceptable to Seller from a third party reasonably acceptable to Seller in an
amount equal to the maximum amount of all outstanding Support Obligations, it
being understood that (I) the Buyer Guaranty shall satisfy the foregoing
obligation and (II) Seller may reject any such credit support from any Person
(other than Buyer Guarantor) that maintains, or has maintained in the prior
six (6) months, less than an Investment Grade credit rating.

 

 6D. _Confidentiality; Publicity; Restrictive Covenants_.

 

 (i) No Party will make any public announcement or issue any public
communication regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, or any matter related to the foregoing, without the prior written
consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
_Section 6D(i)_ shall prohibit any Party from issuing or making any public
announcement or statement if such Party deems it necessary to do so in order
to comply with applicable Law, including state or federal securities laws, or
the rules of any stock exchange upon which such Partys or any of its
Affiliates stock is listed or traded or for purposes of compliance with
financial reporting or other regulatory obligations; _provided_ _further_ that
to the extent possible, written notification shall be given to the other Party
prior to any such announcement or statement.

 

 (ii) From and after the Closing, the Parties agree to keep the terms of this
Agreement confidential, except to the extent that disclosure is required in
connection with the enforcement of this Agreement or any Ancillary Document or
to the extent that disclosure is required by applicable Law or the rules of
any stock exchange upon which such Partys or any of its Affiliates stock is
listed or traded or for purposes of compliance with financial reporting or
other regulatory obligations; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties may
disclose such terms to the Parties respective (A) lenders or debt investors
or (B) Representatives as necessary in connection with the ordinary conduct of
their respective businesses (so long as such Persons agree to be bound by
customary confidentiality obligations).

 

 (iii) Buyer acknowledges that, prior to the Closing, all information
provided to Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives by
Seller or its Affiliates or Representatives (including pursuant to _Section
6A_ ) is subject to the terms of (a) a confidentiality agreement between
Seller Guarantor and NJR Pipeline Company, dated as of March 9, 2016, and (b)
a confidentiality agreement between Talen Energy Marketing, LLC and NJR
Pipeline Company, dated as of January 9, 2017 (together, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Closing
should occur, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be terminated for all
purposes with respect to Buyer and the Company Restricted Information.

     

 (iv) From and after the Closing Date, (a) Seller shall (and shall cause its
Affiliates and each of their Representatives to) keep confidential and not
disclose any information regarding the Company (other than information
regarding the Excluded Assets) (the " _Company Restricted Information_ ") and
(b) Buyer shall (and shall cause its Affiliates each of their Representatives
to) keep confidential and not disclose any information regarding the Excluded
Assets (the " _Excluded Assets Restricted Information_ " and together with the
Company Restricted Information, collectively, the " _Restricted Information_
"), except as and to the extent permitted by the terms of this Agreement or
the Ancillary Documents. For purposes of this _Section 6D(iv)_ , the "
_Restricted Party_ " shall refer to "Seller" with respect to the Company
Restricted Information and "Buyer" with respect to the Excluded Assets
Restricted Information. This obligation shall not apply to any information
that (a) is available to the public, (b) is published or otherwise becomes
available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the
Restricted Party or its Representatives in violation of this _Section 6D(iv)_
or (c) becomes available to the Restricted Party or any of its Affiliates from
a Person who is not, to the Restricted Partys knowledge, prohibited from
disclosing such information to the Restricted Party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Restricted Party may make disclosures as required by applicable
Law or upon the request of any Governmental Entity; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Restricted Party shall, if and to the extent legally permitted to do
so, provide the other Party (the " _Disclosing Party_ ") with prompt notice
thereof so that the Disclosing Party, at its sole cost and expense, may seek a
protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the
provisions of this _Section 6D(iv)_. In the event that such protective order
or other remedy is not obtained or the Disclosing Party waives compliance with
the provisions of this _Section 6D(iv)_ , the Restricted Party shall, or shall
cause the Person required to disclose such Restricted Information to, furnish
only that portion of the information that the Restricted Party or such Person
is legally required to disclose. Further, except as permitted by this _Section
6D(iv)_ , Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly through their respective Representatives, for a period of two (2)
years after the Closing, (a) entice, induce or attempt to induce (I) any Hired
Employee or (II) any other employee of the Company, Buyer or any of Buyers
Affiliates with whom Seller or its directors, officers or employees have had
any material contact with in connection with the negotiations of this
Agreement, in each case, to terminate his or her employment with the Company,
Buyer or any of Buyers Affiliates, or (b) hire or employ any such employee;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the following solicitation or hiring of any such
employee shall not be deemed to violate the provisions of this _Section
6D(iv)_ : (I) through the use of general advertisements or (II) by any means
with respect to any such employee who, at the time of any such solicitation,
is no longer employed by the Company, Buyer or any of Buyers Affiliates. The
covenants and undertakings contained in this _Section 6D(iv)_ relate to
matters that are of a special, unique and extraordinary character, and a
violation of any of the terms of this _Section 6D(iv)_ will cause irreparable
injury to Buyer, the amount of which will be impossible to estimate or
determine and that cannot be adequately compensated. Accordingly, the remedy
at law for any breach of this _Section 6D(iv)_ will be inadequate. Therefore,
Buyer will be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or other equitable
relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of any breach of
this _Section 6D(iv)_ without the necessity of proving actual damages or
posting any bond whatsoever. The rights and remedies provided by this _Section
6D(iv)_ are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies which
Buyer may have hereunder or at law or in equity.

confirming that the Company will no longer be subject to the jurisdiction of
the PPUC upon the Closing (the HSR Approval and the approvals and

Company may not (without the prior written consent of Buyer), (x) to commence
any litigation against any Person in order to facilitate the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents or
(y) enter into any agreements or commitments or take any other actions to
obtain the Required Governmental Authorizations or to resolve any objections
in connection therewith if such agreement, commitment or other action would
require or compel the Company, Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer to dispose of
or hold separate all or any portion of its properties or assets or limit its
future activities or place of doing business.

 

(iii) With respect to the Governmental Authorizations, each of Buyer and
Seller shall, subject to any restrictions under applicable Law: (a) promptly
notify the other Party of and, if in writing, furnish such Party with copies
of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise of the contents of) any

independently participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity without

reasonably practicable, the opportunity to attend or participate.

   

(iv) If any litigation or other administrative or judicial action or
proceeding is commenced, threatened or foreseeable challenging the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than in connection with
obtaining HSR Approval) and such litigation, action or proceeding seeks, or
would reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent, materially impede or
materially delay the consummation of the Purchase, Buyer agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such litigation, action or
proceeding and each of Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with the other and
use commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such
litigation, action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed
or overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is
in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
Purchase. 

 

(v) Buyer acknowledges that certain third party consents to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties to Contracts to
which the Company is a party (including the Material Contracts). Seller shall
use commercially reasonably efforts to obtain any such consents.

 

(vi) Each of the Parties will cooperate and use all commercially reasonable

doing business name of any of its Affiliates or otherwise in the conduct of
its or any of its Affiliates businesses or operations.

 

(ii) In the event that Buyer breaches this _Section 6G_ , Seller shall be
entitled to specific performance of this _Section 6G_ and to injunctive
relief against further violations, as well as any other remedies at law or in
equity available to Seller.

 

6H. _Termination of Certain Affiliate Arrangements_. Except with respect to
the Affiliate Arrangements set forth on _Schedule 6H_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the
Non-Company Affiliates to, take such actions as may be necessary to
terminate, sever or assign to Seller or a Non-Company Affiliate (in each case
with appropriate mutual releases) effective upon or before the Closing all
Affiliate Arrangements (collectively, the " _Terminated Affiliate_
_Arrangements_ "), in each case without imposing any payment obligation or
liability on the Company. Except with respect to the Affiliate Arrangements
set forth on _Schedule 6H_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, prior to the
Closing, (a) any amounts due and owing by the Company to any Affiliate

the Company. Buyer acknowledges that all such Cash of the Company is the
exclusive property of the Company and Seller.

 

6J. _Employee, Labor and Benefits Matters_.

 

(i) _Benefit Plans_. From and after the Closing, no Hired Employee shall have
any right to accrue any further benefits, nor any right to continue as an
active participant under the Employee Benefit Plans.

 

(ii) _Termination of Employment by Seller and Hiring by Buyer_. Effective as
of the close of business on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall cause the Company to terminate the employment of all Business
Employees and all other employees of the Company, if any. At least fourteen
(14) days prior to the then reasonably anticipated Closing Date, Buyer or an
Affiliate thereof (" _Buyer Employer_ ") shall make written offers of
employment, effective as of the Closing Date and contingent upon the
consummation of Closing, to each Business Employee who is then actively
employed and listed on  _Schedule 6J(ii)_ , subject to such individual being
actively employed immediately prior to the termination of employment
described in the first sentence of _Schedule 6J(ii)_ and satisfying
Buyer Employers normal and legally permissible screening requirements for
employment, including applicable background checks, drug screens, work
authorization verification and similar requirements and other legally
permissible requirements to execute and deliver non-competition, non-
solicitation, confidentiality and other similar agreements applicable to
similarly situated employees of Buyer Employer. Each Business Employee who
accepts Buyer Employers offer of employment and commences employment with
Buyer Employer within fourteen (14) days after the Closing Date shall be
referred to herein as a " _Hired Employee_." Nothing in this Agreement will be
deemed to create or constitute an agreement of employment with Buyer Employer
for any specific period of time. As such, any Hired Employee and/or any other
individual offered employment with Buyer Employer (and who accepts such
offered employment) pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement will be
an at-will employee. Seller shall pay to each Business Employee (i) on or
prior to the Closing Date, (A) any short-term incentive bonus compensation
accrued by such Business Employee at target under Sellers or the Companys
or one of their Affiliates short-term incentive bonus compensation plans
through the date immediately prior to the Closing Date and (B) the amount of
compensation due in respect of the unused vacation time accrued by such
Business Employee as of the Closing; and (ii) on or before the date required
to be paid to Business Employees under the Employee Benefit Plans, Sellers
or any of its Affiliates policies or applicable Laws, all amounts that are
accrued as of the Closing for the Business Employees under the Employee
Benefit Plans and under applicable Laws. 

 

(iii) _WARN Act_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer with a
true and complete list of any Business Employee who experienced an
"employment loss" (as that term is defined in the WARN Act) occurring in the
ninety (90)-day period preceding the Closing Date, which list shall include
for each such Business Employee the date of the employment loss and such
Business Employees work location.

 

(iv) Seller shall comply with and be solely responsible for all liabilities
under the WARN Act and any comparable state or local Law with respect to any
employment losses occurring prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall comply
with and be solely responsible for all liabilities under the WARN Act
and similar state and local Laws arising from its actions with respect to
Hired Employees on or after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Buyer shall have no liability, and Seller shall have full liability, for
obligations under the WARN Act triggered by Buyer during the 90-day period
following the Closing as a result of inaccurate or incomplete information
provided by Seller in accordance with the first sentence of this  _Section
6J(iv)_.

   

(v) Buyer hereby agrees that effective as of the Closing Date and continuing
(i) for at least one (1) year following the Closing Date, or the employment
termination date of a Hired Employee if earlier, Buyer Employer will provide
(or cause to be provided) to each Hired Employee base salary or wages no less
favorable than the base salary or wages provided to such employee immediately
prior to the Closing, (ii) until the end of the calendar year in which the
Closing Date occurs, or the employment termination date of a Hired Employee
if earlier, Buyer Employer will provide (or cause to be provided) to each
Hired Employee bonus opportunities (other than equity compensation) that are,
in the aggregate with respect to such employee, substantially comparable to
the employee benefits provided to other similarly situated employees of Buyer
Employer, and (iii) for at least one (1) year following the Closing Date, or
the employment termination date a Hired Employee if earlier, Buyer Employer
will provide (or cause to be provided) employee benefits (other than equity
compensation) to each Hired Employee that are, in the aggregate with respect
to each employee, substantially comparable to the employee benefits provided
to other similarly situated employees of Buyer Employer. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall any Hired Employee be eligible to participate in any
employee benefit plan maintained by Buyer Employer or its Affiliates under
which other employees of Buyer Employer are not currently accruing benefits.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer Employer shall provide (or cause to be
provided) to each Hired Employee whose employment is terminated or receives
notice of termination following the Closing Date and on or prior to the end
of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs (in either case, other
than for "cause" as reasonably determined by Buyer Employer), severance
benefits no less favorable to the Hired Employee than those set forth on
_Schedule 6J(v)_ and Seller hereby agrees to reimburse Buyer Employer for
fifty percent (50%) of any such severance benefits paid by Buyer Employer
within ten (10) Business Days after receipt by Seller of written notice from
Buyer Employer that any such payments have been made (together
with reasonable documentation of such payments).

 

(vi) Buyer hereby agrees that Buyer Employer shall grant all Hired Employees
credit for any service with respect to Seller or any of its Affiliates
(including the Company, and for purposes of this _Section 6J(vi)_ , (x) PPL
Corporation and any of its Affiliates prior to June 1, 2015 and (y) only to
the extent such service has been recognized by Seller or its Affiliates prior
to the Closing, Gulf Interstate Energy, Inc. and its Affiliates prior to such
Hired Employees being hired by PPL Corporation and its Affiliates) earned
prior to the Closing Date for eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual
purposes under a tax-qualified "401(k)" plan sponsored, established or
maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ ") and any
other benefit plan, program or arrangement that is established, continued or
maintained by or on behalf of Buyer Employer on or after the Closing Date
(the Buyer 401(k) Plan and any other benefit plan, program or arrangement,
collectively, the " _New Plans_ "), in each case to the same extent such
service was recognized under a similar Employee Benefit Plan, and except, in
each case, to the extent such treatment would result in duplicative benefits.
In addition, Buyer hereby agrees that Buyer Employer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to waive all pre-existing condition exclusion and
actively-at-work requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting
periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any New Plans to the
same extent such conditions were not applicable under any Employee Benefit
Plan. Provided that Seller provides Buyer with all information reasonably
requested by Buyer and its service providers to allow Buyer Employer to
satisfy its obligations under this sentence, Buyer shall (and shall cause to)
assume the obligation to provide health continuation coverage required by
Section 4980B of the Code under a New Plan with respect to any Hired Employee
and his or her "qualified beneficiaries" (as defined in Section 4980B(g)(1)
of the Code) who experience a "qualifying event" (as defined in Section
4980B(f)(3) of the Code) under a New Plan on or after the Closing Date.
Seller and Buyer agree to cause their respective healthcare insurers and
third-party administrators to cooperate and share information, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, reasonably necessary to allow plans
maintained by Buyer to provide medical health continuation coverage to Hired
Employees promptly following the Closing and without a gap in coverage,
including for purposes of disease management. To the extent such sharing of
information requires the covered individuals consent under applicable Law,
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent.

   

(vii) Effective on the Closing Date or as soon as practical thereafter, Buyer
shall cause Buyer Employer to provide, or cause to be provided, to the Hired
Employees the right to participate in the Buyer 401(k) Plan. Each Hired
Employee who, prior to the Closing, participated in a 401(k) plan sponsored
or maintained by Seller or its Affiliates (the " _Seller 401(k) Plan_ ")
shall be given the opportunity as soon as administratively practicable after
the Closing Date to receive a distribution of his or her account balance
under the Seller 401(k) Plan (in cash, but also including any promissory
notes for associated participant loans) and to elect to roll over such
account (including promissory notes) into the Buyer 401(k) Plan.

 

(viii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing in
accordance with this Agreement, until the date that is two (2) years from and
after the date of such termination of this Agreement, (a) Buyer shall not
employ, and shall cause its Affiliates not to employ, any Business Employee
without Sellers prior written consent and (b) Buyer shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, in any manner
whatsoever, solicit for hire or employment any Business Employee or employee
or officer of Seller or any of its Affiliates to whom Buyer or its
Representatives had been directly or indirectly introduced or otherwise had
first contact with as a result of its consideration of the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that this paragraph shall not
apply to any solicitation (or any hiring as a result of any solicitation) (x)
that consists of a general advertisement or solicitation by Buyer through the
use of media advertisements, the Internet, or professional search firms that
is not targeted at any Business Employee or employee of Seller or its
Affiliates or (y) of any person who is no longer a Business Employee or
employed by Seller or its Affiliates so long as such employees resignation
or termination was not solicited, directly or indirectly, by Buyer or its
Affiliates in violation of this _Section 6J(viii)_.

 

(ix) Buyer Employer shall grant to all Hired Employees credit for any service
earned with Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Company, and for
purposes of this _Section 6J(ix)_ , (x) PPL Corporation and any of its
Affiliates prior to June 1, 2015 and (y) only to the extent such service has
been recognized by Seller or its Affiliates prior to the Closing, Gulf
Interstate Energy, Inc. and its Affiliates prior to such Hired Employees
being hired by PPL Corporation and its Affiliates) prior to the Closing under
any vacation plan maintained by Buyer Employer or its Affiliates; _provided_
, _however_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any Hired
Employee be entitled to more than six (6) weeks of paid-time off with Buyer
Employer or its Affiliates.

 

(x) Nothing herein, expressed or implied, shall confer upon any Business
Employees (or any of their beneficiaries or alternate payees) any rights or
remedies (including any right to employment or continued employment, or any
right to compensation or benefits for any period) of any nature or kind
whatsoever, under or by reason of this Agreement or otherwise. In addition,
the provisions of this _Section 6J_ are for the sole benefit of the Parties
and are not for the benefit of any Third Party.

 

6K. _Tax Matters_.

 

(i) Seller shall grant to Buyer (or its designees) access at reasonable times
after the Closing to all of the information, books and records specifically
relating to the Company within the possession or control of Seller or any
Affiliate thereof (or with respect to which Seller has access or can gain
access by the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts) (including
workpapers and correspondence with Tax Authorities), and shall afford Buyer
(or its designees) the right (at Buyers expense) to take
extracts therefrom, and to make copies thereof (to the extent solely related
to the Company), to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Buyer (or its
designees) to prepare Tax Returns, respond to Tax audits and investigations,
prosecute Tax protests, appeals and refund claims and to conduct negotiations
with Tax Authorities. Buyer shall grant or cause the Company to grant to
Seller (or its designees) access at all reasonable times after the Closing to
all of the information, books and records specifically relating to the
Company within the possession or control of Buyer or any Affiliate thereof
(including workpapers and correspondence with Tax Authorities) and to the
Companys employees, and shall afford Seller (or its designees) the right (at
such Sellers expense) to take extracts therefrom, and to make copies thereof
(to the extent solely related to the Company), to the extent reasonably
necessary to permit Seller (or its designees) to prepare Tax Returns, respond
to Tax audits and investigations, prosecute protests, appeals and refund
claims with respect to Taxes and to conduct negotiations with Tax
Authorities. After the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer will each preserve all
information, records or documents in its possession or control relating to
liabilities for Taxes of the Company until six months after the expiration of
any applicable statute of limitations (including extensions thereof) with
respect to the assessment of such Taxes. As soon as practicable after the
Closing Date, Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
and deliver to Buyer any of the Tax Returns and other books and records of
the Company that would have been required to be delivered to Buyer at the
Closing if they had been in Sellers possession or control at such time.

    

(ii) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, real estate transfer,
registration, stamp and similar Taxes and fees (including penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be split and paid for fifty percent (50%) by Seller
and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in timely
making all filings, Tax Returns, reports and forms as may be required to
comply with the provisions of Tax laws implementing such Taxes.

 

(iii) All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements between or among the
Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Company), on the other hand, shall be terminated as of the Closing Date, and,
after the Closing Date, the Company shall not be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder.

 

(iv) Buyer shall not, and shall not cause or permit the Company, or any of
Buyers Affiliates to, file an amended Tax Return with respect to the Company
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period without obtaining the prior written consent of
Seller.

 

(v) The following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility as
between the Parties for certain Tax matters following the Closing Date:

 

(a) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns for or with respect to the Company for all taxable
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, Tax Returns on a combined, consolidated or unitary basis with
Seller) regardless of when they are to be filed. After the Closing, Buyer
shall, and shall cause the Company to cooperate with Seller in the
preparation and filing of such Tax Returns. Except as otherwise provided in
this _Section 6K(v)_ , Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid on the
Companys behalf, the Taxes attributable to the Company with respect to such
taxable periods described above in this _Section 6K(v)_ , but only to the
extent such Taxes were not included in Closing Net Working Capital reflected
in the Final Purchase Price. If such Taxes were included in Closing Net
Working Capital reflected in the Final Purchase Price, Buyer shall be
responsible for and shall pay the amount of such Taxes (including any amounts
due to Seller or any of its Affiliates under any agreements or arrangements
with respect to any liability for, or sharing of, Taxes); if Seller pays such
Taxes on behalf of the Company, Buyer shall reimburse Seller therefor within
fifteen (15) days after receipt by Buyer of written notice that the Taxes
have been paid;

   

(b) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
any Tax Returns of the Company for taxable periods that begin on or before
the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ").
Any Tax Return to be prepared by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 6K(v)(b)_
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with practices followed in prior
years with respect to similar Tax Returns. Buyer shall provide Seller a copy
of such Tax Return reasonably in advance of, and not less than thirty (30)
days prior to, the due date for filing such Tax Return and shall not file
such Tax Return without Sellers written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If Seller disputes any item
on such Tax Returns, within fifteen (15) days following the receipt by Seller
of the applicable Tax Return, Seller shall provide written notice to
Buyer specifying the disputed item (or items) and the basis for its objection
in reasonable detail. If Seller does not object to such Tax Return within
such period, it shall be deemed agreed upon by the Parties and Buyer shall
be permitted to file such Tax Return in the form provided to Seller. Any
disputes between the Parties with respect to such Tax Returns shall be
resolved in accordance with _Section 6K(v)(c)_. If the Parties
cannot resolve any disputed item, the item in question shall be resolved in
accordance with _Section 6K(v)(c)_. Except as otherwise provided in this
_Section 6K(v)(b)_ , Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Buyer within
thirty (30) days after receipt by Seller of written notice that the Taxes
have been paid with respect to such taxable periods an amount equal to the
portion of such Taxes that relates to the portion of such taxable periods
ending at the end of the day on the Closing Date, but only to the extent such
Taxes were not included in Closing Net Working Capital reflected in the Final
Purchase Price. For purposes of this subsection, in the case of any Taxes
that are imposed and are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such
Taxes that relate to the portion of such taxable period ending at the end of
the day on the Closing Date shall, in the case of any Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis (such as real property Taxes) be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire taxable period during which such Taxes
accrue multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in the taxable period ending at the end of the day on the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period.
In the case of non-periodic Taxes ( _i.e._ , such as Taxes that are (w)
based upon or related to income or receipts, (x) imposed in connection with
any capital or debt restructuring, (y) imposed in connection with any
sale, distribution, or other transfer or assignment of property (real or
personal, tangible or intangible) or (z) payroll and similar Taxes), the
portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of such taxable period ending
at the end of the day on the Closing Date shall be determined based on a
closing of the books of the Company at the end of the day on the Closing
Date;

 

(c) The Parties shall attempt to resolve any dispute with respect to any such
Tax Return described in  _Section 6K(v)(b)_ within ten (10) days after Buyer
receives notice of such dispute from Seller. If during such ten (10) day
period any dispute cannot be resolved, the Parties shall, within three (3)
days thereafter, submit the item in question to a mutually agreed upon
arbitrator, which shall be an independent, nationally recognized accounting
firm, to resolve the dispute. If Buyer and Seller are unable to mutually
agree upon such arbitrator within twenty (20) days, either Buyer or Seller
may thereafter request that the American Arbitration Association select an
arbitrator and such selection shall be binding upon the Parties. Such
arbitrator shall be instructed to deliver to the Parties a written
determination of any revisions to the Tax Return within five (5) days after
the date of referral thereof to such arbitrator. The Parties agree to accept
such arbitrators determination of any revisions to the Tax Return. The cost
of the services of such arbitrator shall be borne equally by Buyer
and Seller;

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall be solely responsible for the
payment of Taxes attributable to taxable periods beginning after the Closing
Date and the portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date
(each such Taxable Period or portion thereof, a " _Post-Closing Tax Period_
") and shall indemnify Seller for any Taxes to the extent such Tax results
from or is attributable to actions taken by Buyer or its Affiliates
(including, for this purpose, actions taken by the Company on or after the
Closing Date), and Seller shall be solely responsible for the payment of
Taxes attributable to taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date
and the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date;

   

(e) In the case of any audit, examination, or other proceeding (" _Tax
Proceeding_ ") with respect to any taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date, Buyer shall promptly inform Seller in writing of such Tax
Proceeding. In the event Buyer fails to timely provide Seller with written
notice of such Tax Proceeding, Sellers obligation to indemnify Buyer or its
Affiliates hereunder shall be reduced only to the extent of any Adverse
Consequence arising as a result of such failure to notify. In the case of any
Tax Proceeding subject to this _Section 6K(v)(e)_ , Seller shall
be entitled, at Sellers expense, to control the conduct of such Tax
Proceeding;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall have the right, at
Buyers expense, to attend and participate in such Tax Proceeding and give
comments that Seller shall reasonably consider, but only if and to the extent
such Tax Proceeding does not pertain to or include a combined, unitary,
affiliated group or similar Tax Return that includes Seller or any
of Sellers Affiliates;

 

(f) In the case of a Tax Proceeding relating to any Straddle Period in which
such Tax Proceeding cannot be separated into separate proceedings for the
Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period, Seller (if the claim
for Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period exceeds or reasonably
could be expected to exceed in amount the claim for Post-Closing Tax Period
Taxes), or otherwise Buyer (Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, the " _Tax
Controlling Party_ "), shall be entitled to control such Tax Proceeding;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Tax Controlling Party shall provide the
other party (the " _Tax Non-Controlling Party_ ") with a timely and
reasonably detailed account of each stage of such Tax Proceeding, (ii) the
Tax Controlling Party shall consult with the Tax Non-Controlling Party before
taking any significant action in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (iii)
the Tax Non-Controlling Party shall be entitled to participate in such
Tax Proceeding and attend any meetings or conferences with the relevant
Tax Authority, at its own expense, and (iv) the Tax Controlling Party shall
not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining
the prior written consent of the Tax Non-Controlling Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, if such
settlement, compromise or abandonment could have an adverse impact on the Tax
Non-Controlling Party or any of its Affiliates;

 

(g) Any refund of Taxes paid or payable by or with respect to the Company
shall be promptly paid as follows, or to the extent payable but not paid due
to offset against other Taxes shall be promptly paid by the Party receiving
the benefit of the offset as follows: (i) to Seller if attributable to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, and for any Straddle Period to the extent allocable,
determined in a manner consistent with _Section 6K(v)(b)_ , to the portion
of such Straddle Period beginning before and ending at the end of the Closing
Date; and (ii) to Buyer if attributable to any Post-Closing Tax Period, and
for any Straddle Period to the extent allocable, determined in a manner
consistent with  _Section 6K(v)(b)_ , to the portion of such Straddle Period
beginning after the Closing Date; and

 

(h) Except as otherwise provided herein, on the Closing Date, the Company
shall not incur, and neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall permit or
otherwise allow any the Company to incur, any "extraordinary item" as defined
in U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(C) arising from
transactions not contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6L. _Exclusive Transaction_. Seller agrees that during the Interim
Period, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and each of their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) provide any
non-public information to any third party (including via access to any data
room or other records), other than to Buyer and its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives, in an effort to facilitate such third partys
evaluation of an acquisition of any Interests or other securities of the
Company or all or a material portion of the assets of the Company (a "
_Competing Transaction_ "), (ii) solicit, initiate or encourage
the submission of proposals, offers or inquiries from a third party other
than Buyer with respect to any Competing Transaction, (iii) permit any Person
(other than Buyer and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives) to
conduct any on site diligence with respect to the Company or its assets, (iv)
participate in any negotiations or discussions with any third party other
than Buyer and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives with
respect to any Competing Transaction or (v) enter into any letter of intent
or other binding agreement with any third party other than Buyer with respect
to any Competing Transaction. For purposes of this Agreement, "Competing
Transaction" shall not include a divestiture of the Excluded Assets. 

   

6M. _Further Actions_.

 

(i) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each of Buyer and Seller shall
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions
to Closing to be satisfied and for the Closing to occur as promptly as
possible.

 

(ii) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at any time or
from time to time at or after the Closing, at any of the Parties request and
without further consideration, the other Parties shall execute and deliver to
such Party such other instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment
and confirmation, provide such materials and information and take such other
actions as such Party may reasonably request in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6N. _Data Room_. As soon as practicable after the Closing (but in no event
more than ten (10) Business Days after the Closing Date), Seller shall (a)
record all documents and materials in that virtual data room established on
behalf of Seller and its Affiliates in connection with the sale of the
Company as of the Closing Date onto one or more discs or computer drives for
permanent storage and (b) provide a copy of such discs or computer drives to
Buyer for its records. 

 

6O. _Delivery of Books and Records_. Seller shall, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing (but in no event more than fifteen (15)
Business Days after the Closing Date), deliver to Buyer the books and records
of the Company in the possession or control of Seller or any Affiliate
thereof (to the extent not already in the possession or control of the
Company as of the Closing), including copies of any Tax Returns filed solely
in the name of the Company in the possession or control of Seller or any
Affiliate thereof for all taxable years ending on or prior to the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the delivery to Buyer of any
such books and records, Seller will provide Buyer with access to such books
and records from time to time at the request of Buyer as promptly as
practicable following such request.

 

6P. _Provisions Respecting Representation of the Company_. Each of the
Parties hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors,
managers, members, partners, stockholders, officers, employees and
Affiliates, that Bracewell LLP may serve as counsel to each and any of Seller
and its Affiliates (other than the Company) (individually and collectively,
the " _Seller Group_ "), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, following consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, Bracewell LLP (or any successor) may serve
as counsel to the Seller Group or any director, manager, member, stockholder,
partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of any member of the Seller Group, in
connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
notwithstanding such representation, and each of the Parties (on its own
behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) hereby consents thereto and
irrevocably waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of
such Parties shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to irrevocably
waive any conflict of interest arising from such representation.

   

6Q. _Disposition of Excluded Assets_.

 

(i) Prior to the Closing, and as promptly as commercially reasonably
practicable following the date hereof, Seller shall (a) cause the Company to
transfer all of the Excluded Assets (and their related liabilities) to Seller
or an Affiliate of Seller and (b) accept, or cause Sellers Affiliate to
accept, such transfer of Excluded Assets and to assume all liabilities
related thereto, using assignment and assumption agreements, deeds, and other
appropriate instruments of transfer, each such instrument to be in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer. Subject to the cost allocation
provisions in _Section 6Q(iii)(1)_ , Seller shall be responsible for
remediating any Remediation Event hereunder, and shall keep Buyer reasonably
notified of the progress thereof. In addition to the transfer of title and
assumption of liabilities set forth in the immediately preceding sentence,
Seller shall cause all personal property (excluding any subsurface
improvements or other subsurface assets) included in the Excluded Assets to
be removed from the Owned Real Property in accordance with this _Section 6Q_
and, to the extent reasonably practicable, the Leased Real Property and the
real property in which the Company has any Additional Property Rights, in
each case, prior to the Closing, at Sellers sole cost and expense;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to the Companys Marcus
Hook site, Seller shall remove (x) the buildings, appurtenances and
fixtures (excluding any subsurface improvements or other subsurface assets)
included in the Excluded Assets (the " _Excluded Surface Assets_ ") and (y)
Excluded Assets that consist of subsurface improvements or other subsurface
assets (each, an " _Excluded Subsurface Asset_ "), if and to the
extent located within the area demarcated by the red boundary shown on
_Exhibit L_ , as well as in any other area at the Marcus Hook site
reasonably requested by Buyer, in reasonable detail at least ninety (90) days
prior to the then reasonably anticipated Closing Date, to perform work
related to the addition of facilities to be installed by Buyer at or around
the location of such Excluded Subsurface Asset. Seller shall determine the
manner and method for removing any Excluded Surface Assets and any Excluded
Subsurface Asset. Promptly after the Closing, Seller shall cause all deeds
and related instruments conveying real property interests pursuant to this
_Section 6Q_ to be recorded in the records of the applicable Governmental
Entity and shall be responsible for all costs and fees associated therewith,
and shall furnish Buyer with copies of all such recorded documents.

 

(ii) If, in connection with the removal of any Excluded Subsurface Asset
pursuant to _Section 6Q(i)_ or the construction activities performed by
Buyer and its Affiliates at the Marcus Hook site during the Construction
Period, Seller (prior to the Closing) or Buyer (on or after the Closing)
determines that a Remedial Action is required by applicable Environmental
Laws to remediate any Hazardous Materials existing at the Marcus Hook site
prior to the Closing (a " _Remediation Event_ "), such Party shall promptly
provide written notice to the other Party of such Remediation Event. The
Parties shall coordinate obtaining an estimate of the Remediation Costs, as
estimated by one or more qualified firms reasonably acceptable to the
Parties. Any Remedial Action to remediate a Remediation Event pursuant to
this _Section 6Q_ shall be performed in accordance with applicable
Environmental Laws and the requirements set forth in _Section 8F(iii)(b)_. 

 

(iii) The Parties shall bear the costs of (a) removing the Excluded Surface
Assets and removing prior to the Closing each Excluded Subsurface Asset and
(b) all Remedial Actions to remediate all Remediation Events (net of and
after giving effect to any insurance proceeds actually received by the
Company for such remediation) identified during the Construction Period (the
costs described in  _clauses (a)_ and _(b)_ , collectively, " _Remediation
Costs_ ") as follows, subject to the termination rights set forth in
_Section 6Q(iii)(2)_ and _Section 6Q(iii)(3)_ :

 

(1) The aggregate Remediation Costs shall be allocated between Seller and
Buyer, as follows: 

 

(a) Seller shall bear the first ten million dollars ($10,000,000), if any, of
aggregate Remediation Costs; 

   

(b) Buyer shall bear the next ten million dollars ($10,000,000), if any, of
aggregate Remediation Costs; 

 

(c) Seller and Buyer shall each bear one-half (1/2) of aggregate Remediation
Costs, if any, in excess of twenty million dollars ($20,000,000) up to an
additional twenty million dollars ($20,000,000) (i.e., up to ten million
dollars ($10,000,000) allocated to each Party); _provided_ , _however_ , that
Buyer shall advance, on behalf of Seller, Sellers portion of the Remediation
Costs payable pursuant to this _subparagraph (c)_ (such Sellers
portion advanced by Buyer, if any, the " _Remediation Cost Advances_ "),
subject to an adjustment to the Purchase Price in accordance with
_Section 2A(ii)_ (if the Closing occurs) or repayment pursuant to
_Section 9C_ (if this Agreement is terminated without the occurrence of a
Closing);

 

(d) If Buyer makes the election set forth in _Section 6Q(iii)(3)_ to pay the
Buyer Remediation Election Amount, Buyer shall bear any Remediation Costs in
excess of forty million dollars ($40,000,000); and

 

(e) Otherwise, if Buyer does not make the election set forth in _Section
6Q(iii)(3)_ to pay the Buyer Remediation Election Amount, Seller shall bear
any Remediation Costs in excess of forty million dollars ($40,000,000),
subject to the limitations of liability set forth in _Section 8B(i)(c)(y)_
after giving effect to _Section 6Q(iii)(4)_ (regardless of whether such
liability for Remediation Costs is incurred prior to, on or after
the Closing).

 

(2) If, prior to the Closing, the estimated aggregate Remediation Costs
exceed twenty million dollars ($20,000,000), Seller shall notify Buyer after
Seller becomes aware of such Remediation Costs. During the forty-five (45)
day period following delivery of such notice, Buyer may elect, in its sole
discretion, to terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice of such
termination to Seller. If Buyer does not make such election to terminate this
Agreement during such time period, (x) the Remediation Costs for the
applicable Remediation Event(s) shall be borne in accordance with the cost-
allocation provisions in _Section 6Q(iii)(1)_ , (y) such Remediation Event(s)
shall not affect the Closing and (z) subject to the provisions of the
immediately succeeding sentence, Buyer shall have no further termination
rights pursuant to this  _Section 6Q(iii)(2)_. Notwithstanding the provisions
of  _clause (z)_ in the immediately preceding sentence, if one or more
additional Remediation Events (not substantially related to
previously identified Remediation Events) are identified by Buyer or Seller
that are reasonably expected to result in additional Remediation Costs of at
least $10,000,000 (if the aggregate Remediation Costs, before such additional
costs, are estimated to be less than $30,000,000) or at least $5,000,000 (if
the resulting aggregate Remediation Costs, before such additional costs,
are estimated to be at least $30,000,000), then Buyer shall be entitled to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of this _Section
6Q(iii)(2)_. If such remediation is reasonably expected to be completed
beyond the Outside Date, the Outside Date shall be extended until thirty (30)
days after such remediation is completed; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the Outside Date be extended more than twenty-four (24) months
pursuant to this _Section 6Q(iii)(2)_.

 

(3) If, prior to the Closing, the estimated Remediation Costs exceed forty
million dollars ($40,000,000) in the aggregate, Seller shall notify Buyer
after Seller becomes aware of such Remediation Costs. During the forty-five
(45) day period following delivery of such notice, Buyer may give notice to
Seller that Buyer elects, in its sole discretion, to pay the portion of the
Remediation Costs in excess of forty million dollars ($40,000,000) (the "
_Buyer Remediation Election Amount_ "). If Buyer makes such election, the
Remediation Costs for the applicable Remediation Event(s) shall be borne in
accordance with the cost-allocation provisions in _Section 6Q(iii)(1)_
and such Remediation Event(s) shall not affect the Closing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller will not be responsible for (or required to indemnify
the Buyer Indemnitees for) any Remediation Costs in excess of the amount
contemplated by this _Section 6Q(iii)(3)_ , and the Base Purchase Price will
not be reduced by such excess amount. If Buyer does not make such election
within such forty-five (45) day period, either Party may terminate the
Agreement by delivering written notice of such termination to the other Party
within thirty (30) days after the expiration of such forty-five (45) day
period. If neither Party delivers such notice, (x) the Remediation Costs for
the applicable Remediation Event(s) shall be borne in accordance with the
cost-allocation provisions in _Section 6Q(iii)(1)_ , such
Remediation Event(s) shall not affect the Closing and (y) subject to the
provisions of the immediately succeeding sentence, the Parties shall have no
further termination rights pursuant to this _Section 6Q(iii)(3)_.
Notwithstanding the provisions of _clause (y)_ in the immediately
preceding sentence, if one or more additional Remediation Events (not
substantially related to previously identified Remediation Events) are
identified by Buyer or Seller that are reasonably expected to result in
additional Remediation Costs of at least $10,000,000 (if the resulting
aggregate Remediation Costs, before such additional costs, are estimated to
be at least $50,000,000) or at least $5,000,000 (if the resulting aggregate
Remediation Costs, before such additional costs, are estimated to be at least
$50,000,000), then Buyer shall be entitled to make the election set forth in
the first sentence of this _Section 6Q(iii)(3)_ , and, if Buyer does not make
such election within the forty-five (45) day period set forth above, either
Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the
provisions of this  _Section 6Q(iii)(3)_. If such remediation is reasonably
expected to be completed beyond the Outside Date, the Outside Date shall be
extended until thirty (30) days after such remediation is completed;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Outside Date be extended
more than twenty-four (24) months pursuant to this _Section 6Q(iii)(3)_.

   

(4) Any Remediation Costs paid or payable by Seller or its Affiliates
pursuant to this _Section 6Q(iii)_ shall be treated as indemnity payments made
by Seller pursuant to _Section 8B(i)(9)_ for purposes of applying, and
subject to, the aggregate liability limitation set forth in 
_Section 8B(i)(c)(y)_.

 

6R. _Title Cooperation_. Seller shall, and shall cause the Company to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer to obtain land
title surveys and/or customary title insurance coverage with respect to any
Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property, including by providing (i)
Buyers surveyor with reasonable access during normal business hours to any
such real property and (ii) duly executed title affidavits in form customary
for the jurisdiction in which such real property is located; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Seller be obligated to indemnify the
title company or provide any non-imputation affidavits. Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and hold Seller, the Company and their respective
Representatives harmless from any and all Losses arising out of or resulting
from any accident or injury caused by Buyers surveyor while on the Company
Owned Property or Company Leased Property except to the extent caused by the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller, the Company or any of their
respective Representatives attributable to any period prior to the Closing
Date. Buyer shall be solely responsible for all costs and fees incurred by
any Party, the Company or their respective Representatives in connection with
this _Section 6R_.

 

6S. _Casualty_. If, during the Interim Period, any portion of the Companys
assets is materially damaged, lost or destroyed by casualty loss or is taken
in condemnation or under right of eminent domain (a " _Casualty Loss_ "),
Seller shall promptly provide written notice of such Casualty Loss to Buyer.

 

(i) If the cost of restoring, repairing or replacing a Casualty Loss to a
condition reasonably comparable to its prior condition (as estimated by a
qualified firm reasonably acceptable to the Parties, net of and after giving
effect to (x) any insurance proceeds available to the Company for such
restoration and (y) the Buyer Casualty Election Amount, if any) (the "
_Restoration Cost_ ") is greater than $250,000 but does not
exceed $20,000,000, Seller may elect to restore, repair or replace the
Casualty Loss to a condition reasonably comparable to its prior condition and
such Casualty Loss shall not affect the Closing.

 

(1) If Seller elects to restore, repair or replace the Casualty Loss and such
restoration, repair or replacement is reasonably expected to be completed
beyond the Outside Date, the Outside Date shall be extended until thirty (30)
days after such restoration, repair or replacement is completed; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Outside Date be extended more than
twelve (12) months pursuant to this _Section 6S(i)(1)_. 

 

(2) If Seller elects not to restore, repair or replace the Casualty Loss,
Seller shall notify Buyer and within forty-five (45) days of Buyers receipt
of such notice, Buyer may elect to (A) reduce the amount of the Base Purchase
Price by the estimated Restoration Cost (as estimated by a qualified firm
reasonably acceptable to the Parties), by notice to Seller, and such Casualty
Loss shall not affect the Closing or (B) terminate this Agreement. If Buyer
does not make any election within such forty-five (45) day period, the Base
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the estimated Restoration Cost (as
estimated by a qualified firm reasonably acceptable to the Parties) and the
Casualty Loss shall not affect the Closing. 

   

(ii) If the Restoration Cost is in excess of $20,000,000, Seller shall notify
Buyer after Seller becomes aware of the Restoration Costs with respect to the
applicable Casualty Loss, and during the forty-five (45) day period following
delivery of such notice, Buyer may give notice to Seller that Buyer elects,
in its sole discretion, to pay the portion of the Restoration Costs in excess
of $20,000,000 (the " _Buyer Casualty Election Amount_ "). If Buyer makes such
election, Seller shall then make the election set forth in _Section 6S(i)_
;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, Seller will
not be responsible for costs of repair, and the Base Purchase Price will not
be reduced by any amount, as the case may be, in excess of the amount
contemplated by _Section 6S(i)_. If Buyer does not make such election within
such forty-five (45) day period, then either Party may terminate the
Agreement by delivering written notice of such termination to the other Party
within thirty (30) days after the expiration of such forty-five (45) day
period. If neither Party delivers such notice, the Base Purchase Price shall
be reduced by the Restoration Cost and the Casualty Loss shall not affect the
Closing.

 

(iii) If the Restoration Cost is $250,000 or less, (A) this Agreement shall
not terminate and (B) there shall be no reduction in the amount of the Base
Purchase Price.

 

6T. _Insurance_. Buyer shall be solely responsible for providing (i) insurance
to the Company for any claims made in connection with the insurance policies
described on _Schedule 4L_ of the Company Disclosure Letter after
the Closing, regardless of when the event or occurrence relating to any claim
arose and (ii) for any event or occurrence after the Closing.

 

6U. _PHMSA_. If, within three (3) years after the Closing Date, PHMSA
provides written notice of rejection, or a notice of violation with respect
to, the results of the Hydrostatic Test submitted to PHMSA in connection with
the Southern Mainlines conversion to natural gas service, Seller shall
reimburse Buyer for the reasonable out-of-pocket cost and expenses up to
$10,000,000 of performing one (1) additional hydrostatic test of the Southern
Mainline. 

 

6V. _Seller s Letter of Credit Obligations_. As credit support for its
obligations under this Agreement, and in addition to issuing and maintaining
the Seller Guaranty, Seller shall be obligated to deliver to Buyer and
maintain a Letter of Credit or substitute cash collateral as follows: 

 

(i) As promptly as commercially reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement, and in any event within fifteen (15) days following the date
of this Agreement, Seller shall deliver to Buyer the initial Letter of
Credit. Seller shall maintain in full force and effect the Letter of Credit
until the earlier of (A) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms and (B) ten (10) years after the Closing Date (the " _Letter of
Credit Termination Date_ "). The Letter of Credit shall at all times have a
stated amount equal to the Letter of Credit Amount. Seller shall not be
required to replenish any Letter of Credit (or cash collateral) amounts that
have been drawn or are held as cash collateral by Buyer, unless and to the
extent that, prior to the Closing, the stated amount of the Letter of Credit
is less than the Letter of Credit Amount. The Letter of Credit may be
substituted at any time by Seller with a substitute Letter of Credit with a
stated amount equal to the Letter of Credit Amount and Buyer shall promptly
return the substituted Letter of Credit as directed by Seller upon receipt of
such substitute Letter of Credit. The Letter of Credit shall provide that
Buyer may, and Buyer shall be entitled to, draw on the Letter of Credit
in the event of a termination of this Agreement prior to the Closing in
accordance with _Section 9C_ or for any costs or damages due and payable
by Seller and/or Seller Indemnitees to Buyer Indemnitees under _Article 8_
and the Precedent Agreements. The Letter of Credit shall provide that Buyer
may, and Buyer shall be entitled to, draw the full amount of such letter of
credit and hold such amount as cash collateral for application to
such liabilities of Seller due and payable hereunder if the Letter of Credit
is not renewed or extended from time to time at least thirty (30) days before
its expiration date. In the event of a Qualified Institution Default, Seller
shall (1) provide a substitute Letter of Credit that is issued by a
Qualified Institution or (2) deliver to Buyer cash collateral for application
to such liabilities of Seller due and payable hereunder in an amount equal to
the Letter of Credit Amount, in either case within five (5) Business Days
after Seller receives notice of the Qualified Institution Default. If Seller
(x) fails to provide the initial Letter of Credit in accordance with this
_Section 6V(i)_ , (y) fails to provide a substitute Letter of Credit or such
cash collateral in accordance with this _Section 6V(i)_ or (z) otherwise
breaches the requirements of this _Section 6V(i)_ , any such event shall
constitute a material breach by Seller under this Agreement. In all cases,
the reasonable costs and expenses of establishing, renewing, substituting,
canceling, increasing, reducing, or otherwise administering the Letter of
Credit shall be borne by Seller.

   

(ii) In the event that at any time Buyer is the holder of cash collateral,
Buyer shall deposit such cash collateral into a separate escrow account at a
Qualified Institution, and such cash collateral shall not be commingled with
any accounts of Buyer. Buyer shall have the right to withdraw and apply such
cash collateral in the event of a termination of this Agreement prior to the
Closing in accordance with  _Section 9C_ or for any costs or damages due and
payable by Seller and/or Seller Indemnitees to Buyer Indemnitees under
_Article 8_.

 

(iii) Within three (3) Business Days following the Letter of Credit
Termination Date, Buyer shall return as directed by Seller the Letter of
Credit if any amount remains undrawn and any remaining cash collateral held
pursuant to this _Section 6V_.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyers
remedies under this Agreement are cumulative. For the avoidance of doubt,
neither the Letter of Credit or cash collateral held pursuant to this
_Section 6V_ shall be Buyers sole or primary remedy for recovering amounts
that Seller is required to pay Buyer pursuant to this Agreement (including
pursuant to _Section 8B_ and _Section 9C_ ), and Buyer shall be entitled to
pursue any or all remedies available to it under this Agreement in lieu of,
or in addition to, drawing on the Letter of Credit or withdrawing cash
collateral in accordance with this _Section 6V_.

 

6W. _Cure of Defects and Obtaining Additional Real Property Interests_. Prior
to the Closing, Seller shall provide evidence and information to Buyer to
reasonably demonstrate the resolution of the potential defects identified
on  _Schedule 4I(iv)(A)_ (ROW Defect Summary) and _Schedule 4I(iv)(B)_ (ROW
North Segment Product Restrictions Bucks and Northampton) of the Company
Disclosure Letter. To the extent Seller is not able to demonstrate the
resolution of any such defect in any material respect to the reasonable
satisfaction of Buyer, prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the Company
to use commercially reasonable efforts to cure such unresolved
defects, including by obtaining additional rights to transport gas for those
parcels of real property, identified on _Schedule 4I(iv)(A)_ and  _Schedule
4I(iv)(B)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all rights-of-way and related instruments curing
or conveying real property interests pursuant to this  _Section 6W_ to be
recorded in the records of the applicable Governmental Entity prior to the
Closing and shall furnish Buyer with copies of all such recorded
documents. To the extent Seller fails to complete the activities described in
the preceding two sentences prior to the Closing, Buyer may cause the Company
to complete such activities from and after the Closing. Seller shall be
responsible for all costs and fees associated with such activities, whether
conducted by Seller prior to the Closing or Buyer from and after the Closing,
set forth in this  _Section 6W_.

   

6X. _Martins Creek Control Room Matters_.

 

(i) Prior to the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and
execute a shared facilities agreement and related easements for a term ending
on the one-year anniversary of the Closing (or, if earlier, the completion of
the new control room described in the next sentence), which agreement and
easements shall (a) grant to Seller and its Affiliates certain access and use
rights with respect to such existing Company control room building and common
facilities, which access and use rights are summarized in _Exhibit K_
attached hereto, and (b) provide for Sellers continued consumption of
electricity provided by the local electric utility that currently serves the
existing Company control room, with Seller reimbursing Buyer for (x) such
electricity consumed at Buyers cost and (y) the demand charge paid by Buyer
for such electricity.

 

(ii) Prior to the one-year anniversary of the Closing, Seller shall construct
or cause to be constructed a new control room building, located on real
property that Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company) own, lease or
use at such time (other than any lease or right to use granted by Buyer or
the Company), that is separate from the existing Company control room
building located at the Martins Creek Terminal that will allow Seller or its
Affiliates to independently operate the Martins Creek Terminal after such
one-year anniversary; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in constructing such new
control room, Buyer agrees to allow Seller, at its option, to splice or
otherwise interconnect the new wiring for the controls located in such new
control room building with the existing wiring from the Martins Creek
Terminal facilities at a point within the existing Company control room
building.

 

(iii) From and after the Closing, Seller shall grant to Buyer a perpetual
easement to access and consume water, free of charge, from the potable water
well located on that portion of the Martins Creek Terminal Property retained
by Seller. With respect to electricity service required to power Sellers new
control room, Seller shall be responsible for acquiring a new service
interconnection with the local electric utility; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if the installation costs of such new electricity service to Seller
exceed $100,000, Seller may request Buyer to continue providing Seller with
electricity at Buyers cost, and Buyer agrees to negotiate in good faith such
an arrangement with Seller so long as such resulting arrangement is in
compliance with all Laws and does not cause Buyer to become a public utility
under state or federal Law. 

 

(iv) Following the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company to grant Seller
easements across the Companys real property (except as set forth in _Exhibit
K_ , not including any access to the interior of the Companys control room
building) reasonably requested by Seller to allow ingress and egress
(including use of access roads and the Companys parking lot) with respect to
the new control room building in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with Buyers or the Companys business or operations.

_Section 4M_ (Tax Matters) exceed an amount equal to one hundred percent

Buyer contained in this Agreement (other than a Post-Closing Covenant)
or (iii) any breach of any Post-Closing Covenant of Buyer contained in
this Agreement.

 

8D. _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(i) If a Buyer Indemnitee or a Seller Indemnitee (each, an " _Indemnified
Entity_ ") believes that a Claim, demand or other circumstance exists that
has given, or may reasonably be expected to give, rise to a right of
indemnification under this _Article 8_ (whether or not the amount of Losses
relating thereto is then quantifiable), such Indemnified Entity shall assert
its Claim for indemnification by giving written notice thereof (a "
_Claim Notice_ ") to the party from which indemnification is sought (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") as promptly as reasonably possible but in any event,
(a) if the event or occurrence giving rise to such Claim (a " _Third Party
Claim_ ") for indemnification is, or relates to, a Claim, brought by a Person
not a party to this Agreement or affiliated with any such Indemnified Entity
(a " _Third Party_ "), within fifteen (15) Business Days following receipt
of notice of such Claim by such Indemnified Entity, or (b) if the event or
occurrence giving rise to such Claim for indemnification is not, or does
not relate to, a Claim brought by a Third Party, within thirty (30) days
after the discovery by the Indemnified Entity of the circumstances giving
rise to such Claim for indemnity. Each Claim Notice shall describe the Claim
in reasonable detail, including the nature of, and factual and legal basis
for, any such Claim for indemnification (to the extent reasonably
practicable), and the provisions of this Agreement upon which such Claim for
indemnification is made. The failure by the Indemnified Entity to timely
notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
indemnification obligation hereunder except to the extent that the defense of
such Claim is materially prejudiced by the failure to give such timely
notice. After delivery of the Claim Notice, the Indemnified Entity shall
deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within five (5) Business Days after the
Indemnified Entitys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Entity relating to the
Third Party Claim.

 

(ii) If any Claim by an Indemnified Entity under this _Article 8_ relates to
a Claim filed or made against an Indemnified Entity by a Third Party,
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense
thereof and may elect at any time (subject to the other provisions of this
_Article 8_ ) to negotiate a settlement or a compromise of such Claim or to
defend such Claim with its own counsel. Should an Indemnifying Party elect to
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not
be liable to the Indemnified Entity for legal expenses subsequently incurred
by the Indemnified Entity in connection with the defense thereof. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Entity shall have
the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its
own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it
being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall control such
defense; _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to any matter that, in
the written opinion of the Indemnified Entitys counsel, there is a material
conflict of interest between the Indemnified Entity and the Indemnifying
Party, the Indemnified Entity shall be entitled to control such defense, to
the extent of the matter giving rise to such conflict and subject to the
Indemnifying Partys right to participate in such defense. Except with the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Entity, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, no Indemnifying Party shall
settle or compromise any such Third Party Claim or permit a default judgment
or consent to an entry of judgment unless such settlement, compromise or
judgment (a) relates solely to money damages, (b) provides for a full,
unconditional and irrevocable release of the Indemnified Entity with respect
to the Claim(s) being settled and (c) does not contain any admission or
finding of wrongdoing on behalf of the Indemnified Entity. Whether or not the
Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim,
neither the Indemnified Entity nor any of its Affiliates shall admit
any liability with respect to, consent to the entry of any judgment, or
settle, compromise or discharge, any Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). If the Indemnifying Party
chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, the Parties shall, and shall cause
their officers, directors, employees and Affiliates to, cooperate in the
defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the
provision to the Indemnifying Party of all records and information reasonably
available to such Indemnified Entity relating to such Claim, and making such
Persons available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The party in
charge of the defense shall keep the other Parties fully apprised at all
times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with
respect thereto.

   

8E. _General_.

 

(i) The amount of any and all Losses under this _Article 8_ shall be
determined net of (a) the value of any net Tax benefits actually realized by
any Indemnified Entity or its Affiliates arising from any deductions or other
Tax savings resulting from any such Losses prior to the end of the second
taxable year ending after the date of such Loss and (b) any amounts actually
recovered by an Indemnified Entity or its Affiliates under or pursuant to any
insurance policy, indemnity, reimbursement arrangement or Contract
(collectively, " _Alternative Arrangements_ ").

 

(ii) The Buyer Indemnitees shall, and shall cause their Affiliates and
respective Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with Seller and to take
all reasonable actions, in its respective ordinary course of business, to
avoid, minimize and mitigate Losses that would otherwise be subject to
indemnification under _Section 8B_.

 

(iii) Subject to the rights of any insurance carriers contemplated in
_Section 8E(i)_ above, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to any
right of action that the Indemnified Entity may have against any other Person
with respect to any matter giving rise to a Claim for indemnification
hereunder to the extent of the Indemnifying Partys obligation to indemnify
such Indemnified Entity hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the
preceding sentence, any Indemnified Entity receiving an indemnification
payment pursuant to the preceding sentence shall execute, upon the written
request of the Indemnifying Party, any instrument reasonably necessary to
evidence such subrogation of rights. 

 

(iv) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing
(except for disputes under _Section 2C_ , which disputes will be resolved in
accordance with the dispute mechanism set forth in _Section 2C_ and
the obtaining of injunctive or other equitable relief as provided in _Section
10P_ ), its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all
Claims, whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other Laws or
otherwise (including any Claims arising under any Environmental Laws),
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and the Company Disclosure
Letter and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be pursuant
to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article 8_.

   

(v) If any fact, circumstance or condition forming a basis for a Claim for
indemnification under this _Article 8_ shall overlap with any fact,
circumstance, condition, agreement or event forming the basis of any other
Claim for indemnification under this _Article 8_ there shall be no
duplication in the calculation of the amount of Losses.

 

(vi) Except (a) in the case of actual, intentional fraud or (b) to the extent
such Losses are asserted by a third party against an Indemnified Entity, no
Indemnified Entity shall be entitled to recover or make a Claim for any
amounts in respect of, and in no event shall "Losses" be deemed to include,
consequential, punitive, special or exemplary damages. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if any Buyer Indemnitee is indemnified for
Losses pursuant to any provision of this  _Article 8_ by Seller, such Buyer
Indemnitee shall not be entitled to double recovery of any amount related to
the same Losses under this Agreement.

 

(vii) Buyer shall not have any right to indemnification under this Agreement
from and against any Losses related to Taxes of any Person that (a) are
attributable to taxable periods (or portions thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date (except to the extent of any Loss that results directly from the
breach of the representation in  _Section 4M(vii)_ ), (b) are due to the
unavailability in any taxable period (or portion hereof) beginning after the
Closing Date of any net operating losses, credits or other Tax attribute from
a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date
or (c) are directly attributable to any breach by Buyer or, after the
Closing, the Company, of any provision of this Agreement. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, indemnification for breach of any representation or warranty
contained in _Section 4M_ shall be limited to Losses incurred with respect to
the Pre-Closing Tax Periods (except to the extent of any Loss that results
directly from the breach of the representation in _Section 4M(vii)_ ).

 

(viii) Any Contingent Payment or indemnity payments under this Agreement
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

 

(ix) THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE
APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT THE LIABILITIES IN QUESTION AROSE OUT OF OR
RESULTED FROM, SOLELY OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR
COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR
VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY INDEMNIFIED ENTITY.

 

(x) If the Closing occurs, except for the Parties rights to specific
performance set forth in this Agreement and the Parties rights under the
Ancillary Documents in accordance with their respective terms, and except in
the case of actual and intentional fraud by a Party hereto, the
indemnification obligations set forth in this  _Article 8_ shall be the
exclusive remedies for the Parties arising out of, resulting from or related
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

8F. _Environmental Matters_.

 

(i) Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify Buyer or any other Buyer
Indemnitee under this Agreement from and against any Losses that would
otherwise be subject to indemnification regarding Environmental Laws under
_Section 8B(i)(9)_ to the extent any such Losses result directly from, or
with respect to which a reasonably foreseeable proximate cause was, any
voluntary environmental sampling or other surface or subsurface environmental
investigation of the Company Real Property (" _Voluntary Environmental
Testing_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that such Voluntary Environmental
Testing shall not be deemed voluntary if (a) (1) required by Environmental
Law or ordered by a Governmental Entity with jurisdiction and authority to
require such investigation, (2) with respect to any Company Real Property
other than Owned Real Property, is performed by or on behalf of the
applicable landlord or land owner or (3) with respect to any property
adjacent to any Company Real Property, performed by or on behalf of any party
other than Buyer or any Affiliate thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in
the case of each of _clauses (1)_ , _(2)_ and _(3)_ , neither Buyer nor
any Affiliate thereof has taken any steps or actions to initiate or encourage
such demand or performance outside of the ordinary course of business or
(b) performed by Buyer as the result of the discovery of Hazardous Substances
in conjunction with operation, maintenance or construction activities
undertaken in the Companys ordinary course of business, including in
connection with the conversion of the Southern Mainline to natural gas
service; _provided_ _further_ that Seller expressly acknowledges and
agrees that any geotechnical testing, site surveys and soil load analysis of
Company Real Property performed in the course of engineering, design or
construction of improvements on the Company Real Property shall not
constitute Voluntary Environmental Testing and shall not be deemed to limit
Sellers indemnification obligations under this Agreement; _provided_
_further_ that the performance of post-Closing testing or sampling to
analyze potential indoor exposures of Persons to Hazardous Substances at
Company Real Property, the presence of Hazardous Substances in air emissions,
wastewater or stormwater discharges or waste characterization from business
operations shall not be deemed to limit Sellers indemnification obligations
under this Agreement so long as such testing or sampling (x) serves a
legitimate business purpose and (y) would be consistent with the actions
taken by a reasonably prudent operator without regard to the possible
existence of a right to indemnification under this Agreement.

   

(ii) In addition to any other limitations on indemnification that may apply,
with respect to any Claim for indemnification that any of the Buyer
Indemnitees may assert regarding Environmental Laws under _Section 8B(i)(1)_
or _Section 8B(i)(9)_ , Seller shall not have any obligation with respect to
such Claim to the extent the Losses for which indemnification is sought (a)
arise out of any action to meet a cleanup or remedial standard
under Environmental Law that is more stringent or costly than the minimum
standard required by the relevant Governmental Entity with jurisdiction and
authority or which does not employ any available risk-based standards or
institutional controls unless required by a Governmental Entity with
jurisdiction and authority, or (b) are ordinary costs of any post-Closing
decommissioning, construction, demolition or renovation of any asset of the
Company unless directly related to (or with respect to which a reasonably
foreseeable proximate cause was) the presence or release, prior to the
Closing Date, of (x) fuel oil, crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons or (y)
transportation or storage of any fuel oil, crude oil or other liquid
hydrocarbons.

 

(iii) With respect to any Losses for which Seller is required to indemnify
and defend Buyer Indemnitees regarding Environmental Laws pursuant to
_Section 8B(i)(1)_ or  _Section 8B(i)(9)_ , and that requires any Remedial
Action to respond to, remove or otherwise address such Losses, such Remedial
Action shall be subject to the following requirements: (a) Buyer shall design
and conduct the Remedial Action in compliance with all applicable
Environmental Laws and as directed by the appropriate Governmental Entity;
(b) Buyer and Seller agree that any Remedial Action undertaken will be
reasonable and cost-effective, utilizing the least stringent cleanup levels
or standards established for the property that allow for its intended use as
part of Companys business as a natural gas pipeline permissible under
Environmental Laws and acceptable to the relevant Governmental Entity
(including risk based cleanup standards and site specific cleanup standards),
and Buyer agrees to accept customary deed restrictions or restrictive
covenants and/or engineering and institutional controls required to meet such
cleanup standards, in each case, that would not unreasonably interfere with
the use of the Company Real Property based on the operations and use of
the Company Real Property for purposes of the Companys business as a natural
gas pipeline; and (c) Seller shall have the right to reasonably participate
in the planning and design of any Remedial Action. Prior to the
implementation of any material phase of the Remedial Action, Buyer shall
provide Seller with written proposed plans, workplans, sampling
locations maps and schedules for Sellers review and approval, such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyer shall have the
right to negotiate and reach agreement with Governmental Entities as to the
nature, timing and scope of the Remedial Action; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that: (1) Buyer shall provide to Seller in a timely manner any
material correspondence received from or submitted to a Governmental Entity
relating to such Remedial Action; (2) Buyer shall, to the extent practicable,
afford Seller timely access to any studies, reports, protocols, drawings,
charts, workplans, reports, risk assessments, schedules or other
documentation relating to a Remedial Action prior to submission to a
Governmental Entity; (3) to the extent practicable, Buyer shall provide
Seller with timely notice of and an opportunity to attend and participate in
any meetings or hearings with Governmental Entities (including telephonic
conferences) relating to any Remedial Action; and (4) Buyer shall consult
with, and consider in good faith any comments of, Seller in preparing all
material strategies and plans concerning a Remedial Action as contemplated
hereunder. In the event that any Remedial Action could reasonably be expected
to result in Losses exceeding one million dollars ($1,000,000), Seller shall
have the right, in its sole discretion, to conduct the Remedial Action in
accordance with all applicable Environmental Laws and to negotiate and reach
agreement with Governmental Entities as to the nature, timing and scope
of the Remedial Action; _provided_ _further_ that, should Seller elect to
conduct such Remedial Action, Seller shall: (1) keep Buyer reasonably
informed relating to the progress of such Remedial Action (including
providing Buyer with, to the extent affecting ongoing business operations,
the opportunity to participate in any meetings (whether in person
or telephonic) with Governmental Entities) and provide reasonable opportunity
for Buyer to comment on any proposed activities (including any material
written communications with Governmental Entities) relating to resolving such
Remedial Action (and Seller agrees to consider in good faith any reasonable
comments of Buyer); (2) select counsel, contractors and consultants of
recognized standing and competence in connection with such Remedial Action;
(3) diligently and promptly pursue the resolution thereof; and (4) not
prevent or unreasonably interfere with the ordinary course operations of the
Company or the use of the Company Real Property; _provided_ _further_ that in
the event the resolution of a Remedial Action could reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the Buyers ongoing operation or the
Company Real Property after the Closing, Sellers defense and control of such
Remedial Action, including the disclosure, investigation,
negotiation, performance and settlement thereof, shall be subject to Buyers
participation and consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Buyer will, and will cause the Company and its
Representatives to, permit Seller and its Representatives to have reasonable
access to the Company Real Property in connection with such Remedial Action.

Authorizations have not been obtained by the date that is twelve (12) months
after the date of this Agreement (or the end of the first twelve (12) month
extension, as applicable) and (B) the lack of any such Governmental
Authorizations is the sole reason that the unwaived conditions set forth in

" _Outside Date_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) Buyer shall not be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 9A(i)_ if the

a material breach by Seller of any of its representations, warranties,

breach has not been waived by Buyer) and such violation or breach is not
capable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been

thereof from Buyer and (b) the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9A(ii)_ shall

capable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been
cured prior to the earlier of (a) twenty (20) days after written notice
thereof from Seller and (b) the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9A(iii)_
shall not be available to Seller at any time that Seller has violated, or is
in breach of, any covenant, representation or warranty hereunder if such
breach has prevented satisfaction of any condition to the obligation of Buyer
to consummate the Closing (and such violation has not been waived by Buyer)
and such violation or breach is not capable of being cured, or, if capable of
being cured, has not been cured by Seller; _provided_ _further_ that, for
purposes of this _Section 9A(iii)_ , the introductory paragraph to each of
_Articles 3_ and  _4_ shall be read so as to exclude the phrase "as of the
date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date."

 

(iv) by Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, in writing if

of the initial Letter of Credit pursuant to _Section 6V(i)_ , the Letter of
Credit (or a substitute Letter of Credit delivered to Buyer in accordance
with  _Section 6V(i)_ ) has not been delivered or ceases to be in full force

this Agreement by Buyer or Seller, as provided in _Section 9A_ , (a) this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and of no further force or effect
(except that this _Section 9B_ , the last sentence of _Section 6A(i)_ ,
_clauses (i)_ and _(iii)_ of _Section 6D_ ,  _Section 6E_ , _Section 6J(vii)_
,  _Section 6P_ and _Article 10_ shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and shall be continue to be enforceable by the Parties), and (b)
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Buyer or Seller with
respect to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding
_clause (b)_ of this  _Section 9B_ , following a termination of this
Agreement (w) liability shall exist for breach of, or otherwise with respect
to, the provisions of this Agreement specified in the parenthetical contained
in  _clause (a)_ of this _Section 9B_ , (x) liability shall exist for
willful breaches of this Agreement by any Party prior to the time of such
termination, (y) nothing shall limit the right of Seller or Buyer to bring or
maintain any claim, suit, action or proceeding for injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief prior to such termination, subject to
the terms of _Section 10P_ and (z) nothing shall limit the right of Seller
to bring or maintain any claim, suit, action or proceeding against Buyer or
any other Buyer Party arising out of or in connection with any breach of
either Confidentiality Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, if Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9A(iii)_
and retains the Initial Payment in accordance with _Section 9C_ , then the
amount of the Initial Payment will be credited against any award of damages
actually received by Seller in accordance with this _Section 9B_.

   

9C. _Disposition of Initial Payment, Remediation Cost Advances and Letter of
Credit_. 

 

(i) If this Agreement is terminated by Buyer prior to the Closing pursuant to
_Section 9A(ii)_ or _9A(vi)_ , (a) the Initial Payment shall be repaid to
Buyer by Seller (together with interest thereon at the Prime Rate) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds within three (3) Business Days of
such termination, free of any claims by Seller or any other Person with
respect thereto, (b) an amount equal to the total Remediation Cost Advances,
if any, shall be paid to Buyer by Seller (together with interest thereon at
the Prime Rate) by wire transfer of immediately available funds within three
(3) Business Days of such termination, free of any claims by Seller or any
other Person with respect thereto, (c) Buyer shall be entitled to draw on the
Letter of Credit (or any cash collateral held pursuant to _Section 6V_ ) up to
the amount equal to the damages actually incurred by Buyer (as supported by
reasonable evidence of any out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
Buyer) and without duplication of any reimbursable costs recovered by Buyer
under the Precedent Agreements and, thereafter, subject to the payment in
full by Seller of the amount set forth in _clause (b)_ , Buyer shall promptly
return as directed by Seller the Letter of Credit if any amount remains
undrawn and any remaining cash collateral held pursuant to  _Section 6V_ ,
and (d) the Parties will have no further obligation or liability to one
another hereunder other than as set forth in  _Section 9B_ and this _Section
9C_.

 

(ii) If this Agreement is terminated (a) by Seller prior to the Closing
pursuant to _Section 9A(iii)_ or _9A(v)_ or (b) by either Buyer or Seller
prior to the Closing pursuant to _Section 9A(vii)_ , then (x) Seller shall, as
its sole and exclusive remedy for such termination (except as otherwise forth
in _Section 9B)_ , retain the Initial Payment free of any claims by Buyer or
any other Person with respect thereto, (y) an amount equal to the total
Remediation Cost Advances, if any, shall be paid to Buyer by Seller (together
with interest thereon at the Prime Rate) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds within three (3) Business Days of such termination, free of
any claims by Seller or any other Person with respect thereto, and (z) the
Parties will have no further obligation or liability to one another hereunder
other than as set forth in _Section 9B_ and this _Section 9C_ , and it
is expressly stipulated by the Parties that the actual amount of damages
resulting from any such termination by Seller would be difficult, if not
impossible, to determine accurately because of the unique nature of this
Agreement, and the unique nature of the Interests and the Company, and that
such liquidated damages provided or herein are a reasonable estimate by the
Parties of such damages. In addition, subject to the payment in full by
Seller of the amount set forth in  _clause (y)_ , Buyer shall promptly
return, as directed by Seller, the Letter of Credit and any cash collateral
held pursuant to  _Section 6V,_ and the Parties will have no further
obligation or liability to one another hereunder with respect thereto.

 

(iii) If this Agreement is terminated by either Buyer or Seller for any
reason prior to the Closing (except as described in _Section 9C(i)_ or
_9C(ii)_ ), then (a) Seller shall repay to Buyer one-half of the Initial
Payment (without interest) by wire transfer of immediately available funds
within three (3) Business Days of such termination, (b) an amount equal to
the total Remediation Cost Advances, if any, shall be paid to Buyer by
Seller (together with interest thereon at the Prime Rate) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within three (3) Business Days of such
termination, free of any claims by Seller or any other Person with
respect thereto, (c) Buyer shall retain the remainder of the Initial Payment,
free of any claims by Buyer or any other Person with respect thereto, and (d)
the Parties will have no further obligation or liability to one another
hereunder other than as set forth in _Section 9B_ and this _Section 9C_. In
addition, subject to the payment in full by Seller of the amount set forth in
_clause (b)_ , Buyer shall promptly return, as directed by Seller, the
Letter of Credit and any cash collateral held pursuant to _Section 6V,_ and
the Parties will have no further obligation or liability to one another
hereunder with respect thereto.

10B. _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid

prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provisions or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable
and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof.

sections that are specifically for the benefit of any such Persons, each of
which is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby or
entitled to be paid thereunder and may be enforced by such Persons. The

and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with this
Agreement without notice or liability to any other Person. Consequently,
Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and
warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

(whether at law or in equity, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon,

NEW YORK, NEW YORK WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION). BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF

COURTS FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH SUIT,
ACTION OR PROCEEDING. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT VENUE WOULD BE
PROPER IN SUCH COURT, AND HEREBY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION THAT ANY SUCH COURT IS
AN IMPROPER OR INCONVENIENT FORUM FOR THE RESOLUTION OF SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING. EACH OF THE PARTIES FURTHER IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
CONSENTS TO SERVICE OF PROCESS IN THE MANNER PROVIDED FOR NOTICES IN
_SECTION 10A_ OF THIS AGREEMENT. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL AFFECT THE
RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER

10I. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned (including by operation of Law) by
any of the Parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other
Party;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller may assign any or all of its
rights under this Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates so long as,
unless otherwise agreed by Buyer in writing, Seller remains liable for all
obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this

characterize or in any way affect any provision of this Agreement, and all

caption or description of the Company Disclosure Letter had been used in this

10K. _Construction_. Notwithstanding the fact that this Agreement has been
drafted or prepared by one of the Parties, each of the Parties
hereby confirms that they and their respective counsel have reviewed,
negotiated and adopted this Agreement as the joint agreement and
understanding of the Parties and the language used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any
Person. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises with respect to this Agreement, the terms and provisions of the
execution version of this Agreement shall control and prior drafts of this
Agreement shall not be considered or analyzed for any purpose (including in
support of parole evidence proffered by any Person in connection with this
Agreement).

 

10L. _Amendment and Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended or any
provision of this Agreement may be waived; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
any amendment or waiver shall be binding only if such amendment or waiver is
set forth in a writing executed by Seller and Buyer and (ii) subject to the
first sentence of _Section 7C_ with respect to the waiver of conditions to
Closing as of the Closing, any waiver of any provision of this Agreement
shall be effective against Seller or Buyer only if set forth in a writing
executed by such Person. No course of dealing between or among any Persons
having any interest in this Agreement shall be deemed effective to modify,
amend or discharge any part of this Agreement or any rights or obligations of
any person under or by reason of this Agreement. No waiver by any Party of
any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall
be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any other term or
condition of this Agreement on any future occasion.

 

10M. _Company Disclosure Letter_.

 

(i) Disclosing a matter in any section of the Company Disclosure Letter shall
be deemed to be a disclosure for purposes of other sections of the Company
Disclosure Letter only if and to the extent that the relevance of such matter
to such other section of the Company Disclosure Letter is reasonably apparent
on the face of such disclosure;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such disclosure shall be deemed to qualify the last sentence of
_Section 4E_ unless expressly set forth in  _Section 4E_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter. The inclusion of information in the Company Disclosure
Letter shall not be construed as, and shall not constitute, an admission or
agreement that a violation, right of termination, default, liability or other
obligation of any kind exists with respect to any item, nor shall it be
construed as or constitute an admission or agreement that such information is
material to Seller or the Company. In addition, matters reflected in the
Company Disclosure Letter are not necessarily limited to matters required by
this Agreement to be reflected in the Company Disclosure Letter. Such
additional matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not
necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. Neither the
specifications of any dollar amount in any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific
item in the Company Disclosure Letter is intended to imply that such amount,
or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or
are not material, and no Person shall use the fact of the setting forth of
any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or
controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described herein or included in the Company Disclosure Letter is or is
not material for purposes of this Agreement. Further, neither the
specification of any item or matter in any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item
in the Company Disclosure Letter is intended to imply that such item or
matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of
business, and no Person shall use the fact of setting forth or the inclusion
of any such items or matter in any dispute or controversy between the Parties
as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included
in the Company Disclosure Letter is or is not in the ordinary course of
business for purposes of this Agreement.

   

(ii) From time to time prior to the Closing, Seller shall be entitled to
supplement, amend or modify the Company Disclosure Schedule to reflect (a)
factors, circumstances or events first arising or, in the case of
representations given to Sellers Knowledge, becoming first known to Seller
between the date hereof and the Closing or (b) any other supplement,
amendment or modification consented to by Buyer in writing prior thereto
(each, a " _Schedule Supplement_ ") by providing Buyer with written notice
specifying the schedule or schedules to be updated thereby. Each such
Schedule Supplement shall be deemed to supplement, amend and modify the
Schedules; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Schedule Supplement shall not
affect any Buyers rights (or any of Sellers obligations) with respect to
indemnification hereunder or the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Article 7_ , including the consequences of any failure of any such conditions
to be satisfied, unless Buyer expressly consents to such Schedule Supplement
in connection with a consent or approval required pursuant to _Section 6B_ ,
in which case such Schedule Supplement to the extent describing such item
shall be deemed to supplement, amend and modify the Schedules for
all purposes of this Agreement.

 

10N. _No Additional Representations; Disclaimer_.

 

(i) Buyer, on behalf of itself and all Buyer Parties, acknowledges and agrees
that neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives, nor any
other Person acting on behalf of Seller nor any of its Affiliates or
Representatives, has made any representation or warranty, express or implied,
as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding Seller or the
Company or their respective businesses, operations or assets, except as
expressly set forth in  _Article 3_ or _Article 4_ (as modified by the
Company Disclosure Letter), respectively. Buyer further agrees that,
except as expressly set forth in _Article 3_ or _Article 4_ (as modified by
the Company Disclosure Letter), neither Seller nor any of its direct or
indirect Affiliates or Representatives (or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, members, stockholders, managers, partners, agents or
otherwise), will have or be subject to any liability to Buyer or any other
Person resulting from any information, document or material made available
to, or used by, Buyer or its Affiliates or their respective Representatives,
including information, documents or materials, provided in certain "data
rooms" and online "data sites," management presentations, management
interviews, or any other form in expectation or anticipation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(ii) THE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THOSE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN _ARTICLES 3_ AND _4_
) ARE THE RESULT OF EXTENSIVE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN BUYER AND SELLER AND NO
OTHER ASSURANCES, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE QUALITY, CONDITION
OR STATE OF THE COMPANY OR ITS ASSETS WERE MADE BY SELLER IN THE INDUCEMENT
THEREOF, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED HEREIN.

    

(iii) In connection with Buyers investigation of the Company, Buyer has
received, directly or indirectly, through its Affiliates or Representatives,
from or on behalf of Seller or its Affiliates or Representatives, certain
projections, including projected statements of operating revenues, income
from operations and cash flows of the Company (and the business transactions
and events underlying such statements) and certain business plan information,
projections, presentations, predictions, calculations, estimates and
forecasts of the Company and other similar data. Buyer, on behalf of itself
and all Buyer Parties, acknowledges and agrees that there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans,
statements, predictions, presentations, calculations and other similar data,
that Buyer is well aware of such uncertainties, that Buyer is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections, forecasts, plans, statements, calculations,
presentations, predictions and other similar data so furnished to it
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts, plans, statements, calculations, predictions and
other similar data), and that neither Buyer, nor any Buyer Party, shall have
any Claim under any circumstances against Seller or any other Person with
respect thereto or arising therefrom, except as expressly set forth in
_Article 3_ or _Article 4_ (as modified by the Company Disclosure Letter).
Accordingly, except as expressly set forth in _Article 3_ or _Article 4_ (as
modified by the Company Disclosure Letter), Seller makes no representations
or warranties whatsoever to Buyer or any other Person, and expressly
disclaims all liability and responsibility, in each case with respect to such
estimates, projections, forecasts, plans, statements,
calculations, presentations, predictions and other similar data (including
the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such projections, forecasts,
plans, statements, calculations, presentations, predictions and other similar
data) or with respect to (a) the performance or success of the Company at any
time after the date hereof, and no such Person shall be entitled to rely on
such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans, statements, calculations,
presentations, predictions and other similar data for any purpose, including
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b)
the possibility or likelihood of the occurrence of any environmental
condition, release or hazard, or any mechanical or technical issue, problem,
or failure, or of any interruption in service, or of any increase, decrease
or plateau in the volume of product or service, or revenue derived therefrom,
or of the possibility, likelihood or potential outcome of any complaints,
controversies or disputes with respect to existing or future customers or
suppliers, in each case, related to the Company or its assets.

 

10O. _Payments under Agreement_. Each Party agrees that all amounts required
to be paid hereunder shall be paid in United States currency and, except
as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, without discount, rebate
or reduction and subject to no counterclaim or offset (other than withholding
Tax obligations required to be withheld by Law), on the dates specified
herein (with time being of the essence).

 

10P. _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any covenant or agreement of this Agreement is
not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached
or threatened to be breached and that an award of money damages would be
inadequate in such event. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that the Parties
and the third party beneficiaries of this Agreement shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief,
without proof of actual damages, including an injunction or injunctions or
orders for specific performance to prevent breaches of the covenants and
agreements of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the covenants and
agreements of this Agreement (including any order sought by a Party to cause
the other Party to perform its agreements and covenants contained in this
Agreement). Each Party further agrees that the right of specific performance
and other equitable relief is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, none of the Parties
would have entered into this Agreement. The Parties agree not to assert that
a remedy of specific performance or other equitable relief is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert
that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that
the Parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at Law. If, on or prior to the
Outside Date, any Party brings any action to enforce specifically the
performance of the covenants and agreements hereof by any other Party, the
Outside Date shall automatically be extended (x) for the period during which
such action is pending, plus ten (10) Business Days or (y) by such other time
period established by the court presiding over such action, as the case may
be.

   

10Q. _No Partnership Created_. Nothing in this Agreement (including  _Section
6A_ and _Section 6B_ ) is intended to give Buyer, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the Companys operations prior to the Closing and,
without limiting its obligations under this Agreement, the Company shall
exercise complete control over its operations. Furthermore, in no event shall
this Agreement be deemed to create a partnership between Seller or any of its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates, on the other hand,
and in no event shall any fiduciary or similar duty be deemed owed by Seller
or any of its Affiliates to Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

 

10R. _Non-Recourse_. All claims, obligations, liabilities or causes of action
(whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity or granted by statute)
that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be
connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including
any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an
inducement to, this Agreement) and the transactions contemplated hereby, may
be made only against (and such representations and warranties are those
solely of) the Persons that are expressly identified as parties or otherwise
having obligations with respect to this Agreement in the preamble to this
Agreement (the " _Contracting Parties_ "). No Person who is not
a Contracting Party, including any past, present or future incorporator,
member, partner, stockholder, equityholder, Affiliate, Representative or
assignee of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any Contracting Party,
or any past, present or future incorporator, member, partner, stockholder,
equityholder, Affiliate, Representative or assignee of, and any financial
advisor or lender to, any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Nonparty
Affiliates_ "), shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in
law or in equity, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action,
obligations or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or
related in any manner to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or breach of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and, to the maximum
extent permitted by Law, each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases
all such liabilities, claims, causes of action and obligations against any
such Nonparty Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum
extent permitted by Law, except to the extent otherwise set forth in either
Confidentiality Agreement, each Contracting Party disclaims any reliance upon
any Nonparty Affiliates with respect to the performance of this Agreement or
any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an
inducement to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer Guarantor
and the Seller Guarantor are Contracting Parties and not Nonparty Affiliates
and shall therefore be liable under the terms of the Buyer Guaranty or Seller
Guaranty, as applicable, in accordance with its terms.

construction, modification, ownership and operation of the Adelphia Pipeline
Project; (ii) construct and modify, as applicable, the Adelphia Pipeline

4\. Open Season, Customers FTS Agreement and Notice of In-Service Date. 

 

(a) Adelphia intends to conduct an Open Season for the Adelphia
Pipeline Project, generally in accordance with the following procedures:

 

(i) The Open Season is projected to last at least twenty (20) days, and will
offer other parties an opportunity to acquire capacity on the Adelphia
Pipeline Project incremental to the capacity required to serve the Legacy
Shipper, and prorations of the MDQs of Foundation Shippers and Anchor
Shippers that have executed precedent agreements prior to the commencement of
the Open Season shall be limited as set forth below.

 

(ii) The Open Season Notice will state that bidders will be deemed Foundation
Shippers by submitting a conforming bid during the Open Season agreeing to a
minimum initial MDQ of 100,000 Dth/d for a minimum initial term of fifteen
(15) years for service on Zone North A and/or Zone South. Foundation
Shippers MDQs on the Adelphia Pipeline Project will not be subject to
proration to accommodate other bids received during the Open Season, unless
proration is necessary to accommodate the capacity contracted for by
the Legacy Shipper or bids of other Foundation Shippers or otherwise required
by an order issued by the FERC.

 

(iii) The Open Season Notice will state that bidders will be deemed Anchor
Shippers by submitting a conforming bid during the Open Season agreeing to a
minimum initial MDQ of 75,000 Dth/d for a minimum initial term of ten (10)
years for service on Zone North A and/or Zone South. Anchor Shippers MDQs on
the Adelphia Pipeline Project will not be subject to proration to accommodate
other bids received during the Open Season unless proration is necessary to
accommodate the capacity contracted for by the Legacy Shipper or the bids of
Foundation Shippers or other Anchor Shippers or otherwise required by an
order issued by the FERC.

 

(iv) Adelphia shall not be otherwise restricted by the terms of this
Precedent Agreement from constructing a larger or smaller project than
contemplated herein, provided that, with the exception of potential prorating
consistent with the foregoing limitations, Customers rights under this
Precedent Agreement shall not be adversely affected by any such
project modifications nor shall any such project modifications have an
adverse effect on the In-Service Date.

 

(b) The Parties agree that execution and delivery of this Precedent Agreement
by both Parties shall constitute Customers binding request for service under
the Open Season consistent with the terms and conditions of this Precedent
Agreement.

 

(c) The MDQ, the primary term, the Primary Receipt Points and
Primary Delivery Points, and rates to apply under Customers FTS Agreement,
as requested by Customer and agreed to by Adelphia, are set forth on Exhibit
A and Exhibit C to this Precedent Agreement. Adelphia shall incorporate the
service parameters specified in Exhibit A and Exhibit C into Customers FTS
Agreement. 

 

(d) After receipt and acceptance by Adelphia of the Certificate,
Adelphia shall provide Customer with an unexecuted copy of Customers FTS
Agreement, which Adelphia shall prepare substantially in the form set forth
in Exhibit B and incorporating any changes required by FERC. Within ten (10)
Business Days after Customers receipt of same, Customer shall execute and
deliver Customers FTS Agreement to Adelphia, immediately following which
Adelphia shall execute such FTS Agreement and provide Customer with a fully
executed FTS Agreement, which agreement shall be binding and effective but
whose terms shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver of any remaining
conditions precedent set forth herein and the completion of and commencement
of service on the Adelphia Pipeline Project.

   

(e) Customer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Adelphia may file Customers
FTS Agreement and/or information pertaining to such FTS Agreement with FERC
for purposes of obtaining FERC acceptance of that agreement as a Negotiated
Rate agreement and/or nonconforming agreement if Adelphia determines that
such filing is necessary or advisable under FERCs regulations.
Adelphia shall provide a draft copy of such filing to Customer prior to
submitting such filing to FERC. Customer shall have the right, consistent
with the provisions of Section 3(b), to intervene and protest or otherwise
participate in the FERC proceeding established to review such filing and take
positions intended to preserve the benefits of Customers FTS Agreement,
including the agreed upon rate, term, MDQ, receipt and delivery point rights,
surcharges and other terms and conditions set forth in this Precedent
Agreement. In the event FERC issues an order declining to accept Customers
FTS Agreement or accepting Customers FTS Agreement subject to conditions or
modifications that have a material adverse impact on Customer, as determined
by Customer acting in good faith in a commercially reasonable manner, the
Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to modify Customers FTS Agreement
in order to preserve the material terms of this Precedent Agreement, and to
conform with the FERC order addressing Customers FTS Agreement; provided,
however, Customer shall be permitted to terminate this Precedent Agreement
and the related FTS Agreement without liability to Adelphia (including
without liability for Reimbursable Costs incurred by Adelphia) if the Parties
cannot agree to terms and conditions necessary to (i) preserve the material
terms of this Precedent Agreement and (ii) conform with FERCs order. 

 

(f) The Firm Transportation Service obligation and Customers obligation to
pay for such Firm Transportation Service under Customers FTS Agreement
shall not become effective until Adelphia has achieved the In-Service Date
and has furnished a Final Notice to Customer in accordance with Section
4(g). 

 

(g) Not less than fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the anticipated In-
Service Date, Adelphia shall notify Customer of the anticipated In-
Service Date. If, after Adelphia has provided the notice described in the
immediately preceding sentence, Adelphia concludes that it will not be able
to commence service by the anticipated In-Service Date, then Adelphia shall
provide to Customer written notice specifying the new anticipated In-Service
Date. Adelphia shall provide Customer with at least seven (7) calendar days
advance written notice ("Final Notice") of the actual scheduled In-Service
Date.

 

5\. Rates.

 

(a) Customer, having been apprised of the availability of the
maximum Recourse Rate for the services described herein, elects and agrees,
for the term of the Customers FTS Agreement, to pay the Negotiated Rate for
the Firm Transportation Service to be provided by Adelphia under Customers
FTS Agreement as indicated on Exhibit C, which rate shall be incorporated
into Customers FTS Agreement.

   

(b) It is expressly understood that the Negotiated Rate for
Firm Transportation Service indicated on Exhibit C is derived from the
Recourse Rate for Firm Transportation Service under the Tariff as proposed by
Adelphia, which Recourse Rate is derived, in large part, based upon an
estimated cost of the Adelphia Pipeline Project. To the extent that there is
an increase in such revised Recourse Rate from the initial Recourse Rate that
had been derived from the original cost estimate for the Adelphia Pipeline
Project, the Negotiated Rate shall not be adjusted.

 

6\. Obligation to Provide Customer Opportunity to Review
Certificate Application

 

Adelphia will furnish Customer with a draft copy of the
Certificate Application text and the public exhibits, including the pro forma
Tariff, but not including the environmental resource reports or any non-
public or critical energy infrastructure information exhibits no less than
ten (10) Business Days prior to the date Adelphia intends to file such
Certificate Application. Customer will provide Adelphia in writing no more
than five (5) days after the date of receipt of such draft Certificate
Application with any requested material revisions or comments that it may
have with respect thereto. Adelphia shall use reasonable efforts to consider
Customers requests and, in its sole judgment, may revise such draft
Certificate Application to address the Customers requests. Within two (2)
Business Days after the date of filing, Adelphia shall provide Customer with
a copy of the Certificate Application marked to show all changes from the
draft previously provided to Customer.

 

7\. Conditions Precedent.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Precedent Agreement to
the contrary, Adelphias obligations under this Precedent Agreement to
undertake the acquisition and construction activities associated with the
Adelphia Pipeline Project, to execute the FTS Agreement, and to provide Firm
Transportation Service to Customer are expressly conditioned on the
satisfaction or waiver of the following:

 

(i) Customer meets the Creditworthiness Requirements contained in Section 11
as of the Effective Date and continuing throughout the term of this Precedent
Agreement and the FTS Agreement; 

 

(ii) Adelphia shall have received and accepted the Certificate; and

 

(iii) The Closing shall have occurred.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Precedent Agreement to
the contrary, the performance by Customer of its obligations under this
Precedent Agreement to execute the FTS Agreement, and to take Firm
Transportation Service on the Adelphia Pipeline Project, are expressly
conditioned on the satisfaction or waiver of the following:

 

(i) Adelphia shall have received and accepted the Certificate; and

 

(ii) The Closing shall have occurred.

   

8\. Termination Rights.

 

(a) If the condition precedent specified in Section 7(a)(i) is not satisfied,
and Adelphia does not waive the condition or extend the time
for satisfaction, then Adelphia will have the right to terminate this
Precedent Agreement, and the FTS Agreement if executed, effective upon
written notice to Customer.

 

(b) If the Purchase and Sale Agreement is terminated, this
Precedent Agreement shall automatically terminate. Termination pursuant to
this Section 8(b) shall be without any liability to Adelphia or Customer
under this Agreement, including any obligation by Customer to pay
Reimbursable Costs pursuant to Section 9.

 

(c) If this Precedent Agreement automatically terminates pursuant to Section
8(b) or either Party terminates this Precedent Agreement for any
reason permitted hereunder (including a termination by Customer under Section
4(e)) except if Adelphia terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10,
Adelphia shall return to Customer within five (5) Business Days of the date
of such termination any Security provided by Customer pursuant to Section
11. 

 

(d) Any termination right described in this Section 8 that is not exercised
by the date specified for such exercise or, if no date is specified, then
within a reasonable time after the non-satisfaction of the
applicable condition precedent (not to exceed sixty (60) days) shall be
deemed waived. Any termination right that arises after Customers FTS
Agreement has been executed, but prior to the In-Service Date, shall be
deemed to include the right to terminate Customers FTS Agreement as well.

 

(e) Remedies in the Event of Early Termination.

 

(i) In the event of any termination of this Precedent Agreement in accordance
with the termination provisions of this Section 8, each Party shall be
discharged from any obligations or liabilities that have not accrued as of
the date of such termination for damages, costs, or expenses of the other
Party or of such other Partys shareholders, directors, officers, employees,
agents, successors, assignees, members, or consultants related to this
Precedent Agreement and/or the Customers FTS Agreement, and, except for
those obligations that expressly survive pursuant to Section 2(b), the
Parties thereafter shall have no further rights or obligations
whatsoever under this Precedent Agreement and/or Customers FTS Agreement.

 

(ii) In the event of any termination of this Precedent Agreement pursuant to
Section 10, the non-defaulting Party shall be entitled to all rights and
remedies, at law or in equity, as set forth in Section 10. In addition, if
Adelphia is the non-defaulting Party, Customer shall be responsible for
Reimbursable Costs in accordance with Section 9.

 

9\. Customer Reimbursement Obligation for Certain Early Terminations. 

 

(a) The Parties acknowledge that in order for Adelphia to develop
the Adelphia Pipeline Project by the Target In-Service Date, Adelphia must
make expenditures and incur internal and external ("third-party") costs
relating to long lead-time materials, engineering consultants, environmental
consultants, and other costs and expenses related to the development of the
Adelphia Pipeline Project, the filing and pursuit of the Certificate
Application and Other Governmental Authorizations, and the construction and
modification of the Adelphia Pipeline Project facilities.

   

(b) "Reimbursable Costs" shall include those documented costs and expenses
reasonably incurred or accrued by Adelphia from and after the Effective Date
and reasonably allocable to Zone North A and Zone North B, including
costs incurred with respect to acquisition of the existing portions of the
Adelphia Pipeline Project, engineering and design services, mobilization
and demobilization of contractors, surveying, preparation of
regulatory, environmental and other applications or permits, legal,
environmental, and consulting services, company and contract labor, right of
way, easement and real property right acquisition, and material and equipment
costs (including costs incurred for long lead-time items) net of salvage
value as determined by Adelphia in a commercially reasonable manner, carrying
costs (including any allowance for funds used during construction accrued as
of the date of termination), costs associated with remediation of
construction and modification activities, and costs associated with
decommissioning, removal and abandonment of facilities. Adelphia shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the Reimbursable Costs to be
reimbursed by Customer under this Precedent Agreement.

 

(c) In consideration of Adelphias agreement to incur Reimbursable Costs, if
this Precedent Agreement is terminated by Adelphia pursuant to Section
10, then Customer agrees to pay in full its proportionate share (as
determined by comparing Customers MDQ to the Initial Zone North Capacity) of
all Reimbursable Costs that are duly itemized and presented. Adelphia shall
invoice Customer for the same within sixty (60) days of such termination,
and, subject to Section 9(d) below, such invoice shall be payable by Customer
to Adelphia not later than sixty (60) days from the date of Customers
receipt of Adelphias invoice. 

 

(d) Within the sixty (60) day period after Customers receipt of Adelphias
invoice for Reimbursable Costs and prior to its due date, Customer shall have
the right, at its own expense, upon notice to Adelphia and at reasonable
times, to examine and audit and to obtain copies of the relevant portion of
the books and records of Adelphia only to the extent reasonably necessary to
verify the accuracy of the invoiced Reimbursement Costs. 

 

(e) If the Customer, in good faith, disputes the invoiced amount or any part
thereof, Customer will pay such amount as it concedes to be
correct; provided, however, if the Customer disputes the amount due, it must
provide supporting documentation to support the amount disputed without undue
delay and any amount later determined to be owed to Adelphia shall be paid in
full plus interest equal to the rate calculated by FERC in accordance with
Section 154.501(d) of the FERCs regulations. In the event the Parties are
unable to resolve such dispute, either Party may pursue any remedy available
at law or in equity to enforce its rights.

   

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs, if after a termination
by Adelphia by reason of a Default by Customer under Section 10(a) triggering
the obligation of Customer to pay Reimbursable Costs, as described
above, Adelphia continues its acquisition and development
and construction/modifications of the Adelphia Pipeline Project or the
Adelphia Pipeline Project is placed in service (either before or after such
termination), Adelphia shall, subject to the terms of Adelphias Tariff and
applicable FERC orders, rules and regulations, make a commercially reasonable
efforts to subscribe the firm transportation capacity under the Adelphia
Pipeline Project that was intended for Customer hereunder on the same terms
as set forth in this Precedent Agreement; provided, any previously
unsubscribed capacity shall be fully subscribed before Adelphia is required
pursuant to this Section 9(f) to re-subscribe Customers capacity made
available by the termination of this agreement due to Default by Customer..
If Adelphia is able to subscribe with other shipper(s) all or a portion of
such capacity on the same terms as set forth in this Precedent Agreement (or
on terms more favorable to Adelphia) within twelve (12) months of the In-
Service Date, then the determination of Customers proportionate share of
Reimbursable Costs under Section 9(c) above shall be modified by subtracting
from Customers MDQ the transportation contract quantity subscribed by
Adelphia in accordance with the foregoing. If Adelphia is able to subscribe
with other shipper(s) all or a portion of the capacity intended for Customer
under the Adelphia Pipeline Project but on terms less favorable to Adelphia
as set forth in this Precedent Agreement within twelve (12) months of the In-
Service Date, then the determination of Customers proportionate share of
Reimbursable Costs under Section 9(c) above shall be reduced by such amount
as reasonably determined by Adelphia in a commercially reasonable manner,
taking into consideration the reasonable value to Adelphia of such capacity
subscription(s), and Adelphia shall provide reasonable, written support to
Customer for such determination. If Adelphia is unable to subscribe with
other shipper(s) any of such capacity within twelve (12) months of the In-
Service Date, then Customer shall remain responsible for its
proportionate share of the Reimbursable Costs in accordance with Section
9(c). Notwithstanding, Customer shall not be liable and have no obligation
of Reimbursable Costs for any other Legacy Shipper, Foundation Shipper,
Anchor Shipper or other shippers (collectively, "Third-Party Shippers")
reimbursable costs as a result of a Third-Party Shippers termination of its
precedent agreement with Adelphia or otherwise withdrawal from the Adelphia
Pipeline Project. Further, if this Precedent Agreement is in effect and
Customer is not in breach of any provision under this Precedent Agreement,
then Customer shall not be liable and have no obligation of Reimbursable
Costs if a Third-Party Shippers termination or otherwise withdrawal from the
Adelphia Pipeline Project results in the dissolution of the Adelphia Pipeline
Project or otherwise causes failure of completion of the Adelphia Pipeline
Project.

 

(g) The terms of this Section 9, and all associated sections necessary
to interpret and apply Customers reimbursement obligation as specified
herein, shall survive termination of this Precedent Agreement.

 

10\. Default.

 

(a) The occurrence of any of the following events shall constitute
a "Default" hereunder (with any Default by any Guarantor to be deemed to be
a Default by Customer hereunder):

 

(i) Customer fails to make any payment or provide any Security at the time
required under this Precedent Agreement or Guarantor fails to make any
payment at the time required under the Guaranty, and such failure is not
remedied within five (5) Business Days after written notice thereof from
Adelphia; or

 

(ii) Either Party willfully fails to timely satisfy a condition precedent
under Section 7 that is reasonably within its control and then in bad faith
terminates this Precedent Agreement so as to achieve an economic advantage.

   

(iii) Adelphia or Customer fails to perform any other material obligation
under this Precedent Agreement or breaches any other material term or
condition of this Precedent Agreement (other than as provided in Section
10(a)(iv)) and such failure or breach is not remedied within ten
(10) Business Days after written notice thereof from the other Party; or

 

(iv) Adelphia, Customer or, if applicable, any Guarantor becomes Bankrupt
and, in the case of a Guarantor, the Customer does not provide Substitute
Security in accordance with Section 11 within five (5) Business Days of
Guarantor becoming Bankrupt; or

 

(v) Any representation or warranty made by Adelphia or Customer under this
Precedent Agreement, or by any Guarantor under any guaranty delivered
pursuant to Section 11(b)(i), is inaccurate or untrue in any material respect
when made or when deemed repeated and the same is not cured within ten (10)
Business Days of written notice thereof from the other Party. 

 

(b) In the event of a Default hereunder, the non-defaulting Party shall have,
in addition to all other rights and remedies under this Precedent Agreement
and Customers FTS Agreement, if executed, or otherwise available at law or
in equity, (i) the right to immediately suspend performance under
this Precedent Agreement, and (ii) the right to terminate this Precedent
Agreement and, if executed, Customers FTS Agreement, upon five (5) days
written notice thereof to the defaulting Party.

 

(c) In the event of a Default hereunder, the non-defaulting Party may, in its
sole discretion, exercise any one or more of the rights and remedies provided
in this Precedent Agreement or otherwise available at law or in
equity, including:

 

(i) the right to terminate this Precedent Agreement and, if executed,
Customers FTS Agreement, in accordance with Section 10 and to seek monetary
damages or equitable relief for the non-performance of this Precedent
Agreement; provided that, with respect to Adelphia, such monetary damages
shall be limited to the Reimbursable Costs it is entitled to pursuant
to Section 9 hereof;

 

(ii) with respect to Adelphia, all rights and remedies available to a secured
party pursuant to Section 9-314 of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and
other applicable laws with respect to Security held by or for the benefit of
Adelphia;

 

(iii) with respect to Adelphia, the right to set off any Security held by or
for the benefit of Adelphia against and in satisfaction of any amount payable
by Customer in respect of any of its obligations under this Precedent
Agreement; and/or;

 

(iv) with respect to Adelphia, the right to demand payment under any Security
provided by Customer to Adelphia pursuant to Section 11.

 

The non-defaulting Party shall be under no obligation to prioritize the order
with respect to which it exercises any one or more rights and remedies
available hereunder. No failure on the part of non-defaulting Party to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right or remedy shall operate as a
waiver thereof. A waiver by the non-defaulting Party of any right or remedy
on any occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which
the non-defaulting Party would otherwise have on any other occasion. Except
as expressly provided herein, each and every right and remedy granted to the
non-defaulting Party hereunder or allowed it by law or other agreement shall
be cumulative and not exclusive of any other remedy. Adelphias recourse with
respect to a Default by Customer is not limited to Security provided
hereunder or to any other collateral or proceeds thereof, and the defaulting
Party shall in all events remain liable to the non-defaulting Party for any
amount payable in respect of any of its obligations that remain unpaid after
the application of any such Security. The satisfaction by Customer of the
Creditworthiness Requirements described herein shall in no way affect
Adelphias right to seek damages or other remedies under this Agreement.

   

11\. Creditworthiness Requirements. Customer must satisfy the
requirements specified in this Section 11 (the "Creditworthiness
Requirements") at all times during the Security Period.

 

(a) Customer shall, at any time during the Security Period, be deemed
to satisfy the Creditworthiness Requirements if, at such time, Customer: 

 

(i) maintains an Investment Grade Credit Rating; or

 

(ii) does not have an Investment Grade Credit Rating but (A) the then-
applicable Security Amount is less than twenty-five percent (25%) of
Customers tangible total net worth and (B) Adelphia otherwise determines
Customer to be creditworthy on the basis of Adelphias review of Customers
financial information and its non-discriminatory application of objective
credit evaluation criteria.

 

(b) If at any time during the Security Period for any reason Customer ceases
to satisfy the Creditworthiness Requirements of Section 11(a) because it no
longer meets the criteria in 11(a)(i) or 11(a)(ii)(A) and/or otherwise
has had a material adverse change in its financial status (each a
"Downgrade Event"), then Adelphia shall notify Customer of its failure to
satisfy such requirements and the reason for such failure and within five (5)
Business Days Customer may notify Adelphia of any changes to Customers
status that should have the effect of correcting such failure. If Adelphia
determines that Customer nonetheless continues to fail to satisfy the
requirements in Section 11(a), then Adelphia shall provide written
notification to Customer of the Downgrade Event and Customer shall satisfy
these Creditworthiness Requirements by delivering to Adelphia, within five
(5) Business Days after receiving written notice from Adelphia of the
occurrence of the Downgrade Event, any of the following ("Security"), as
selected by Customer in its sole discretion, as additional security for its
obligations under this Precedent Agreement and Customers FTS Agreement:

 

(i) an irrevocable, transferable unconditional guaranty of payment of all
obligations of Customer under this Precedent Agreement and Customers FTS
Agreement for the full Security Period, provided, however, that such amount
shall not exceed an amount equal to three (3) years of reservation charges,
or if less than three (3) years remains under the term of the FTS Agreement,
then such amount shall not exceed an amount equal to the reservation charges
applicable to the remaining term, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Adelphia, issued in favor of Adelphia by either (a) an unaffiliated Person
that has and maintains during the Security Period an Investment Grade Credit
Rating, or (b) a direct or indirect parent company of Customer (each, a
"Guarantor"), provided that in the case of a Guarantor in clause (b), the
Guarantor either (i) has and maintains during the Security Period an
Investment Grade Credit Rating or (ii) does not have an Investment Grade
Rating but (x) the then-applicable Security Amount is less than twenty-five
percent (25%) of the Guarantors tangible total net worth and (y) Adelphia
otherwise determines the Guarantor to be creditworthy on the basis of
Adelphias review of the Guarantors financial information and its non-
discriminatory application of objective credit evaluation criteria; or 

   

(ii) one or more Letters of Credit in a total amount not less than the
Security Amount issued for the benefit of Adelphia, in form and substance,
including drawing conditions, reasonably acceptable to Adelphia; or

 

(iii) cash in an amount not less than the Security Amount to be held by a
Qualified Institution in escrow on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable
to Adelphia.

 

(c) Customer may, at any time, substitute one form of Security ("Substitute
Security") for the then-outstanding Security ("Original Security"), and
Adelphia shall return to Customer the Original Security within two
(2) Business Days of its receipt of the Substitute Security. Customer shall
grant to Adelphia a present and continuing security interest in and to, and a
general first lien upon and right of set off against, any and all Security or
Substitute Security which has been or may in the future be transferred to, or
received by, Adelphia and/or a Qualified Institution (in the case of cash
deposited pursuant to Section 11(b)(iii)), and all dividends, interest, and
other proceeds from time to time received, receivable or otherwise
distributed in respect of, or in exchange for, any or all of the foregoing,
and Customer shall take such action as Adelphia reasonably requests in order
to perfect Adelphias continuing security interest in, and lien on (and right
of setoff against), such Security. 

 

(d) At any time, should Adelphia have a commercially reasonable reason
to question Customers ability to meet the Creditworthiness Requirements in
this Section 11, Adelphia shall have the right to require that Customer
demonstrate its continuing satisfaction of the Creditworthiness Requirements
pursuant to this Section 11, including that any Security or Substitute
Security provided to Adelphia pursuant hereto continues to satisfy the
requirements for Security required by Section 11(b). Customer shall have a
period of five (5) Business Days to make such demonstration or to furnish
Security or Substitute Security, as applicable, to Adelphia in accordance
with this Section 11.

 

(e) As used herein, the term "Security Amount" means the amount reasonably
determined by Adelphia which represents the portion of
Customers proportionate share (as determined by comparing Customers MDQ to
the anticipated initial firm capacity of the Adelphia Pipeline Project as of
the In-Service Date) of Adelphias costs incurred in obtaining a FERC
Certificate and Other Governmental Authorizations, acquiring the existing
portions of the Adelphia Pipeline Project, and constructing and modifying the
Adelphia Pipeline Project as it relates to the portion of Adelphias costs
expended to date in relation to the total costs estimated to be expended by
Adelphia for the Adelphia Pipeline Project, as such costs increase over the
period of acquisition and construction up to Customers proportionate share
of the entire cost of the Adelphia Pipeline Project (for purposes of clarity,
Customers Security Amount shall be ramped up incrementally as often as
monthly, as described in Section 11(f) below, in the same increment that
Adelphias incurred costs for the Project has increased during the applicable
period as such increase relates to Adelphias overall cost estimate for the
Projecte.g., if Adelphia has expended 1/8th of its total budget, then the
Security Amount shall be based on 1/8th of Customers proportionate share of
such costs); provided that at no time shall the Security Amount exceed
Customers proportionate share (as determined by comparing Customers MDQ to
the anticipated initial firm capacity of the Adelphia Pipeline Project as of
the In-Service Date) of the then-estimated cost of the Adelphia Pipeline
Project, for the period prior to the In-Service Date, and of the depreciated
original cost of the Adelphia Pipeline Project, for the period commencing on
and following the In-Service Date; provided further that in no event shall
the Security Amount exceed an amount equal to three (3) years of reservation
charges, or if less than three (3) years remains under the term of the FTS
Agreement, then such amount shall not exceed an amount equal to
the reservation charges applicable to the remaining term.

   

(f) Adelphia may adjust the Security Amount required from Assignee Shipper
based on changes in the Security Amount, as determined in Section
11(e), provided that such changes shall not be made more frequently than once
every one (1) months. If Adelphia requires Assignee Shipper to post
additional Security at any time based on such changes in the Security Amount,
it will provide written Notice to Assignee Shipper at least five (5) Business
Days prior to when such additional Security is required, including in such
notice reasonable details on the calculation of such additional Security, and
Assignee Shipper shall post such additional Security within ten (10) days of
receiving such written Notice. 

 

(g) All costs incurred by Customer in providing any required Security
or Substitute Security shall be borne by Customer. If Customer elects to
provide Security or Substitute Security in the form of a Letter of Credit,
Customer shall renew or cause the renewal of each outstanding Letter of
Credit on a timely basis as provided in the relevant Letter of Credit. If the
Qualified Institution that issued an outstanding Letter of Credit has
indicated its intent not to renew such Letter of Credit, Customer shall
provide Substitute Security for the benefit of Adelphia in accordance with
Section 11(c) at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the expiration of
the outstanding Letter of Credit. If a Qualified Institution issuing a Letter
of Credit shall fail to honor Adelphias properly documented request to draw
on such Letter of Credit, Customer shall, as soon as practical and in no
event later than five (5) Business Days after such refusal, provide
Substitute Security for the benefit of Adelphia in accordance with Section
11(c).

 

(h) Upon or at any time after the occurrence and continuation of a Default by
Customer or Guarantor (which shall include Customers failure to timely
provide or replace Security or Substitute Security hereunder), and without
limiting Customers obligations to Adelphia or Adelphias rights and remedies
hereunder, Adelphia may draw on the entire, undrawn portion of
any outstanding guaranty, Letter of Credit, or cash collateral by submitting
to the entity issuing such guaranty, the Qualified Institution issuing such
Letter of Credit or the Qualified Institution at which such cash collateral
is maintained, as applicable, one or more certificates specifying that such
Default has occurred and is continuing. Cash proceeds received from drawing
upon a guaranty, Letter of Credit or cash collateral shall be deemed security
for Customers obligations to Adelphia and Adelphia shall have rights and
remedies set forth in Section 11(c) with respect to such cash proceeds. 

   

(i) Within five (5) Business Days after termination of the Security Period,
Adelphia shall return to Customer the amount of any Security then remaining
in Adelphias possession.

 

(j) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Precedent Agreement or of
Customers FTS Agreement, Section 11 of this Precedent Agreement is
hereby incorporated into and made a part of Customers FTS Agreement, shall
survive the termination of this Precedent Agreement and Customers FTS
Agreement as provided above, and shall continue in effect until the Security
Amount is no greater than the amount of credit support that would be required
of Customer under Adelphias approved Tariff. Thereafter, Customer will be
required to comply with the creditworthiness provisions of Adelphias
approved Tariff. The creditworthiness tariff provisions that Adelphia will
propose as part of its Certificate Application will be substantially similar
to those proposed in this Section 11. 

 

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Precedent
Agreement, Adelphia acknowledges and agrees that it has assessed
Customers creditworthiness and recognizing the interrelated nature of the
commitments provided between the Parties under this Precedent Agreement,
between Adelphia and Customers Affiliate Martins Creek under the Martins
Creek Precedent Agreement and between Adelphia and Customers Affiliate
Talen Generation, LLC under the Purchase and Sale Agreement, during the
Security Period, Customer will be deemed to have satisfied the
Creditworthiness Requirements in Section 11(a)(ii)(B), so long as (i)
Customers Affiliate Talen Generation, LLC (or any successor-in-interest or
permitted assignee of Talen Generation, LLC to the Purchase and Sale
Agreement) continues to fully meet its obligations to Adelphia pursuant to
Section 6V ( _Seller s Letter of Credit Obligations_) in the Purchase
and Sale Agreement to deliver and maintain a "Letter of Credit" (as defined
in the Purchase and Sale Agreement, and further, hereinafter such "Letter of
Credit" shall be referred to in this Precedent Agreement as the "PSA Letter
of Credit") and/or cash collateral in the amount required thereunder, and
(ii) such PSA Letter of Credit entitles Adelphia to draw on the PSA Letter of
Credit, and any such cash collateral is available to be withdrawn and
applied, upon or at any time after the occurrence and continuation of a
Default by Customer under this Precedent Agreement or Customers FTS
Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, Adelphia and Customer agree that such PSA
Letter of Credit shall satisfy the definition of an acceptable Letter of
Credit under this Precedent Agreement and shall, together with any cash
collateral delivered pursuant to Section 6V of the Purchase and Sale
Agreement, constitute Security under this Precedent Agreement. So long as
such PSA Letter of Credit and/or cash collateral is maintained and Customer
remains an Affiliate of Talen Generation, LLC (or any successor-in-interest
or permitted assignee of Talen Generation, LLC to the Purchase and Sale
Agreement), neither Adelphia nor Customer shall have the right to request an
adjustment in the Security Amount hereunder and Adelphia shall not have the
right to request additional Security from Customer in any other form. In the
event that (A) Customer assigns this Precedent Agreement and/or the
FTS Agreement to a permitted assignee pursuant to Section 12(b) that is not
an Affiliate of Talen Generation, LLC (or any successor-in-interest or
permitted assignee of Talen Generation, LLC to the Purchase and Sale
Agreement) or (B) Customer is no longer an Affiliate Customer (hereinafter
referred to as a "Non-Affiliate Customer"), and the creditworthiness of such
Non-Affiliate Customer at the time of the transfer/assignment to such Non-
Affiliate Customer or such time an Affiliate Customer became a Non-Affiliate
Customer or any time thereafter is materially weaker than that of the
Affiliate Customer immediately preceding such transfer/assignment or change
in affiliation (as determined by Adelphia), then such Non-Affiliate Customer
shall deliver to Adelphia and maintain additional Security in the amount
equal to one-third (1/3) of the difference between (x) the "Letter of Credit
Amount" (as defined in the Purchase and Sale Agreement), as of the time of
such transfer/assignment or change in affiliation, without any adjustment for
previously drawn Letter of Credit amounts, and (y) the amount of the PSA
Letter of Credit and/or cash collateral required under Section 6V of the
Purchase and Sale Agreement as of the time of such transfer/assignment or
change in affiliation. Any conflict in the terms of this Section 11(k) and
the terms of the remainder of this Section 11 shall be resolved in favor of
this Section 11(k).

   

12\. Assignment.

 

(a) Except as provided below, Adelphia may not assign its rights
and obligations under this Precedent Agreement without the prior written
consent of Customer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned,
or delayed, provided, however, that Adelphia may assign this Precedent
Agreement to any affiliated entity which may succeed Adelphia by purchase,
merger, joint venture, or consolidation, and any such successor in interest
shall have all of the rights and obligations of Adelphia hereunder.
Furthermore, Adelphia may, as security for its indebtedness, assign, mortgage
or pledge any of its rights or obligations under this Precedent Agreement,
including its rights to receive payments, to any other entity, without the
prior written consent of Customer, and Customer will execute any consent
agreement with such entity and provide such certificates and other documents
as Adelphia may reasonably request in connection with any such assignment,
mortgage or pledge; provided that such consent agreement is on commercially
reasonable terms and shall not contain any provisions that are materially
inconsistent with, or would require a waiver of, Customers rights under this
Precedent Agreement.

 

(b) Customer may not assign its rights and obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of Adelphia, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that
Customer may assign this Precedent Agreement without such consent to any
affiliated entity, or any entity that succeeding to all or substantially all
of Customers assets, in each case that satisfies the Creditworthiness
Requirements hereunder. Furthermore, Customer may, as security for its
indebtedness, assign, mortgage or pledge any of its rights or obligations
under this Precedent Agreement to any other entity, without the prior consent
of Adelphia, and Adelphia shall execute any consent agreement with such
entity and provide such certificates and other documents as Customer may
reasonably request in connection with any such assignment, mortgage or
pledge; provided that such consent agreement is on commercially
reasonable terms and shall not contain any provisions that are materially
inconsistent with, or would require a waiver of, Adelphias rights under this
Precedent Agreement. 

 

13\. Successors and Assigns. This Precedent Agreement shall inure to
the benefit of and be binding upon each of the Parties and their
permitted successors and assigns.

 

14\. Governing Law; Limitations on Damages. THIS PRECEDENT AGREEMENT SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE LAWS
THAT MIGHT BE APPLICABLE UNDER CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES. NOTWITHSTANDING
ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS PRECEDENT AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY
SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES. WITH RESPECT TO ANY AND ALL
DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PRECEDENT AGREEMENT,
INCLUDING DISPUTES CONCERNING ITS FORMATION, VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION,
EXECUTION, TERMINATION OR BREACH. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY (A) SUBMITS TO THE
JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN
DISTRICT OF NEW YORK LOCATED IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN, NEW YORK CITY,
U.S.A., OR, IF SUCH COURT DECLINES TO EXERCISE OR DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION,
IN ANY NEW YORK STATE COURT IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN; (B) AGREES AND
CONSENTS TO SERVICE OF PROCESS BY CERTIFIED MAIL, DELIVERED TO THE PARTY AT

Shippers by submitting a conforming bid during the Open Season agreeing to a
minimum initial MDQ of 100,000 Dth/d for a minimum initial term of fifteen
(15) years for service on Zone North A and/or Zone South. Foundation
Shippers MDQs on the Adelphia Pipeline Project will not be subject to

proration is necessary to accommodate the capacity contracted for by
the Legacy Shipper or bids of other Foundation Shippers or otherwise required
by an order issued by the FERC.

 

(iii) The Open Season Notice will state that bidders will be deemed Anchor
Shippers by submitting a conforming bid during the Open Season agreeing to a
minimum initial MDQ of 75,000 Dth/d for a minimum initial term of ten (10)
years for service on Zone North A and/or Zone South. Anchor Shippers MDQs on

Foundation Shippers or other Anchor Shippers or otherwise required by an
order issued by the FERC.

Precedent Agreement from constructing a larger or smaller project than

project modifications nor shall any such project modifications have an
adverse effect on the In-Service Date.

 

(b) The Parties agree that execution and delivery of this Precedent Agreement
by both Parties shall constitute Customers binding request for service under
the Open Season consistent with the terms and conditions of this Precedent
Agreement.

 

(c) The MDQ, the primary term, the Primary Receipt Points and
Primary Delivery Points, and rates to apply under Customers FTS Agreement,

(d) After receipt and acceptance by Adelphia of the Certificate,
Adelphia shall provide Customer with an unexecuted copy of Customers FTS
Agreement, which Adelphia shall prepare substantially in the form set forth
in Exhibit B and incorporating any changes required by FERC. Within ten (10)
Business Days after Customers receipt of same, Customer shall execute and
deliver Customers FTS Agreement to Adelphia, immediately following which
Adelphia shall execute such FTS Agreement and provide Customer with a fully
executed FTS Agreement, which agreement shall be binding and effective but
whose terms shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver of any remaining
conditions precedent set forth herein and the completion of and commencement
of service on the Adelphia Pipeline Project.

   

(e) Customer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Adelphia may file Customers
FTS Agreement and/or information pertaining to such FTS Agreement with FERC
for purposes of obtaining FERC acceptance of that agreement as a Negotiated
Rate agreement and/or nonconforming agreement if Adelphia determines that
such filing is necessary or advisable under FERCs regulations.
Adelphia shall provide a draft copy of such filing to Customer prior to
submitting such filing to FERC. Customer shall have the right, consistent
with the provisions of Section 3(b), to intervene and protest or otherwise
participate in the FERC proceeding established to review such filing and take
positions intended to preserve the benefits of Customers FTS Agreement,
including the agreed upon rate, term, MDQ, receipt and delivery point rights,
surcharges and other terms and conditions set forth in this Precedent
Agreement. In the event FERC issues an order declining to accept Customers
FTS Agreement or accepting Customers FTS Agreement subject to conditions or
modifications that have a material adverse impact on Customer, as determined
by Customer acting in good faith in a commercially reasonable manner, the
Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to modify Customers FTS Agreement
in order to preserve the material terms of this Precedent Agreement, and to
conform with the FERC order addressing Customers FTS Agreement; provided,
however, Customer shall be permitted to terminate this Precedent Agreement
and the related FTS Agreement without liability to Adelphia (including
without liability for Reimbursable Costs incurred by Adelphia) if the Parties
cannot agree to terms and conditions necessary to (i) preserve the material
terms of this Precedent Agreement and (ii) conform with FERCs order.

pay for such Firm Transportation Service under Customers FTS Agreement
shall not become effective until Adelphia has achieved the In-Service Date
and has furnished a Final Notice to Customer in accordance with Section
4(g). 

 

(g) Not less than fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the anticipated In-
Service Date, Adelphia shall notify Customer of the anticipated In-
Service Date. If, after Adelphia has provided the notice described in the
immediately preceding sentence, Adelphia concludes that it will not be able
to commence service by the anticipated In-Service Date, then Adelphia shall
provide to Customer written notice specifying the new anticipated In-Service
Date. Adelphia shall provide Customer with at least seven (7) calendar days
advance written notice ("Final Notice") of the actual scheduled In-Service
Date.

maximum Recourse Rate for the services described herein, elects and agrees,

FTS Agreement as indicated on Exhibit C, which rate shall be incorporated
into Customers FTS Agreement.

   

(b) It is expressly understood that the Negotiated Rate for
Firm Transportation Service indicated on Exhibit C is derived from the
Recourse Rate for Firm Transportation Service under the Tariff as proposed by
Adelphia, which Recourse Rate is derived, in large part, based upon an
estimated cost of the Adelphia Pipeline Project. To the extent that there is
an increase in such revised Recourse Rate from the initial Recourse Rate that
had been derived from the original cost estimate for the Adelphia Pipeline
Project, the Negotiated Rate shall not be adjusted.

regulatory, environmental and other applications or permits, legal,
environmental, and consulting services, company and contract labor, right of
way, easement and real property right acquisition, and material and equipment
costs (including costs incurred for long lead-time items) net of salvage
value as determined by Adelphia in a commercially reasonable manner, carrying
costs (including any allowance for funds used during construction accrued as
of the date of termination), costs associated with remediation of
construction and modification activities, and costs associated with
decommissioning, removal and abandonment of facilities. Adelphia shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the Reimbursable Costs to be
reimbursed by Customer under this Precedent Agreement.

 

(c) In consideration of Adelphias agreement to incur Reimbursable Costs, if
this Precedent Agreement is terminated by Adelphia pursuant to Section
10, then Customer agrees to pay in full its proportionate share (as
determined by comparing Customers MDQ to the Initial Zone North Capacity) of
all Reimbursable Costs that are duly itemized and presented. Adelphia shall
invoice Customer for the same within sixty (60) days of such termination,
and, subject to Section 9(d) below, such invoice shall be payable by Customer
to Adelphia not later than sixty (60) days from the date of Customers
receipt of Adelphias invoice. 

 

(d) Within the sixty (60) day period after Customers receipt of Adelphias
invoice for Reimbursable Costs and prior to its due date, Customer shall have
the right, at its own expense, upon notice to Adelphia and at reasonable
times, to examine and audit and to obtain copies of the relevant portion of
the books and records of Adelphia only to the extent reasonably necessary to
verify the accuracy of the invoiced Reimbursement Costs. 

 

(e) If the Customer, in good faith, disputes the invoiced amount or any part
thereof, Customer will pay such amount as it concedes to be
correct; provided, however, if the Customer disputes the amount due, it must
provide supporting documentation to support the amount disputed without undue
delay and any amount later determined to be owed to Adelphia shall be paid in
full plus interest equal to the rate calculated by FERC in accordance with
Section 154.501(d) of the FERCs regulations. In the event the Parties are
unable to resolve such dispute, either Party may pursue any remedy available
at law or in equity to enforce its rights.

   

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs, if after a termination
by Adelphia by reason of a Default by Customer under Section 10(a) triggering
the obligation of Customer to pay Reimbursable Costs, as described
above, Adelphia continues its acquisition and development
and construction/modifications of the Adelphia Pipeline Project or the
Adelphia Pipeline Project is placed in service (either before or after such
termination), Adelphia shall, subject to the terms of Adelphias Tariff and
applicable FERC orders, rules and regulations, make a commercially reasonable
efforts to subscribe the firm transportation capacity under the Adelphia
Pipeline Project that was intended for Customer hereunder on the same terms
as set forth in this Precedent Agreement; provided, any previously
unsubscribed capacity shall be fully subscribed before Adelphia is required
pursuant to this Section 9(f) to re-subscribe Customers capacity made
available by the termination of this agreement due to Default by Customer..
If Adelphia is able to subscribe with other shipper(s) all or a portion of
such capacity on the same terms as set forth in this Precedent Agreement (or
on terms more favorable to Adelphia) within twelve (12) months of the In-
Service Date, then the determination of Customers proportionate share of
Reimbursable Costs under Section 9(c) above shall be modified by subtracting
from Customers MDQ the transportation contract quantity subscribed by
Adelphia in accordance with the foregoing. If Adelphia is able to subscribe
with other shipper(s) all or a portion of the capacity intended for Customer
under the Adelphia Pipeline Project but on terms less favorable to Adelphia
as set forth in this Precedent Agreement within twelve (12) months of the In-
Service Date, then the determination of Customers proportionate share of
Reimbursable Costs under Section 9(c) above shall be reduced by such amount
as reasonably determined by Adelphia in a commercially reasonable manner,
taking into consideration the reasonable value to Adelphia of such capacity
subscription(s), and Adelphia shall provide reasonable, written support to
Customer for such determination. If Adelphia is unable to subscribe with
other shipper(s) any of such capacity within twelve (12) months of the In-
Service Date, then Customer shall remain responsible for its
proportionate share of the Reimbursable Costs in accordance with Section
9(c). Notwithstanding, Customer shall not be liable and have no obligation
of Reimbursable Costs for any other Legacy Shipper, Foundation Shipper,
Anchor Shipper or other shippers (collectively, "Third-Party Shippers")
reimbursable costs as a result of a Third-Party Shippers termination of its
precedent agreement with Adelphia or otherwise withdrawal from the Adelphia
Pipeline Project. Further, if this Precedent Agreement is in effect and
Customer is not in breach of any provision under this Precedent Agreement,
then Customer shall not be liable and have no obligation of Reimbursable
Costs if a Third-Party Shippers termination or otherwise withdrawal from the
Adelphia Pipeline Project results in the dissolution of the Adelphia Pipeline
Project or otherwise causes failure of completion of the Adelphia Pipeline
Project.

 

(g) The terms of this Section 9, and all associated sections necessary
to interpret and apply Customers reimbursement obligation as specified
herein, shall survive termination of this Precedent Agreement.

 

10\. Default.

 

(a) The occurrence of any of the following events shall constitute
a "Default" hereunder (with any Default by any Guarantor to be deemed to be
a Default by Customer hereunder):

 

(i) Customer fails to make any payment or provide any Security at the time
required under this Precedent Agreement or Guarantor fails to make any
payment at the time required under the Guaranty, and such failure is not
remedied within five (5) Business Days after written notice thereof from
Adelphia; or

 

(ii) Either Party willfully fails to timely satisfy a condition precedent
under Section 7 that is reasonably within its control and then in bad faith
terminates this Precedent Agreement so as to achieve an economic advantage.

   

(iii) Adelphia or Customer fails to perform any other material obligation
under this Precedent Agreement or breaches any other material term or
condition of this Precedent Agreement (other than as provided in Section
10(a)(iv)) and such failure or breach is not remedied within ten
(10) Business Days after written notice thereof from the other Party; or

 

(iv) Adelphia, Customer or, if applicable, any Guarantor becomes Bankrupt
and, in the case of a Guarantor, the Customer does not provide Substitute
Security in accordance with Section 11 within five (5) Business Days of
Guarantor becoming Bankrupt; or

 

(v) Any representation or warranty made by Adelphia or Customer under this
Precedent Agreement, or by any Guarantor under any guaranty delivered
pursuant to Section 11(b)(i), is inaccurate or untrue in any material respect
when made or when deemed repeated and the same is not cured within ten (10)
Business Days of written notice thereof from the other Party. 

 

(b) In the event of a Default hereunder, the non-defaulting Party shall have,
in addition to all other rights and remedies under this Precedent Agreement
and Customers FTS Agreement, if executed, or otherwise available at law or
in equity, (i) the right to immediately suspend performance under
this Precedent Agreement, and (ii) the right to terminate this Precedent
Agreement and, if executed, Customers FTS Agreement, upon five (5) days
written notice thereof to the defaulting Party.

 

(c) In the event of a Default hereunder, the non-defaulting Party may, in its
sole discretion, exercise any one or more of the rights and remedies provided
in this Precedent Agreement or otherwise available at law or in
equity, including:

 

(i) the right to terminate this Precedent Agreement and, if executed,
Customers FTS Agreement, in accordance with Section 10 and to seek monetary
damages or equitable relief for the non-performance of this Precedent
Agreement; provided that, with respect to Adelphia, such monetary damages
shall be limited to the Reimbursable Costs it is entitled to pursuant
to Section 9 hereof;

 

(ii) with respect to Adelphia, all rights and remedies available to a secured
party pursuant to Section 9-314 of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and
other applicable laws with respect to Security held by or for the benefit of
Adelphia;

 

(iii) with respect to Adelphia, the right to set off any Security held by or
for the benefit of Adelphia against and in satisfaction of any amount payable
by Customer in respect of any of its obligations under this Precedent
Agreement; and/or;

 

(iv) with respect to Adelphia, the right to demand payment under any Security
provided by Customer to Adelphia pursuant to Section 11.

 

The non-defaulting Party shall be under no obligation to prioritize the order
with respect to which it exercises any one or more rights and remedies
available hereunder. No failure on the part of non-defaulting Party to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right or remedy shall operate as a
waiver thereof. A waiver by the non-defaulting Party of any right or remedy
on any occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which
the non-defaulting Party would otherwise have on any other occasion. Except
as expressly provided herein, each and every right and remedy granted to the
non-defaulting Party hereunder or allowed it by law or other agreement shall
be cumulative and not exclusive of any other remedy. Adelphias recourse with
respect to a Default by Customer is not limited to Security provided
hereunder or to any other collateral or proceeds thereof, and the defaulting
Party shall in all events remain liable to the non-defaulting Party for any
amount payable in respect of any of its obligations that remain unpaid after
the application of any such Security. The satisfaction by Customer of the
Creditworthiness Requirements described herein shall in no way affect
Adelphias right to seek damages or other remedies under this Agreement.

   

11\. Creditworthiness Requirements. Customer must satisfy the
requirements specified in this Section 11 (the "Creditworthiness
Requirements") at all times during the Security Period.

 

(a) Customer shall, at any time during the Security Period, be deemed
to satisfy the Creditworthiness Requirements if, at such time, Customer: 

 

(i) maintains an Investment Grade Credit Rating; or

 

(ii) does not have an Investment Grade Credit Rating but (A) the then-
applicable Security Amount is less than twenty-five percent (25%) of
Customers tangible total net worth and (B) Adelphia otherwise determines
Customer to be creditworthy on the basis of Adelphias review of Customers
financial information and its non-discriminatory application of objective
credit evaluation criteria.

 

(b) If at any time during the Security Period for any reason Customer ceases
to satisfy the Creditworthiness Requirements of Section 11(a) because it no
longer meets the criteria in 11(a)(i) or 11(a)(ii)(A) and/or otherwise
has had a material adverse change in its financial status (each a
"Downgrade Event"), then Adelphia shall notify Customer of its failure to
satisfy such requirements and the reason for such failure and within five (5)
Business Days Customer may notify Adelphia of any changes to Customers
status that should have the effect of correcting such failure. If Adelphia
determines that Customer nonetheless continues to fail to satisfy the
requirements in Section 11(a), then Adelphia shall provide written
notification to Customer of the Downgrade Event and Customer shall satisfy
these Creditworthiness Requirements by delivering to Adelphia, within five
(5) Business Days after receiving written notice from Adelphia of the
occurrence of the Downgrade Event, any of the following ("Security"), as
selected by Customer in its sole discretion, as additional security for its
obligations under this Precedent Agreement and Customers FTS Agreement:

 

(i) an irrevocable, transferable unconditional guaranty of payment of all
obligations of Customer under this Precedent Agreement and Customers FTS
Agreement for the full Security Period, provided, however, that such amount
shall not exceed an amount equal to three (3) years of reservation charges,
or if less than three (3) years remains under the term of the FTS Agreement,
then such amount shall not exceed an amount equal to the reservation charges
applicable to the remaining term, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Adelphia, issued in favor of Adelphia by either (a) an unaffiliated Person
that has and maintains during the Security Period an Investment Grade Credit
Rating, or (b) a direct or indirect parent company of Customer (each, a
"Guarantor"), provided that in the case of a Guarantor in clause (b), the
Guarantor either (i) has and maintains during the Security Period an
Investment Grade Credit Rating or (ii) does not have an Investment Grade
Rating but (x) the then-applicable Security Amount is less than twenty-five
percent (25%) of the Guarantors tangible total net worth and (y) Adelphia
otherwise determines the Guarantor to be creditworthy on the basis of
Adelphias review of the Guarantors financial information and its non-
discriminatory application of objective credit evaluation criteria; or 

   

(ii) one or more Letters of Credit in a total amount not less than the
Security Amount issued for the benefit of Adelphia, in form and substance,
including drawing conditions, reasonably acceptable to Adelphia; or

 

(iii) cash in an amount not less than the Security Amount to be held by a
Qualified Institution in escrow on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable
to Adelphia.

 

(c) Customer may, at any time, substitute one form of Security ("Substitute
Security") for the then-outstanding Security ("Original Security"), and
Adelphia shall return to Customer the Original Security within two
(2) Business Days of its receipt of the Substitute Security. Customer shall
grant to Adelphia a present and continuing security interest in and to, and a
general first lien upon and right of set off against, any and all Security or
Substitute Security which has been or may in the future be transferred to, or
received by, Adelphia and/or a Qualified Institution (in the case of cash
deposited pursuant to Section 11(b)(iii)), and all dividends, interest, and
other proceeds from time to time received, receivable or otherwise
distributed in respect of, or in exchange for, any or all of the foregoing,
and Customer shall take such action as Adelphia reasonably requests in order
to perfect Adelphias continuing security interest in, and lien on (and right
of setoff against), such Security. 

 

(d) At any time, should Adelphia have a commercially reasonable reason
to question Customers ability to meet the Creditworthiness Requirements in
this Section 11, Adelphia shall have the right to require that Customer
demonstrate its continuing satisfaction of the Creditworthiness Requirements
pursuant to this Section 11, including that any Security or Substitute
Security provided to Adelphia pursuant hereto continues to satisfy the
requirements for Security required by Section 11(b). Customer shall have a
period of five (5) Business Days to make such demonstration or to furnish
Security or Substitute Security, as applicable, to Adelphia in accordance
with this Section 11.

 

(e) As used herein, the term "Security Amount" means the amount reasonably
determined by Adelphia which represents the portion of
Customers proportionate share (as determined by comparing Customers MDQ to
the anticipated initial firm capacity of the Adelphia Pipeline Project as of
the In-Service Date) of Adelphias costs incurred in obtaining a FERC
Certificate and Other Governmental Authorizations, acquiring the existing
portions of the Adelphia Pipeline Project, and constructing and modifying the
Adelphia Pipeline Project as it relates to the portion of Adelphias costs
expended to date in relation to the total costs estimated to be expended by
Adelphia for the Adelphia Pipeline Project, as such costs increase over the
period of acquisition and construction up to Customers proportionate share
of the entire cost of the Adelphia Pipeline Project (for purposes of clarity,
Customers Security Amount shall be ramped up incrementally as often as
monthly, as described in Section 11(f) below, in the same increment that
Adelphias incurred costs for the Project has increased during the applicable
period as such increase relates to Adelphias overall cost estimate for the
Projecte.g., if Adelphia has expended 1/8th of its total budget, then the
Security Amount shall be based on 1/8th of Customers proportionate share of
such costs); provided that at no time shall the Security Amount exceed
Customers proportionate share (as determined by comparing Customers MDQ to
the anticipated initial firm capacity of the Adelphia Pipeline Project as of
the In-Service Date) of the then-estimated cost of the Adelphia Pipeline
Project, for the period prior to the In-Service Date, and of the depreciated
original cost of the Adelphia Pipeline Project, for the period commencing on
and following the In-Service Date; provided further that in no event shall
the Security Amount exceed an amount equal to three (3) years of reservation
charges, or if less than three (3) years remains under the term of the FTS
Agreement, then such amount shall not exceed an amount equal to
the reservation charges applicable to the remaining term.

   

(f) Adelphia may adjust the Security Amount required from Assignee Shipper
based on changes in the Security Amount, as determined in Section
11(e), provided that such changes shall not be made more frequently than once
every one (1) months. If Adelphia requires Assignee Shipper to post
additional Security at any time based on such changes in the Security Amount,
it will provide written Notice to Assignee Shipper at least five (5) Business
Days prior to when such additional Security is required, including in such
notice reasonable details on the calculation of such additional Security, and
Assignee Shipper shall post such additional Security within ten (10) days of
receiving such written Notice. 

 

(g) All costs incurred by Customer in providing any required Security
or Substitute Security shall be borne by Customer. If Customer elects to
provide Security or Substitute Security in the form of a Letter of Credit,
Customer shall renew or cause the renewal of each outstanding Letter of
Credit on a timely basis as provided in the relevant Letter of Credit. If the
Qualified Institution that issued an outstanding Letter of Credit has
indicated its intent not to renew such Letter of Credit, Customer shall
provide Substitute Security for the benefit of Adelphia in accordance with
Section 11(c) at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the expiration of
the outstanding Letter of Credit. If a Qualified Institution issuing a Letter
of Credit shall fail to honor Adelphias properly documented request to draw
on such Letter of Credit, Customer shall, as soon as practical and in no
event later than five (5) Business Days after such refusal, provide
Substitute Security for the benefit of Adelphia in accordance with Section
11(c).

 

(h) Upon or at any time after the occurrence and continuation of a Default by
Customer or Guarantor (which shall include Customers failure to timely
provide or replace Security or Substitute Security hereunder), and without
limiting Customers obligations to Adelphia or Adelphias rights and remedies
hereunder, Adelphia may draw on the entire, undrawn portion of
any outstanding guaranty, Letter of Credit, or cash collateral by submitting
to the entity issuing such guaranty, the Qualified Institution issuing such
Letter of Credit or the Qualified Institution at which such cash collateral
is maintained, as applicable, one or more certificates specifying that such
Default has occurred and is continuing. Cash proceeds received from drawing
upon a guaranty, Letter of Credit or cash collateral shall be deemed security
for Customers obligations to Adelphia and Adelphia shall have rights and
remedies set forth in Section 11(c) with respect to such cash proceeds. 

   

(i) Within five (5) Business Days after termination of the Security Period,
Adelphia shall return to Customer the amount of any Security then remaining
in Adelphias possession.

 

(j) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Precedent Agreement or of
Customers FTS Agreement, Section 11 of this Precedent Agreement is
hereby incorporated into and made a part of Customers FTS Agreement, shall
survive the termination of this Precedent Agreement and Customers FTS
Agreement as provided above, and shall continue in effect until the Security
Amount is no greater than the amount of credit support that would be required
of Customer under Adelphias approved Tariff. Thereafter, Customer will be
required to comply with the creditworthiness provisions of Adelphias
approved Tariff. The creditworthiness tariff provisions that Adelphia will
propose as part of its Certificate Application will be substantially similar
to those proposed in this Section 11. 

 

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Precedent
Agreement, Adelphia acknowledges and agrees that it has assessed
Customers creditworthiness and recognizing the interrelated nature of the
commitments provided between the Parties under this Precedent Agreement,
between Adelphia and Customers Affiliate Lower Mount Bethel under the Lower
Mount Bethel Precedent Agreement and between Adelphia and Customers
Affiliate Talen Generation, LLC under the Purchase and Sale Agreement, during
the Security Period, Customer will be deemed to have satisfied the
Creditworthiness Requirements in Section 11(a)(ii)(B), so long as (i)
Customers Affiliate Talen Generation, LLC (or any successor-in-interest or
permitted assignee of Talen Generation, LLC to the Purchase and Sale
Agreement) continues to fully meet its obligations to Adelphia pursuant to
Section 6V ( _Seller s Letter of Credit Obligations_) in the Purchase
and Sale Agreement to deliver and maintain a "Letter of Credit" (as defined
in the Purchase and Sale Agreement, and further, hereinafter such "Letter of
Credit" shall be referred to in this Precedent Agreement as the "PSA Letter
of Credit") and/or cash collateral in the amount required thereunder, and
(ii) such PSA Letter of Credit entitles Adelphia to draw on the PSA Letter of
Credit, and any such cash collateral is available to be withdrawn and
applied, upon or at any time after the occurrence and continuation of a
Default by Customer under this Precedent Agreement or Customers FTS
Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, Adelphia and Customer agree that such PSA
Letter of Credit shall satisfy the definition of an acceptable Letter of
Credit under this Precedent Agreement and shall, together with any cash
collateral delivered pursuant to Section 6V of the Purchase and Sale
Agreement, constitute Security under this Precedent Agreement. So long as
such PSA Letter of Credit and/or cash collateral is maintained and Customer
remains an Affiliate of Talen Generation, LLC (or any successor-in-interest
or permitted assignee of Talen Generation, LLC to the Purchase and Sale
Agreement), neither Adelphia nor Customer shall have the right to request an
adjustment in the Security Amount hereunder and Adelphia shall not have the
right to request additional Security from Customer in any other form. In the
event that (A) Customer assigns this Precedent Agreement and/or the
FTS Agreement to a permitted assignee pursuant to Section 12(b) that is not
an Affiliate of Talen Generation, LLC (or any successor-in-interest or
permitted assignee of Talen Generation, LLC to the Purchase and Sale
Agreement) or (B) Customer is no longer an Affiliate Customer (hereinafter
referred to as a "Non-Affiliate Customer"), and the creditworthiness of such
Non-Affiliate Customer at the time of the transfer/assignment to such Non-
Affiliate Customer or such time an Affiliate Customer became a Non-Affiliate
Customer or any time thereafter is materially weaker than that of the
Affiliate Customer immediately preceding such transfer/assignment or change
in affiliation (as determined by Adelphia), then such Non-Affiliate Customer
shall deliver to Adelphia and maintain additional Security in the amount
equal to two-thirds (2/3) of the difference between (x) the "Letter of Credit
Amount" (as defined in the Purchase and Sale Agreement), as of the time of
such transfer/assignment or change in affiliation, without any adjustment for
previously drawn Letter of Credit amounts, and (y) the amount of the PSA
Letter of Credit and/or cash collateral required under Section 6V of the
Purchase and Sale Agreement as of the time of such transfer/assignment or
change in affiliation. Any conflict in the terms of this Section 11(k) and
the terms of the remainder of this Section 11 shall be resolved in favor of
this Section 11(k).

   

12\. Assignment.

 

(a) Except as provided below, Adelphia may not assign its rights
and obligations under this Precedent Agreement without the prior written
consent of Customer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned,
or delayed, provided, however, that Adelphia may assign this Precedent
Agreement to any affiliated entity which may succeed Adelphia by purchase,
merger, joint venture, or consolidation, and any such successor in interest
shall have all of the rights and obligations of Adelphia hereunder.
Furthermore, Adelphia may, as security for its indebtedness, assign, mortgage
or pledge any of its rights or obligations under this Precedent Agreement,
including its rights to receive payments, to any other entity, without the
prior written consent of Customer, and Customer will execute any consent
agreement with such entity and provide such certificates and other documents
as Adelphia may reasonably request in connection with any such assignment,
mortgage or pledge; provided that such consent agreement is on commercially
reasonable terms and shall not contain any provisions that are materially
inconsistent with, or would require a waiver of, Customers rights under this
Precedent Agreement.

 

(b) Customer may not assign its rights and obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of Adelphia, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that
Customer may assign this Precedent Agreement without such consent to any
affiliated entity, or any entity that succeeding to all or substantially all
of Customers assets, in each case that satisfies the Creditworthiness
Requirements hereunder. Furthermore, Customer may, as security for its
indebtedness, assign, mortgage or pledge any of its rights or obligations
under this Precedent Agreement to any other entity, without the prior consent
of Adelphia, and Adelphia shall execute any consent agreement with such
entity and provide such certificates and other documents as Customer may
reasonably request in connection with any such assignment, mortgage or
pledge; provided that such consent agreement is on commercially
reasonable terms and shall not contain any provisions that are materially
inconsistent with, or would require a waiver of, Adelphias rights under this
Precedent Agreement. 

 

13\. Successors and Assigns. This Precedent Agreement shall inure to
the benefit of and be binding upon each of the Parties and their
permitted successors and assigns.

Agreement, dated October 27, 2017 (the " _Agreement_ "), pursuant to which
Buyer has agreed to purchase from Seller one hundred percent (100%) of the

liability company (the " _Transaction_ "); 

 

WHEREAS, in connection with the Transaction, Guarantor has agreed to provide

(100%) of the membership interests in Buyer;

 

WHEREAS, Guarantor expects to derive financial benefits from the Transaction;

 

WHEREAS, it is and will be in the interest and financial benefit of Guarantor
to induce the parties to enter into and consummate the transactions

WHEREAS, this Guaranty has been executed concurrently with the execution of

NOW, THEREFORE, for value received and in consideration of mutual agreements
and covenants concurrently herewith being afforded or hereafter to be
afforded to the Guarantor, the undersigned hereby agrees as follows:

 

AGREEMENTS 

 

1\. _Guaranty_. Subject to the provisions hereof, Guarantor hereby
irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally guarantees, upon written demand,
the full and prompt payment when due of all debts, obligations and
liabilities at any time owing by Buyer to Seller or remaining unpaid by Buyer
to Seller incurred under, or arising out of, the Agreement (all such debts,
obligations and liabilities are collectively referred to as the "
_Obligations_ "). To the extent that Buyer fails to pay any of the
Obligations, Guarantor shall, subject to the provisions hereof, pay or cause
to be paid such Obligations to the extent of such failed payment. This
Guaranty shall constitute a guarantee of payment, not of collection. The
liability and performance of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be subject
to the following terms and conditions of this Guaranty, including Section 7 (
_Limitation_ ) hereof. 

   

2\. _Guarantor s Obligations Unconditional_. No renewal, compromise,
extension, acceleration, amendment, waiver, or modification of or addition or
supplement to or deletion from any of the terms of the Agreement or other
change in the terms of the Obligations, or any part thereof, shall release or
limit Guarantors liability hereunder, and every such change is hereby
in every respect consented to by Guarantor.

 

3\. _Payment Demand_. Seller shall make a demand (a " _Payment Demand_ ")
upon Guarantor if at any time Buyer fails to pay any of its Obligations under
the Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof. A Payment Demand shall be
in writing and shall reasonably and briefly specify the Obligation(s) that
Buyer has failed to pay in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and
that Seller is calling upon Guarantor to pay. A Payment Demand in the
foregoing form shall be deemed sufficient notice to Guarantor that it must
pay or cause to be paid the Obligation(s).

 

4\. _Setoffs and Counterclaims_. Without limiting Guarantors own defenses
and rights hereunder, Guarantor reserves to itself all rights,
setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses which Buyer is or may be entitled
to arising from or out of the Agreement, the nature of Sellers claim or
otherwise, except for defenses arising out of the bankruptcy, insolvency,
dissolution or liquidation of Buyer, or any other defense expressly waived
hereunder. If any payment of the Obligations is rescinded or must be
otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of Buyer or a similar proceeding or circumstance, then
Guarantors obligations hereunder with respect to such payment or payments
shall be reinstated as though such payment had not been made.

 

5\. _Representations and Warranties_. Guarantor represents and warrants
that: 

 

(i) it is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of New Jersey and it has the requisite corporate
power and authority to own its assets and carry on its business as now being
conducted;

 

(ii) it has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver
and perform its obligations under this Guaranty, and the execution, delivery
and performance by it of this Guaranty have been duly authorized by all
requisite corporate action on its part;

 

(iii) such execution, delivery and performance do not violate or conflict
with any law applicable to it, any provision of its constitutional documents,
any order or judgment of any court or other agency of government applicable
to it or any of its assets or any contractual restriction binding on or
affecting it or any of its assets; 

 

(iv) no authorization, approval, consent or order of, or registration or
filing with, any court or other governmental body having jurisdiction over
Guarantor is required on the part of Guarantor for the execution, delivery
and performance by Guarantor of this Guaranty which has not been obtained and
in full force and effect; 

 

(v) this Guaranty, when executed and delivered, constitutes its legal, valid
and binding obligation enforceable against it in accordance with its terms,
except as the same may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
laws affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of
equity;

   

(vi) there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge
of the Guarantor, threatened against or affecting the Guarantor before any
court, governmental agency or arbitrator, which may, in any one case or in
the aggregate, materially adversely affect the financial condition,
operations, properties or business of the Guarantor or of the ability of the
Guarantor to perform its obligations under the Guaranty; and

 

(vii) the individual signing below is authorized to bind the Guarantor to its
obligations under this Guaranty.

7\. _Limitation_. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Guaranty or
of the Agreement, Guarantors maximum aggregate liability to Seller and
Sellers right of recovery under this Guaranty for the entire term hereof
shall be equal to the sum of (i) the Base Purchase Price specified in the
Agreement, _plus_ (ii) the Contingent Payment specified in the Agreement, if
any,  _plus_ , (iii) any other Obligations of Buyer under the Agreement, if
any, _plus_ (iv) reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable
external attorneys fees) to enforce this Guaranty, but only to the extent
(a) demand is made and not honored in a timely manner and (b) payment under
this Guaranty is otherwise due. Such reasonable out-of-pocket expenses shall
be payable only if Seller prevails in its claim against
Guarantor. Furthermore, in no event shall Guarantor be liable for
consequential, exemplary, special, lost profits, punitive, tort, indirect,
incidental or any other similar damages except in each case to the extent
that they constitute Obligations that are required to be paid under the
Agreement.

   

8\. _Amendment of Guaranty_. No term or provision of this Guaranty shall
be amended, modified, altered, waived, supplemented or terminated except by
a written instrument executed by the Guarantor and the Seller.

 

9\. _Waivers_. Guarantor hereby waives (i) notice of acceptance of this
Guaranty; (ii) diligence, presentment, demand, notice of dishonor, protest,
notice of any sale of collateral security and all other notices whatsoever
except as expressly herein set forth; and (iii) any right to require that any
action or proceeding be brought against Buyer or any other person, or any
right to require that Seller seek enforcement of any performance against
Buyer or any other person, prior to any action against Guarantor under the
terms hereof. Except as to applicable statutes of limitation, no delay of
Seller in the exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights hereunder shall
operate as a waiver of such rights, a waiver of any other rights or a release
of Guarantor from any obligations hereunder.

 

10\. _Subrogation_. Guarantor hereby agrees not to assert or enforce any right
of contribution, reimbursement, indemnity, subrogation or any other right
to payment from the Buyer as a result of Guarantors performance of its
obligations pursuant to this Guaranty until all Obligations are irrevocably
paid in full. Any amount paid to the Guarantor in violation of the preceding
sentence shall be held by the Guarantor for the benefit of the Seller and
shall forthwith be paid to the Seller to be credited and applied to the
Obligations.

 

11\. _Assignment_. This Guaranty shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by Guarantor and Seller and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Except as provided below, neither party may
assign any of its rights or obligations under this Guaranty without the other
partys prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, and any such purported assignment without such written consent
shall be void. Seller may, upon notice to Guarantor, assign its rights
hereunder to any permitted assignee of the Agreement.

 

12\. _Severability_. If any provision of this Guaranty is determined to be
invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, the remainder of this Guaranty
and any other application of such provision shall not be affected thereby.

 

13\. _Headings_. The headings in this Guaranty are for purposes of reference
only, and shall not affect the meaning hereof.

 

14\. _GOVERNING LAW._ THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND ENFORCED PURSUANT TO THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
JERSEY, EXCLUDING ANY CONFLICT-OF-LAW RULES WHICH WOULD DIRECT THE
APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION. ANY FINAL JUDGMENT (AFTER
APPEAL OR EXPIRATION OF TIME FOR APPEAL) ENTERED BY SUCH COURT SHALL BE
CONCLUSIVE AND BINDING UPON THE PARTIES AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN THE COURTS OF
ANY OTHER JURISDICTION TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

   

15\. _Termination_. This Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect from
and after the date hereof until the date on which all of the Obligations have
been satisfied in full (the " _Termination Date_ "), but shall not affect
Guarantors continuing liability with respect any Obligations existing or
arising prior to the Termination Date, for which this Guaranty shall remain
in full force and effect until satisfied in full.

 

16\. _Entire Agreement_. This Guaranty embodies the entire agreement
and understanding of the Guarantor with respect to its subject matter and
supersedes all oral communications and prior writings relating to the subject
matter hereof.

 

17\. _Electronic Signature; Counterparts_. A signature delivered by facsimile,
e-mail in portable document format (.pdf) or Docu _Sign_ electronic
signature system shall be deemed to be an original manual signature for
purposes of the Guaranty and shall be binding upon Guarantor and have the
same legal effect as an original manual signature. This Guaranty may be
executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but
which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

 _Exhibit I_

 

 _LIMITED GUARANTY_

 

This Limited Guaranty (" _Guaranty_ "), dated as of October 27, 2017, is made
by Talen Energy Supply, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("
_Guarantor_ "), in favor of Adelphia Gateway, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (" _Beneficiary_ ") (Guarantor and Beneficiary, together,
the " _Parties_ ", or individually a " _Party_ "). Capitalized terms used but
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning given such terms in the
Agreement (as such term is defined below).

 

Guarantor enters into this Guaranty in consideration of and as an inducement
for Beneficiary entering into that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated
as of October 27, 2017, entered into by and between Talen Generation, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (the " _Seller_ ") and Beneficiary (the "
_Agreement_ "). Guarantor derives substantial direct and/or indirect benefit
from the Agreement and the transactions thereunder and hereby acknowledges
the same. 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound hereby, Guarantor covenants and
agrees as follows: 

 

1\. _Guaranty_. Guarantor hereby irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally
guarantees to Beneficiary, as primary obligor and not as a surety, the prompt
and complete payment in immediately available funds in United States dollars
when due of all obligations (present or future, direct or indirect, secured
or unsecured, fixed or contingent and whether at stated maturity,
acceleration or otherwise) that are now or may hereafter become due and
payable from Seller to Beneficiary under the terms of the Agreement
(including, without limitation, all reasonable collection costs and
reasonable documented, out-of-pocket legal and other fees and expenses
incurred by Beneficiary in enforcing the obligations under this Guaranty
(such costs and expenses collectively, " _Enforcement Costs_ "); provided that
Guarantor shall not be liable for any Enforcement Costs if it is ultimately
determined that no payment with respect to which such enforcement was brought
under this Guaranty is due) (collectively, the " _Guaranteed_ _Liabilities_
"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, with respect
to any Guaranteed Liabilities that are subject to limits as set forth
in Article 8 of the Agreement, in no event shall Guarantors liability
for Guaranteed Liabilities under this Guaranty exceed an aggregate amount
equal to the sum of (i) the relevant limit to such liability set forth in
Article 8 of the Agreement plus (ii) Enforcement Costs.

 

2\. _Term_. This Guaranty shall be an absolute, unconditional and
continuing guaranty of payment and not of collection and will remain in full
force and effect until all Guaranteed Liabilities have been paid pursuant to
and in accordance with the Agreement (the " _Guaranty Termination Date_ ")  

 

 3\. _Waivers of Notice; Certain Defenses; Reinstatement_. Guarantor
waives: (a) all defenses that it may have under applicable law as a guarantor
or surety (other than any defenses and rights to setoff that Seller is
entitled to that arise out of the Agreement that are not (i) otherwise
expressly waived hereunder, (ii) waived under the Agreement or (iii) based
upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of Seller), (b) notice of
acceptance, presentment, demand, dishonor, protest, any sale of collateral
security and all other notices whatsoever, except for those expressly
required hereunder and (c) any and all rights to revoke this Guaranty. This
Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be,
without any release or discharge of any obligations if at any time
any payment of any of the Guaranteed Liabilities is rescinded, avoided,
recovered or must otherwise be returned by Beneficiary upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy, or reorganization of Seller, Guarantor or any other guarantor or
any other person or entity or otherwise, all as though such payment had not
been made. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Guaranty to the
contrary, Guarantor hereby reserves to itself the right to the defense that
Sellers performance is excused pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, and
all rights and remedies accorded by applicable Law to sureties or guarantors
based on the defense of the statute of limitations related to the
enforceability of this Guaranty in any action hereunder or in any action for
the payment or performance of any obligations hereby guaranteed.  

2

 

4\. _Representations and Warranties_. Guarantor hereby represents and warrants
to Beneficiary as of the date hereof that:

 

A) Guarantor is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and in good standing;

 

B) Guarantor has the power to execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under this Guaranty, and it has taken all necessary action to authorize such
execution, delivery and performance. Such execution, delivery and performance
do not (i) violate or conflict with any law applicable to Guarantor, any
provision of its constitutional documents or any order, decree, ruling, rule,
promulgation or judgment of any court or other agency of government
applicable to it or any of its assets or (ii) breach or constitute a material
default or event of default under, any agreement or instrument binding on or
affecting it or any of its assets;

 

C) All governmental and other consents, approvals, authorizations, licenses,
clearances, registrations and declarations that are required to have been
obtained by Guarantor with respect to this Guaranty have been obtained and
are in full force and effect and all conditions, if any, of all such
consents, approvals, authorizations, licenses, clearances, registrations and
declarations have been complied with or are continuing to be complied with
(to the extent continuing compliance is required); and

 

D) Guarantors obligations under this Guaranty constitute legal, valid and
binding obligations, enforceable against Guarantor in accordance with its
terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and subject,
as to enforceability, to equitable principles of general
application (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in
equity or at law)).

 

5\. _Effect of Modifications_. Guarantor acknowledges that its liability
under this Guaranty shall be absolute and unconditional and, without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, shall not be affected or impaired by (i) any
force majeure or act of government in relation to, or directly or
indirectly affecting, any of the Agreement, the Guaranteed Liabilities,
Seller, Beneficiary or Guarantor, (ii) any change in the financial condition,
objects, constituencies or business of Guarantor, Seller or Beneficiary,
(iii) any change in the corporate existence, structure, form, name or
ownership of Seller or Guarantor or any dissolution,
liquidation, reorganization, readjustment, merger, spin-off, consolidation,
transformation of corporate form, transfer of establishment or other
alteration of the legal status or structure of Seller or Guarantor, (iv) the
bankruptcy, winding-up, liquidation, dissolution, insolvency, reorganization
or other similar proceeding affecting Seller or its assets or any resulting
release, stay or discharge of any Guaranteed Liabilities, (v) any purported
or actual assignment of any of the Guaranteed Liabilities or transfer or
purported transfer of any property to or from Seller, Guarantor or any other
person or entity, (vi) any lack or limitation of power, incapacity or
disability on the part of Seller or of its directors, partners or agents or
any other irregularity, defect or informality on the part of Seller in the
Guaranteed Liabilities or (vii) the existence, validity, enforceability or
perfection, or lack of any of the foregoing, of any collateral for any of the
Guaranteed Liabilities or any negligence or mistake in handling, disposing
of, obtaining or failing to collect or perfect a security interest in any
collateral for the Guaranteed Liabilities. Guarantor further agrees and
consents that Beneficiary may at any time and from time to time, without
notice to or further consent of Guarantor (i) extend or otherwise change the
time, manner or place of payment of, accelerate, add, accept,
exchange, receive, realize upon, settle, perfect, extend, renew, pay
compromise, discharge, release or surrender any collateral for or with
respect to, or renew, any or all of the Guaranteed Liabilities, (ii) make any
agreement with Seller for the acceleration, addition, acceptance, exchange,
receipt, realization, settlement, perfection, extension, renewal, payment,
compromise, discharge, release or surrender thereof or composition,
forbearance or concession in respect of any or all of the Guaranteed
Liabilities, in whole or in part, or for any amendment, waiver or other
modification of the terms of the Agreement or of the Guaranteed Liabilities,
(iii) enter into any other current or future agreement between or among
Beneficiary, Seller and/or any other person or entity and (iv) apply all
amounts at any time received from Seller or from collateral with respect to
the Guaranteed Liabilities as Beneficiary sees fit or change any such
application in whole or in part from time to time as Beneficiary sees
fit, without, in each of the foregoing cases referred to in clauses (i),
(ii), (iii) and (iv) above, in any way affecting this Guaranty.  

3

 

6\. _Independent Obligations; Subrogation_. Guarantors obligations under
this Guaranty are independent of all obligations of Seller to Beneficiary.
Beneficiary shall not be required to proceed first against Seller or any
other person, firm or corporation or any assets thereof or collateral before
proceeding against Guarantor under this Guaranty. Guarantor shall not be
subrogated to any of the rights (or if subrogated by operation of law,
Guarantor hereby waives such rights to the extent permitted by applicable
law) of Beneficiary as the result of any payment or enforcement of any of the
Guaranteed Liabilities until the Guaranty Termination Date. If any amount
shall be paid to Guarantor on account of subrogation at any time prior to the
Guaranty Termination Date, such amount shall be held by Guarantor in trust
for Beneficiary, segregated from other funds of Guarantor, and shall,
forthwith upon receipt by Guarantor, be turned over to Beneficiary in the
exact form received by Guarantor (duly endorsed by Guarantor to Beneficiary,
if required) to be applied against the Guaranteed Liabilities, whether due or
to become due, in such order as Beneficiary may determine. On the Guaranty
Termination Date, Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of Beneficiary
against Seller with respect to any and all such payments made by Guarantor
hereunder, and Beneficiary agrees to take such steps as Guarantor
may reasonably request, at Guarantors expense, to confirm and/or implement
such subrogation rights.  

4

 

7\. _No Exhaustion of Remedies; Cumulative Rights; No Double Recovery_.
Beneficiary is not bound or obligated to exhaust its recourse against Seller
or any other person or entity or any collateral it may hold or take any other
action before being entitled to receive payment from Guarantor. Each and
every right, remedy and power hereby granted to Beneficiary or afforded it by
applicable law or agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any
other and may be exercised by Beneficiary from time to time. If any fact,
circumstance or condition forming a basis for a claim for recovery under this
Guaranty shall overlap with any fact, circumstance, condition, agreement or
event forming the basis of any other claim for recovery under this Guaranty,
there shall be no duplication in recovery for the amounts due under such
claims.

10\. _Miscellaneous_. This Guaranty and each of its provisions may be waived,
modified or varied, in whole or in part, only pursuant to a duly authorized
written instrument signed by an authorized officer of both Beneficiary and
Guarantor. No failure by Beneficiary to exercise its rights under this
Guaranty shall give rise to any estoppel against Beneficiary or excuse
Guarantor from performing under this Guaranty. No waiver by Beneficiary of
performance by Guarantor under any of the provisions of this Guaranty
shall be construed as a waiver of any subsequent performance by Guarantor
under the same or any other provisions of this Guaranty. The headings used in

the construction of, or to be taken into consideration in interpreting,
this Guaranty. No failure on the part of any party hereto to exercise, and no
delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by any party hereto

granted to each party hereto or allowed it by law or other agreement shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by any party
hereto at any time or from time to time.

Section 11 shall be null and void,  _ab initio_.  

6

 

12\. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Guaranty shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard
to any conflict of laws principles thereof or of any other jurisdiction.
Guarantor hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the

the borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, or if such court does not
have jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York
County, for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out
of this Guaranty or any transaction contemplated hereby. Guarantor hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue

the Southern District of New York or (b) the Supreme Court of the State of
