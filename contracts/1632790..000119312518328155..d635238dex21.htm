PURCHASE AND SALE OF BATTERY COMPANIES EQUITY INTERESTS AND TRANSFERRED
ASSETS; ASSUMPTION OF ASSUMED LIABILITIES

 

Section 2.01 _Purchase and Sale of Battery Companies Equity Interests and
Transferred Assets; Exclusion of Excluded Assets_.

 

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Amended
Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall (or, as applicable, shall cause the
Subsidiary Transferors to) sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver to
Purchaser (or, as applicable, one or more Affiliates of Purchaser designated
by Purchaser not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date),
and Purchaser shall (or, as applicable, shall cause such Affiliates of
Purchaser to) purchase and accept from Seller (or, as applicable, the
Subsidiary Transferors) all of (i) Sellers and Subsidiary Transferors right,
title and interest in the Battery Companies Equity Interests, free and clear
of all Liens, other than Liens arising pursuant to the terms of this Amended
Agreement or Liens created by or through Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
and Liens related to applicable securities Laws and any Lien arising under
the organizational documents of a Battery Company, correct and complete copies
of which have been made available to Purchaser and (ii) Sellers and its
Subsidiaries right, title and interest in the Transferred Assets. For the
avoidance of doubt, the property and assets of the Transferred Entities
constituting Transferred Assets shall transfer to Purchaser automatically by
operation of Law upon the sale of the Battery Companies Equity Interests.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Amended Agreement to the
contrary, no asset, claim, right or benefit, the assignment or transfer of
which is otherwise contemplated by this Amended Agreement, shall be assigned
or transferred if such assignment or transfer (or attempt to make such an
assignment or transfer) without the consent or approval of a third
party would constitute a breach or other contravention of the rights of such
third party or would constitute a violation of or be ineffective under
applicable Law (such assets, claims, rights or benefits being collectively
referred to herein as " _Restricted Assets_ ") until such consent or approval
is obtained, or other action has been taken, at which time such Restricted
Asset shall be automatically assigned or transferred. Subject to the final
sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 6.04(a)_, each party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any such consent or approval as promptly as
practicable after the date of the Original Agreement. If any such consent or
approval is not obtained prior to the Closing, (i) each party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such consent or approval as
promptly as practicable, (ii) the assigning party shall endeavor to provide
the assignee party, to the extent practicable and permitted by applicable
Law, with the benefits (including Tax benefits) of or with respect to the
applicable Restricted Asset as if such Restricted Asset had been assigned to
the assignee party (including by means of any licensing, operating,
subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangement), if the same is
permitted under the applicable Restricted Asset and (iii) the assignee party
shall bear and indemnify the assigning party for (except to the
extent resulting from or arising out of the bad faith, gross negligence,
willful misconduct or violation of applicable Law by the assigning party) all
the costs (including Tax costs), Liabilities, burdens and other Losses
incurred with respect to any such Restricted Asset to the extent that it
receives the corresponding benefits of or with respect to the applicable
Restricted Asset under clause (ii) and subject to the limitation set forth in
the final sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 6.04(a)_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.01(b)_
shall not apply with respect to the Battery Companies Equity Interests and
the Battery Company Subsidiaries Equity Interests.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Amended Agreement to the
contrary, to the extent that registered ownership of the Battery Companies
Equity Interests or the Battery Company Subsidiaries Equity Interests is not
transferred to Purchaser or its designated Affiliate as of the Closing Date,
(i) Seller (or, as applicable, the Subsidiary Transferor) shall to the
maximum extent permitted by

 



29

    

 applicable Law hold the Battery Companies Equity Interests and the Battery
Company Subsidiaries Equity Interests as nominee or trustee for the benefit
of Purchaser or its designated Affiliate until the Battery Companies Equity
Interests and the Battery Company Subsidiaries Equity Interests have been
formally registered in the name of Purchaser or its designated Affiliate and
(ii) Seller shall to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law provide
to Purchaser or its designated Affiliate the benefits associated with the
registered ownership of the Battery Companies Equity Interests and the Battery
Company Subsidiaries Equity Interests and to take or cause its applicable
Affiliate to take, such other actions (including voting as Purchaser shall
direct as the registered holder of such Equity Interests) as may be reasonably
requested by Purchaser in order to place Purchaser and its Affiliates, to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, in the same position as if
Purchaser or its designated Affiliate were the registered holder of the
Battery Companies Equity Interests and the Battery Company Subsidiaries
Equity Interests. Purchaser shall, except to the extent resulting from or
arising out of the bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct or
violation of applicable Law by Seller or its Affiliates, indemnify and hold
harmless Seller (or, as applicable, the Subsidiary Transferor) against any
and all Losses incurred, suffered or sustained by Seller (or, as applicable,
the Subsidiary Transferor) or asserted against Seller (or, as applicable, the
Subsidiary Transferor) in connection with Seller (or, as applicable, the
Subsidiary Transferor) holding the Battery Companies Equity Interests and the
Battery Company Subsidiaries Equity Interests as nominee or trustee for
Purchaser or its designated Affiliate.

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and notwithstanding any
other provision of this Amended Agreement to the contrary, this Amended
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to sell, transfer, convey, assign
and deliver any Battery Companies Equity Interest or Transferred Asset or
perform any Pre-Closing Restructuring activities, if an attempted sale,
transfer, conveyance, assignment, delivery or performance thereof would,
without the approval, authorization or consent of, or notification,
information and/or consultation with, any trade union, employee
representatives, works councils or health and safety committees or employees,
or similar Persons in foreign jurisdictions (collectively, " _Approvals_ "),
(i) constitute a material breach or violation thereof, (ii) be ineffective,
void or voidable, or (iii) materially and adversely affect the rights
thereunder of Seller, the Subsidiary Transferors, Purchaser, or any of their
respective officers, directors, agents or Affiliates, in each case unless such
Approval is obtained or such notification, information and/or consultation
has been completed. In such case, the Foreign Acquisition Agreements would be
signed and effective only once employee representatives, works councils or
health and safety committees have been duly notified, informed and/or
consulted under applicable Law, and Seller agrees to, and to cause its
applicable Subsidiaries to, timely use their reasonable best efforts to obtain
each such Approval or complete such notification, information
and/or consultation in accordance with applicable Law following the execution
and delivery of the Original Agreement.

Section 2.02  _Assumption of Assumed Liabilities; Retention of Retained
Liabilities_ _._

(a) At the Closing, Purchaser shall (or shall cause one or more of its
Affiliates designated by Purchaser in writing not less than five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date to) assume and become obligated to pay, perform
and discharge, when due, all Assumed Liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Liabilities of the Transferred Entities constituting Assumed Liabilities
shall be assumed by Purchaser automatically by operation of Law upon the sale
of the Battery Company Equity Interests.

 

(b) At the Closing, Seller and its applicable Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, shall keep or assume at the Closing and remain or become at the Closing
obligated to pay, perform and discharge when due all Retained Liabilities.

 



30

    

Section 2.03 _Purchase Price; Allocation of Purchase Price_ _._

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Amended Agreement, in
consideration for the sale and transfer of the Battery Companies
Equity Interests and the Transferred Assets under _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_
and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, Purchaser shall pay, or cause
to be paid, to Seller (or, as applicable, one or more Affiliates of Seller
designated by Seller, which is the transferor of the relevant Battery Company
Equity Interests or Transferred Assets not less than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date) an amount of cash equal to Two Billion Dollars
($2,000,000,000) (the " _Unadjusted Purchase Price_ ") _plus_ (A)(i) if the
Modified Working Capital is greater than the Working Capital Upper Target, the
amount equal to the Modified Working Capital _minus_ the Working Capital Upper
Target or (ii) if the Modified Working Capital is less than the Working
Capital Lower Target, the amount equal to the Modified Working Capital _minus_
the Working Capital Lower Target _plus_ (B) the amount, which may be positive
or negative, equal to the Closing Net Indebtedness, _minus_ (C) the amount
equal to the Closing Transaction Expenses, _minus_ (D) the Pension Plan
Purchase Price Adjustment (the Unadjusted Purchase Price, so adjusted, the "
_Purchase Price_ ").

(b) As used in this Amended Agreement, the " _Estimated Purchase Price_ "
shall mean an amount equal to the Unadjusted Purchase Price _plus_ (A)(i) if
the Estimated Modified Working Capital is greater than the Working Capital
Upper Target, the amount equal to the Estimated Modified Working Capital
_minus_ the Working Capital Upper Target or (ii) if the Estimated Modified
Working Capital is less than the Working Capital Lower Target, the amount
equal to the Estimated Modified Working Capital _minus_ the Working Capital
Lower Target, _plus_  (B) the amount, which may be positive or negative,
equal to the Estimated Closing Net Indebtedness, _minus_ (C) the amount equal
to the Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses, _minus_ (D) the Pension Plan
Purchase Price Adjustment. For purposes of determining the amount of cash to
be paid as the Estimated Purchase Price by Purchaser at the Closing pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.06(b)(ii)_, Seller shall prepare and deliver to
Purchaser, not less than three (3) Business Days before the Closing Date, a
written statement certified by an officer of Seller (the " _Closing Notice_ ")
setting forth Sellers good faith estimate of: (i) the Modified Working
Capital (such amount, the " _Estimated Modified Working Capital_ "), (ii) the
Closing Net Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Closing Net Indebtedness_ "), (iii)
the Closing Transaction Expenses (" _Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses_
") and (iv) the Estimated Purchase Price. Seller agrees that it shall prepare
such Closing Notice in accordance with, as applicable, the definitions of
"Closing Net Indebtedness" and "Closing Transaction Expenses" and, in the
case of the Estimated Modified Working Capital, such Closing Notice shall be
prepared in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, and Seller shall deliver together with such Closing Notice any
reasonable supporting material with respect to any estimated amounts used by
Seller in calculating the amounts set forth on such Closing Notice. Purchaser
shall have two (2) Business Days from the receipt of the Closing Notice to
provide Seller any comments with respect to the computation of any of the
components of Estimated Modified Working Capital, Estimated Closing Net
Indebtedness and Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses, which comments
shall be considered by Seller in good faith (it being understood that Seller
shall be under no obligation to revise such Closing Notice in response to
Purchasers comments). In the event Seller revises such Closing Notice in
response to Purchasers comments, the revised statement incorporating revised
estimates of the Estimated Modified Working Capital, Estimated Closing Net
Indebtedness and Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses, as applicable, shall
be treated as the Closing Notice hereunder.

(c) The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be allocated in accordance with the
principles set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter. Within sixty (60) days after the Purchase Price shall have been deemed
to be final pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ below, Seller shall deliver
to Purchaser a certificate that reasonably allocates the Purchase Price and
the Assumed Liabilities among the

 



31

    

 Transferred Entities (or the assets thereof in the case of any Transferred
Entity the assets of which are treated as being acquired by Purchaser or any
of its designated Affiliates for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and the
Transferred Assets in a manner consistent with _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter and in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Allocation
Certificate_ "). Purchaser shall have a period of twenty (20) days after the
delivery of the Allocation Certificate (the " _Response Period_ ") to present
in writing to Seller notice of any objections Purchaser may have to the
allocation set forth therein (an " _Objections Notice_ "). Unless Purchaser
timely objects, such Allocation Certificate shall be binding on the parties
without further adjustment, absent manifest error. If Purchaser raises any
objections within the Response Period, Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in
good faith and use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such dispute. If
the parties fail to agree within fifteen (15) days after the delivery of the
Objections Notice, then the disputed items shall be resolved by the Accounting
Arbitrator, whose determination shall be final and binding on the parties. The
Accounting Arbitrator shall resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after
the item has been referred to it. The costs, fees and expenses of the
Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne equally by Seller and Purchaser. Except
as otherwise required by a final determination (within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code or similar provision of applicable Tax law or any other
event (including the execution of a Form 870-AD) that finally and conclusively
establishes the amount of any liability for Tax), (i) Purchaser and Seller
shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries, or, in the case of
Purchaser, its Affiliates, to) report the national, federal, state, provincial
and local income and other Tax consequences of the transactions contemplated
by this Amended Agreement in a manner consistent with the Allocation
Certificate, and (ii) neither Purchaser nor Seller shall (and neither party
shall permit its respective Subsidiaries to) take a position inconsistent with
the Allocation Certificate on any Tax Return or filings (including any forms
required to be filed pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code). Each of Seller and
Purchaser shall cooperate with the other in preparing IRS Form 8594 or any
equivalent statements required by any Governmental Authority charged with the
collection of any income Tax for filing within a reasonable period before its
filing due date. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_ to
the contrary, to the extent it is necessary to allocate the Estimated
Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities among the Transferred Entities and
the Transferred Assets (or any subset thereof) prior to the final
determination of the Allocation Certificate in connection with any of the
transactions governed by the Foreign Acquisition Agreements (or other local
closing agreements and documents required to effectuate the transactions
contemplated hereby for jurisdictions outside of the United States), each of
Seller and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their Subsidiaries to) reasonably
cooperate in good faith to agree upon such allocation in a manner consistent
with _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

 

Section 2.04 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth
certain current assets and current Liabilities accounts and certain
accounting principles, methodologies and policies used in the determination of
such accounts. Such accounts of the Business, cumulatively, as of immediately
before the effective time of the Closing (as set forth in  _Section_ __ _
2.05(a)_), determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter, and the principles, methodologies and policies set
forth therein and, to the extent not set forth therein, in accordance with
U.S. GAAP, shall constitute the " _Modified Working Capital_ ". For the
avoidance of doubt, amounts included in the determination of Closing Net
Indebtedness, Closing Transaction Expenses and Pension Plan Purchase Price
Adjustment shall be excluded from the determination of the Modified Working
Capital.

(b) If the Purchase Price as finally determined in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 2.04_ is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, Seller shall
pay to Purchaser the total amount of such deficit, and if the Purchase Price
as finally determined in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ exceeds
the Estimated Purchase Price, Purchaser shall pay to Seller the total amount
of such excess, in either case by wire transfer of immediately available U.S.
dollar funds, within three (3) Business Days after the final determination of
the Purchase Price, to an account designated by the party receiving payment no
later than two (2) Business Days after the final determination of the Purchase
Price.

(c) As promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within ninety (90) days
after the Closing), Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement
setting forth Purchasers calculation of (i) Modified Working Capital, (ii)
Closing Net Indebtedness, (iii) Closing Transaction Expenses and (iv)
the Purchase Price pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ (the " _Closing
Statement_ "), which shall be prepared in accordance with the accounting
principles, methodologies and policies set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ of
the Seller Disclosure Letter (and, to the extent not set forth therein, in
accordance with U.S. GAAP). The parties agree to provide each other and their
respective Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours
and upon reasonable notice, to their respective books, records, work papers
and personnel (and any other information which either party reasonably
requests to the extent relating to the Business (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, the Business in any Deferred Asset Jurisdictions)) throughout the
periods during which the Closing Statement is being prepared or evaluated and
any disputes that may arise under this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ are being
resolved, in each case in a manner that does not interfere unreasonably with
the operations of such partys businesses. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Purchaser nor Seller shall be required to (x) violate any obligation
of confidentiality to which Purchaser or Seller may be subject in discharging
their obligations pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, and (y)
provide access to or disclose information where, upon the advice of counsel,
such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of
such party or contravene any applicable Laws. If Seller disagrees with the
determination of the Closing Statement, Seller shall notify Purchaser in
writing of such disagreement within sixty (60) days after delivery of the
Closing Statement, which written notice shall set forth any such disagreement
in reasonable detail (" _Disagreement Notice_ "). If Seller fails to deliver a
Disagreement Notice by the end of such sixty (60)-day period, Seller shall be
deemed to have accepted the Closing Statement delivered by Purchaser. Matters
included in the calculations in the Closing Statement to which Seller does not
object in the Disagreement Notice shall be deemed accepted by Seller and
shall not be subject to further dispute or review. Purchaser and Seller shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disagreement, and any resolution
agreed to in writing by Purchaser and Seller shall be final and binding upon
the parties.

(d) If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve any disagreement
as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.04(c)_ within thirty (30) days after
delivery by Seller of a Disagreement Notice, Purchaser and Seller shall
jointly select a mutually acceptable nationally recognized third party
accounting firm, the retention of which will not give rise to present or
potential future auditor independence problems for Seller, Purchaser or any of
their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries, as determined by the reasonable
discretion of Seller and Purchaser, to resolve such disagreement (the firm so
selected shall be referred to herein as the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ "). In
the event that Purchaser and Seller are unable to agree on the appointment of
the Accounting Arbitrator, as provided above, then the Accounting Arbitrator
shall be appointed, at the request of either Purchaser or Seller, by the
American Arbitration Association, which Accounting Arbitrator shall be another
nationally recognized third party accounting firm. The parties shall instruct
the Accounting Arbitrator to consider only those items and amounts set forth
in the Closing Statement as to which Purchaser has disagreed pursuant to a
Disagreement Notice and Purchaser and Seller have not resolved their
disagreement. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting
Arbitrator shall be limited to whether such calculation was done in accordance
with the terms hereof, the accounting methods, standards, policies,
practices, classifications, estimation methodologies, assumptions or
procedures used to prepare the Closing Statement, and whether there were
mathematical errors in the calculation of the Closing Statement, and the
Accounting Arbitrator shall not make any other determination. The Accounting
Arbitrator shall make its determination based solely on written submissions,
presentations and supporting material provided by Purchaser and Seller and not
pursuant to any independent review. In resolving any such disagreement, the
Accounting Arbitrator may only select

 



33

    

 an amount for each item in dispute that is within range of values
established for such disputed item as determined by reference to the value
assigned to such item by Seller in the Disagreement Notice and by Purchaser
in the Closing Statement. Purchaser and Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Arbitrator to deliver to all
parties, as promptly as practicable, a written report setting forth the
resolution of any such disagreement determined in accordance with the terms
of this Amended Agreement. Such report shall be final and binding upon the
parties, absent manifest error. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting
Arbitrator arising in connection with this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ shall be
borne by Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, in
proportion to the differences between the Purchase Price as determined by the
Accounting Arbitrator and the asserted Purchase Price set forth in the
Closing Statement and the Disagreement Notice, respectively.

(e) Purchaser and Seller agree that any payments made pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.04_ shall be allocated in a manner consistent with any
allocation agreed to pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_.

 

(f) With respect to Cash and Cash Equivalents and Indebtedness of the Business
denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, the Applicable Exchange
Rate for each such currency as of immediately before the effective time of the
Closing as published by Bloomberg (BGN New York), shall be used to convert
such amounts into U.S. dollars for purposes of determining Closing
Net Indebtedness in connection with the adjustments pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.04_.

Section 2.05 _The Closing_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Amended Agreement (including
_Section_ __ _ 2.05(b)_), the sale and purchase of the Battery Companies
Equity Interests and the Transferred Assets and the assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities (all as contemplated hereby, the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
by electronic exchange of documents, (i) on the first (1st) Business Day of
the month following the later of (A) the third (3rd) Business Day following
satisfaction or waiver in writing (to the extent permitted by applicable Law)
of the party entitled to the benefit thereof of all of the conditions to the
obligations of the parties set forth in _Article IX_ (other than those
conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied only at the Closing,
but subject to the written waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law)
of the party entitled to the benefit thereof or fulfillment of those
conditions) and (B) the date that is three (3) Business Days following the
receipt by the Purchaser of the Additional Financial Statements (subject, in
the case of this clause (B), to the satisfaction or waiver in writing (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law) of the party entitled to the benefit
thereof of all of the conditions set forth in _Article IX_ as of the date
determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.05(a)_ (other than those
conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied only at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or written waiver (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) of the party entitled to the benefit thereof of those
conditions)) or (ii) at such other time and date or at such other place
as Seller and Purchaser may mutually agree upon in writing (the day on which
the Closing takes place being the " _Closing Date_ "). For the sake of
clarity, the transfer of the Battery Companies Equity Interests and the
Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities will be deemed to take place and
be effective in each jurisdiction at 12:01 A.M. local time (in the case of the
United States, local time being New York time), on the day of the Closing Date
(x) where the principal office or facilities of such Battery Company is
located or (y) in the case of Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities, where
the Transferred Asset or Assumed Liability resides, exists or arises.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Amended Agreement, if (i)
any Consent of a Governmental Authority required to consummate the sale and
transfer of the Battery Companies Equity Interests and the Transferred Assets
or the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities in any applicable jurisdiction
has not been obtained at the time of Closing (other than, for the avoidance
of doubt, the expiration or termination of the waiting period (and any
extension thereof) under the HSR Act, and the waiting periods, clearances,
approvals and/or Consents under the applicable Review Law in each 

 



34

    

 of the other Specified Jurisdictions), (ii) despite the exercise by Seller
of its reasonable best efforts, the Pre-Closing Restructuring has not
been completed in any applicable jurisdiction as of the Closing, (iii)
despite the exercise by Purchaser of its reasonable best efforts, Purchasers
designated Affiliate in any applicable jurisdiction (A) is not fully formed,
organized or incorporated, or (B) has not received the Governmental
Authorizations necessary for the conduct of the Business in such jurisdiction
prior to the Closing Date or (iv) either party determines, in good faith, that
it is not reasonably practicable to consummate the sale and transfer of the
Battery Companies Equity Interests or the Transferred Assets and the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities in particular jurisdictions on the
Closing Date (each such jurisdiction in which the circumstances described in
clauses (i) through (iv) above apply, a " _Deferred Asset Jurisdiction_ "),
then Purchaser and Seller shall, subject to this _Section_ __ _ 2.05(b)_
and  _Section_ __ _ 2.05(c)_, agree to defer (to the extent permitted under
applicable Law) the consummation of the portion of the transactions
contemplated in such Deferred Asset Jurisdiction solely with respect to the
sale and transfer of the Battery Companies Equity Interests or the
Transferred Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, as
applicable, in respect of such Deferred Asset Jurisdiction (such items for
each Deferred Asset Jurisdiction, the " _Deferred Assets and Liabilities_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that, without the written consent of the other party,
in no event shall either party have the right to defer the consummation of the
sale and transfer of the Battery Companies Equity Interests or the
Transferred Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, as
applicable, (x) in the United States or in the other jurisdictions set forth
on _Section_ __ _ 2.05(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter or (y) if such
deferral would result in the Deferred Asset Jurisdictions accounting for 10%
or more of the net sales of the Business in fiscal year 2017.

 

(c) From and after the Closing, and until such time as the applicable Deferred
Assets and Liabilities have been transferred to Purchaser pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.05(b)_ (each, a " _Deferred Transfer Closing_ "), such
Deferred Assets and Liabilities will be held for Purchasers benefit and
account and will be managed and operated by Seller and its Subsidiaries for
the benefit and account of Purchaser, with all gains, income, Losses, Taxes
and Tax benefits or other items generated thereby to be for the account of
Purchaser or its designated Affiliate. Seller and Purchaser will use
their respective reasonable best efforts to allow Purchaser or its designated
Affiliate to receive the uninterrupted use and benefit of any Deferred Assets
and Liabilities from the Closing Date to the date of its Deferred Transfer
Closing. Except as otherwise contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ or
the other provisions of this Amended Agreement, to the extent permitted under
applicable Law, until the applicable Deferred Transfer Closing occurs, Seller
will conduct the Business in such Deferred Asset Jurisdiction in accordance
with the reasonable and lawful instructions of Purchaser and, except to the
extent resulting from or arising out of the bad faith, gross negligence,
willful misconduct or violation of applicable Law by Seller or its
Affiliates, Purchaser shall defend and indemnify the Seller Indemnified
Persons and save and hold each of them harmless against any Losses incurred,
sustained or suffered by them arising out of or as a result of
the performance by Seller and its Affiliates of its and their respective
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ in respect of any Deferred Assets
and Liabilities from and after the Closing until the applicable Deferred
Transfer Closing in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 2.05_.

(d) The Deferred Transfer Closing of any Deferred Assets and Liabilities
shall occur as promptly as is reasonably practicable after the resolution of
the applicable circumstance described in clauses (i) through (iv) of the first
sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 2.05(b)_ that caused such jurisdiction to be a
Deferred Asset Jurisdiction or at such time as the Parties may mutually agree
upon in writing. In connection with any Deferred Transfer Closing where the
parties jointly determine that the applicable portion of the Purchase Price
is required to be paid on such Deferred Transfer Closing by Purchasers
designated Affiliate to the applicable Subsidiary Transferor in local
currency: (a) at the Deferred Transfer Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall
cause the applicable designated Affiliate to, deliver such portion of the
Purchase Price by wire transfer in immediately available funds, to an account
or accounts designated at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Deferred
Closing Date by Seller in a written notice to Purchaser; and (b) no later than
two (2) Business Days following such Deferred Transfer Closing, Seller shall
return 

 



35

    

 to Purchaser that portion of the Estimated Purchase Price or Purchase Price
(as applicable) allocated to the applicable Deferred Transfer Jurisdiction in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_ of this Amended Agreement by wire
transfer in immediately available funds, to an account or accounts designated
at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Deferred Closing Date by
Purchaser in a written notice to Seller. Any amounts payable in local
currency shall be determined by reference to the applicable spot rate
published by Bloomberg (BGN New York) as of 5:00 P.M., New York time, on the
date that is three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (and, for
clarity, not the date of the Deferred Transfer Closing).

(e) For purposes of  _Sections_ __ _ 2.01_, _2.02_ , _2.06(a)(i)_ ,
_2.06(a)(ii)_ _, 2.06(a)(iii)_ , _2.06(b)(i)_ , _3.04(c)_ , _6.02_ , _6.04(a)_
, _6.06_ , _6.10_ , _6.14(d)_ , _7.01_ , _7.02_ ,  _8.04_ and _8.05_ , to the
extent applicable in connection with any Deferred Asset Jurisdiction, all
references to the Closing or the Closing Date in such instances shall be
deemed to be references to the applicable Deferred Transfer Closing or date
of the applicable Deferred Transfer Closing, respectively.

Section 2.06 _Deliveries for the Closing_.

 

(a) At the Closing, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
Purchaser:

 

(i) instruments of transfer and conveyance, properly executed and acknowledged
by Seller and/or its applicable Subsidiaries in such customary form as is

Liabilities to Purchaser (or to such Affiliate(s) of Purchaser designated
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_), including, a warranty deed (in form
customary in the applicable jurisdiction) with respect to each Owned Real

(other than the Identified Lease) in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser;

 

(ii) certificates representing the Battery Companies Equity Interests (to the
extent certificated), duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by stock or unit
powers duly endorsed in blank in proper form for transfer or other proper
instruments of transfer, along with such other documentation or filings as may
be required under applicable Law to vest in Purchaser (or in such Affiliate(s)
of Purchaser designated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_) the Battery
Company Interests;

(iii) a counterpart of each of the Ancillary Agreements, executed by each of
Seller and any of its Subsidiaries that is a party thereto, to the extent not

_Section_ __ _ 2.06(a)(vii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter to the
assignment of such Real Property Lease (the " _Lease Consent_ ").

 



36

    

(b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller:

 

(i) a counterpart of each of the Ancillary Agreements (other than the Bill of
Sale), executed by each of Purchaser and any of its Affiliates that is a
party thereto, to the extent not previously delivered;

(ii) the Estimated Purchase Price by wire transfer in immediately available
funds, to an account or accounts designated at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date by Seller in a written notice to Purchaser;

Interests acknowledging the purchase of the Transferred Assets and Battery
Companies Equity Interests pursuant to this Amended Agreement; and

(iv) the certificates referred to in  _Section_ __ _ 9.01(a)_ and _Section_
__ _ 9.01(b)_.

Section 2.07 _Accounting_. To the extent that, after the Closing, (a)
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates receives any payment that is properly for
the account of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Transferred Entities) according to the terms of this
Amended Agreement (including any payment in respect of or under any Excluded
Asset or otherwise due to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries) or, with the
prior written consent of Purchaser, Seller or any of its Subsidiaries makes
a payment on behalf of Purchaser or any of its designated Affiliate(s)
(including any payment in respect of or under any Assumed Liability or
otherwise payable by the Business), Purchaser shall promptly deliver such
amount to Seller, and (b) Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Transferred Entities) receives any payment that is
properly for the account of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates according to
the terms of this Amended Agreement (including any payment in respect of or
under any Transferred Asset or otherwise due to the Business) or, with the
prior written consent of Seller, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates makes a
payment on behalf of Seller (including any payment in respect of or under any
Retained Liability or otherwise payable by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries),
Seller shall promptly deliver such amount to Purchaser, in each case, pursuant
to a mutually agreed weekly cash reconciliation and off-set process conducted
by the parties. All amounts due and payable under this _Section_ __ _ 2.07_
__ shall be due and payable by the applicable party in immediately available
funds, by wire transfer to the account designated in writing by the other
party.

Section 2.08 _Withholding_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold (or cause to be deducted and withheld) from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Amended Agreement such amounts as Purchaser
or any of its designated Affiliates is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law; _provided_ that Purchaser shall provide
written notice to Seller of any expected deduction or withholding at least
five (5) Business Days prior to the withholding (which notice shall specify
the legal authority and the calculation method for the expected withholding);
_provided_ , _further_ , that Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith with
Seller (including by providing Seller with a reasonable opportunity to
provide any applicable certificates, forms or documentation that would reduce
or eliminate any such deduction or withholding) and shall otherwise take such
steps as Seller may reasonably request to reduce or eliminate, such
requirement to withhold Tax. To the extent that such amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the proper Governmental Authority, such withheld and deducted
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Amended Agreement as
having been paid to Seller and the Subsidiary Transferors (as applicable) in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



37

    

Section 2.09 _Foreign_ _Acquisition Agreements_. Subject to the terms
and conditions hereof, the parties shall, or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, enter into such agreements and instruments (collectively, the
" _Foreign Acquisition Agreements_ ") providing for the sale, transfer,
conveyance, assignment or delivery of any Transferred Asset, Battery
Companies Equity Interest and/or the assumption of any Assumed Liability
located outside the United States of America as the parties jointly determine
would be required or advisable pursuant to, or to comply with, requirements
of applicable local Law to be documented separately from this Amended
Agreement, which Foreign Acquisition Agreements shall be negotiated in good
faith between the parties, but in all events shall be consistent with the
terms of this Amended Agreement and have appropriate provisions to pay the
applicable portion of the Purchase Price, as applicable, in local currency if
necessary (which will reduce the corresponding obligation to make payment
under this Amended Agreement) in such amounts and such countries as jointly
determined by the parties and shall contain customary provisions as agreed to
by the parties with respect to local law and Tax matters not inconsistent with
this Amended Agreement. Any amounts payable in local currency shall be
determined by reference to the applicable spot rate published by Bloomberg
(BGN New York) as of 5:00 P.M., New York time, on the date that is three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (x) nothing in the Foreign
Acquisition Agreements, express or implied, is intended to or shall be
construed to replace, substitute, modify, expand, qualify or limit in any way
the terms of this Amended Agreement and (y) to the extent that any provision
of any Foreign Acquisition Agreement conflicts or is inconsistent with the
terms of this Amended Agreement, this Amended Agreement will govern. 

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES RELATING TO SELLER AND THE BATTERY

 

COMPANIES EQUITY INTERESTS

 

Except as set forth in the Seller Disclosure Letter delivered by Seller to
Purchaser simultaneously with the execution hereof, Seller represents and
warrants to Purchaser that all of the statements contained in this _Article
III_ are true and correct as of the date of the Original Agreement and as of
the Closing Date (other than such representations and warranties that
refer to a specified date, in which case of the such date). Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Seller makes no representations and
warranties in this _Article III_ relating to the Excluded Assets or Retained
Liabilities. For purposes of the representations and warranties of Seller
contained herein, disclosure in one Section of the Seller Disclosure Letter of
any items, facts or circumstances shall be deemed to be disclosure of such
items, facts or circumstances with respect to any other representations or
warranties by Seller calling for disclosure of such information, whether or
not such disclosure is specifically associated with or purports to respond to
one or more of such other representations or warranties, if it is reasonably
apparent on the face of the Seller Disclosure Letter that such disclosure is
applicable. The inclusion of any information in any Section of the Seller
Disclosure Letter or other document delivered by Seller pursuant to this
Amended Agreement shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of the
materiality of such item, nor shall it establish a standard of materiality for
any purpose whatsoever.

 

Section 3.01 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

 

(a) Each of Seller, the Subsidiary Transferors and those of Sellers
Controlled Affiliates that are or will be parties to the Ancillary Agreements
is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (except in
any jurisdiction that does not recognize such a concept) under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization. Each of Seller, the Subsidiary Transferors
and those of Sellers Controlled Affiliates that are or will be parties to
the Ancillary Agreements (i) has all requisite power and authority to own,
lease or otherwise hold or operate its assets and properties and to conduct
its business as currently conducted, and (ii) is duly qualified or licensed
to do business and is in good standing (except in any jurisdiction that does
not recognize such a concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership, leasing, holding or operation of its assets and
properties and

 



38

    

 the conduct of its business as currently conducted makes such qualification
or licensing necessary, except, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), where
the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing, individually or
in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Seller has made available to Purchaser complete and correct copies of the
organizational documents of each of Seller and each Subsidiary Transferor,
each as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified through (and including)
the date of the Original Agreement.

 

Section 3.02 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. Seller and
its Subsidiaries had or have (as applicable) all requisite corporate power
and authority and full legal capacity to execute the Original Agreement and
this Amended Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is, or is
specified to be, a party, to fully perform its obligations hereunder
or thereunder and to consummate the Acquisition, and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery by Seller and its
Subsidiaries of the Original Agreement, this Amended Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is, or is specified to be, a party and the
consummation by Seller and the Subsidiary Transferors of the Acquisition and
the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of Seller and the Subsidiary
Transferors, and no other action on the part of Seller or the Subsidiary
Transferors is necessary to authorize this Amended Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements or the consummation of the Acquisition or the other transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. Seller has duly executed and delivered the
Original Agreement, this Amended Agreement and, at or prior to the Closing,
Seller and its Subsidiaries will have duly executed and delivered each
Ancillary Agreement to which it is, or is specified to be, a party, and,
assuming the due execution and delivery by Purchaser, this Amended Agreement
constitutes Sellers, and each Ancillary Agreement to which Seller or its
Subsidiary is, or is specified to be, a party will, after execution and
delivery by Seller or its Subsidiary (as the case may be), constitute Sellers
and such Subsidiarys legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against
it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws affecting creditors
rights generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of
whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law.

 

Section 3.03 _No Conflicts; Consents and Approvals_. Subject to (x) receipt of
the consents, approvals and waivers, and the making of the filings and
notifications, in each case listed in _Section_ __ _ 3.03_ _of the Seller

this Amended Agreement and by Seller and its Subsidiaries of each Ancillary
Agreement to which it is or will be a party, (2) the consummation by Seller or
each such Subsidiary Transferor, of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or (3) the compliance by Seller with any of the provisions hereof or
thereof, as the case may be, will:

(a) conflict with, violate or result in the breach of, any provision of
the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other organizational documents
of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries;

a " _Consent_ ") from any Governmental Authority;

(c) conflict with, violate, or result in the breach by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries of any applicable Law;

 



39

    

(d) conflict with, violate, result in the breach or termination of, or

require Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to obtain any consent, approval or
action of, make any filing with or give any notice to any Person under, give
rise to any right of termination or acceleration or otherwise adversely
modify the terms, under any Material Contract or Real Property Lease to which
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of the assets or
properties of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is bound; or

(e) result in the creation of any Lien (other than any Permitted Lien or any
Lien created by or through Purchaser) upon any of the Transferred Assets, any
of the assets of the Transferred Entities (after giving effect to the Pre-
Closing Restructuring) or any of the Battery Companies Equity Interests;

 

except, in the case of each of (b), (c), (d) and (e), where such conflict,
violation, breach, termination, default, requirement, acceleration, increase
in obligations, adverse modification or creation of Lien, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 3.04 _Equity Interests in the Transferred Entities; Equity Interests
in Other Persons_ _._

 

(a) _Exhibit A_ sets forth (i) the name and the jurisdiction of organization
of each Battery Company and each Battery Company Subsidiary (in each case to
the extent designated as such as of the date of this Amended Agreement) and
(ii) for each of the Battery Companies and Battery Company Subsidiaries, the
percentage of all outstanding equity interests in such Battery Company or
Battery Company Subsidiary, as applicable, held by Seller, the applicable
Subsidiary Transferor or Battery Company, as the case may be. Except for the
Transferred Equity Interests, there are no (x) equity interests in a
Transferred Entity issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding and (y)
preemptive or similar rights on the part of any holder of any class of
securities of any Transferred Entity. One or more of the Transferred Entities
are, and will be after giving effect to the Pre-Closing Restructuring, the
legal, record and beneficial owner of all the Battery Company Subsidiaries
Equity Interests free and clear of all Liens, other than Liens arising
pursuant to the terms of this Amended Agreement or Liens created by or
through Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and Liens related to applicable
securities Laws and any Lien arising under the organizational documents of a
Battery Company. The Transferred Equity Interests have been and after giving
effect to the Pre-Closing Restructuring, will be, duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. There are not any bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness of any Transferred Entity having the
right to vote (or that are convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable
for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which holders of
the Transferred Equity Interests may vote (" _Transferred Entity Voting Debt_
"). There are no options, calls, warrants, rights, convertible or exchangeable
securities, "phantom" stock rights, stock appreciation rights, stock-based
performance units, commitments, contracts, arrangements or undertakings to
which any Transferred Entity is a party or by which any of them is bound (A)
obligating any Transferred Entity to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be
issued, delivered or sold, additional units of its equity interests or any
security convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, any equity
interest in any Transferred Entity or any Transferred Entity Voting Debt, (B)

posted privacy policies; notices provided in connection with the Processing
of Personal Data; posted policies or notices concerning the security of
Information Technology systems, collectively referred to as " _Privacy
Policies_ "); and internal policies and standards concerning the treatment of

55

    

 Subsidiaries has implemented, and has required all third party service
providers that are a party to any Privacy Contract to implement, adequate
security measures in place to protect Personal Data collected or Processed in
connection with the Business that is stored in their Information Technology
equipment and other computer systems from unlawful use or access by any third
party or any other use by a third party that would violate the applicable
Privacy Policy or Privacy Contract (as applicable). The execution, delivery
and performance of the Transaction Documents and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby do not violate any Privacy and Information
Security Requirements, Privacy Contract or any Privacy Policy as it currently
exists or as it existed at any time during which any Personal Data was
collected or Processed in connection with the Business (to the extent such
Privacy Policy still governs the use of such Personal Data). Upon the
Closing, Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Transferred Entities will own all
such Personal Data and continue to have the right to use such Personal Data on
substantially similar terms and conditions as Seller and its Subsidiaries
enjoyed immediately prior to the Closing, subject to Purchasers compliance
with applicable Law and except for any restrictions binding upon Purchaser or
its pre-Closing Affiliates (including their granting of any Lien relating

Seller, its Subsidiaries, or any customers of Seller or its Subsidiaries (in
the case of customers, to the extent relating to the Business), by any private
party or any regulatory or other governmental body or official, foreign
or domestic, regarding the Processing of Personal Data, and no such Action
has been threatened in writing against Seller or its Subsidiaries. To the
Knowledge of Seller, no facts or circumstances exist that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to such an Action insofar as such Action relates to
Seller or its Subsidiaries. The Privacy Policies do not require the delivery
of any notice to or consent from any Person, or prohibit the transfer of any
Personal Data collected and in the possession or control of Seller or its
Subsidiaries, in connection with the execution, delivery, or performance of
the Original Agreement, this Amended Agreement or the consummation of any of
the transactions contemplated by this Amended Agreement.

part of the Business has received training regarding information security
that is relevant to each such employees or agents role and responsibility
within the Business. Seller and its Subsidiaries have deployed industry
standard encryption or other appropriate security strategies on all
portable devices and information systems containing either Personal Data or
confidential information of Seller or such Subsidiary.

(h) Each of Seller and its Subsidiaries is using reasonable efforts in
prosecuting all patent applications and all other Intellectual Property
applications to register Intellectual Property it has filed which are included
in the Acquired Intellectual Property consistent with Sellers and its
Subsidiaries past practices. Each of Seller and its Subsidiaries is using
reasonable efforts in preparing to file patent and other Intellectual Property
applications for all inventions in a manner and within a sufficient time

a true, correct and complete list of all material Software constituting Owned
Intellectual Property that is necessary, used or held for use in the operation

incorporated into, derived from or distributed with such FOSS must be (1)
disclosed or distributed in source code form, (2) be licensed for the purpose
of making derivative works or (3) be redistributable at no charge). _Section_

with, linked to, used with, or distributed with any of the Products, and the
corresponding FOSS license applicable thereto.

confidence. Consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall not
trigger any requirement or obligation for Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to

third party or otherwise provide or license such source code to a third party.

(l) All Transferred Information Technology, and Sellers and the Transferred

material substandard performance of any Information Technology of Seller and
its Subsidiaries which has caused any material disruption to the Business.
Neither Seller nor any of the Transferred Subsidiaries, nor any Transferred
Information Technology, have suffered any material data loss, business
interruption, or other

 



57

    

 harm as a result of, any Malicious Code intentionally designed to permit (i)
unauthorized access to a computer or network, (ii) unauthorized disablement or
erasure of Software, hardware or data, or (iii) any other similar type of
unauthorized activities. To Sellers Knowledge, there have been no
unauthorized intrusions or breaches of the security with respect to any of the
Transferred Information Technology. Seller and its Subsidiaries have
implemented any and all security patches or upgrades that are generally
available for the Transferred Information Technology.

release of proceeds from escrow with respect to the Escrow Notes will not be
satisfied or that the proceeds of the Debt Financing (including the
release of the proceeds of the Escrow Notes from escrow) will not be
available to Purchaser on the Closing Date. Purchaser has fully paid or has
caused to be fully paid all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid
on or prior to the date hereof pursuant to the Debt Financing Commitment and
the Escrow Indenture Documents.

(b) The obligations of Purchaser under this Amended Agreement are not subject
to any conditions regarding the ability of Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or
any other Person to obtain financing for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.08 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions to
Purchasers obligation to consummate the Acquisition, and after giving effect
to the transactions contemplated by this Amended Agreement, including the
Financing and the payment of the Estimated Purchase Price on the Closing Date,
any payment required to be made by Purchaser pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
2.04_ and all related fees and expenses and any other payment contemplated in
this Amended Agreement or the Debt Financing Commitment and (b) any repayment
or refinancing of debt contemplated in this Amended Agreement or the Debt
Financing Commitment, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will
be Solvent as of the Closing and immediately after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Amended Agreement. For purposes of
this Amended Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect to any
Person, means that, as of any date of determination (x) the amount of the
"fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such
date, exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including
contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are
generally determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing
determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be
required to pay the probable Liabilities of such Person on its existing debts
(including contingent and other Liabilities) as such debts become absolute and
mature, (y) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (z) such Person will be
able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as
they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will
be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or
refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become
due.

Section 5.09 _Exclusivity of Representations and Warranties_ _;  Non-Reliance
on Seller Estimates_.

(a) Except for the representations and warranties contained in _Article III_
and _Article IV_ , in the Ancillary Agreements or in certificates delivered by
Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.06(a)(v)_, Purchaser acknowledges that
neither Seller nor any other Person (i) is making or has made any
representation or warranty (whether express or implied) on behalf of Seller,
any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) or their respective
businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, condition (financial
or otherwise) or prospects, or any of their respective Representatives in
connection with the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby and (ii) except as expressly

 



65

    

 otherwise provided herein or in the Transaction Documents, will have or be
subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to Purchaser resulting
from the delivery, dissemination or any other distribution to Purchaser or
any of its Representatives, or the use by Purchaser or any of its
Representatives, of any materials, documentation estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or other oral or other
information during the course of due diligence or any auction or negotiation
process (including information memoranda, VDR materials, projections,
estimates, management presentations, budgets and financial data and reports).

 

(b) Without limitation of the representations and warranties contained in
_Article III_ and _Article IV_ , in the Ancillary Agreements or in
certificates delivered by Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.06(a)(v)_,
Purchaser acknowledges that in connection with the due diligence investigation
of the Business by Purchaser, Purchaser has received and may continue
to receive from Seller, its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking information, as well as certain business plan information, regarding
the Business and its operations; that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking statements, as well as in such business plans, with which Purchaser is
familiar; and that Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making its own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such business
plans, so furnished to Purchaser (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
information or business plans), and that Purchaser has not relied on such
information.

to the books, records, personnel, officers and facilities of the Business
(except that Purchaser shall not conduct any environmental sampling
or analysis (including the sort customarily referred to as a Phase II
Environmental Assessment) without the advance written consent of Seller, and
without executing a customary access and indemnity agreement in respect
thereto); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any such access shall be conducted
in a manner that complies with _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ and at Purchasers
expense, at a reasonable time, under the reasonable supervision of Sellers
personnel and in such a manner as to maintain confidentiality and not to
interfere with the normal operations of the businesses of Seller and its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything contained in this or any other
agreement between Purchaser and Seller executed on or prior to the date of
the Original Agreement, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have
any obligation to make available to Purchaser or its Representatives, or
provide Purchaser or its Representatives with, (a) any consolidated, combined
or unitary Tax Return filed by Seller or any of its Affiliates or
predecessors, or any related material, except to the extent that any such Tax
Return or related material relates solely to the Transferred Entities, the
Business or the Transferred Assets or (b) any information if making such
information available would (i) reasonably be likely to result in a waiver of
any attorney-client or other legal privilege, or (ii) contravene any
applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement (including any
confidentiality agreement to which Seller or any of its Affiliates is a party)
(it being understood that Seller shall cooperate in any reasonable efforts and
requests for waivers that would enable otherwise required disclosure to
Purchaser to occur without so jeopardizing privilege or contravening such Law,
duty or agreement).

 

Section 6.03 _Confidentiality; Publicity_.

 

(a) Purchaser and Seller shall comply with, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and their respective Representatives, to comply
with all of their respective obligations under the Mutual Non-Disclosure
Agreement, dated as of July 7, 2017, between Seller and Purchaser (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ");  _provided_ , that such obligations shall be
subject to any exceptions expressly set forth herein, including the last
sentence of _Section_ __ _ 6.12(b)_. The terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement are hereby incorporated herein by reference (subject to any
exceptions expressly set forth herein, including the last sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 6.12(d)_) and shall continue in full force

 



69

    

 and effect and survive the Closing in accordance with its terms. From and
after the Closing, the restrictions on the use and disclosure of Evaluation
Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement shall not apply to Purchaser or its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives in respect of any information solely to the
extent relating to the Business, the Transferred Entities (after giving
effect to the Pre-Closing Restructuring), the Transferred Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities. If this Amended Agreement is, for any reason, terminated
prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement, and Purchasers
obligations thereunder pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_, shall
nonetheless continue in full force and effect in all respects. In the event of
any conflict between the Confidentiality Agreement and this Amended
Agreement, this Amended Agreement shall control until the termination of this
Amended Agreement without the Closing having occurred.

 

(b) The timing and content of the initial public announcement regarding the
Original Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby to the general public shall be mutually agreed
upon in advance by Seller and Purchaser; _provided_ , that if any subsequent
public disclosure is required by applicable Law, U.S. GAAP or by the rules
and regulations of, or pursuant to any agreement of a stock exchange or
trading system to be made by Purchaser or Seller and would vary in any
material respect from the initial agreed upon public announcement, such party
shall be permitted to issue such public disclosure only if it has provided
the other party with reasonable advance notice and opportunity to review and
comment on such disclosure. Seller shall not, and Seller shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities) not to, issue any broadly
distributed communication of a general nature to employees of the Business
(including general communications relating to benefits and compensation)
related to the Original Agreement or this Amended Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without providing Purchaser with reasonable
advance notice and opportunity to review and comment on such communication.

 

Section 6.04 _Reasonable Best Efforts and Actions to Cause the Closing to
Occur_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Amended Agreement, Purchaser and Seller shall (and each of them shall cause
their respective Affiliates to) use their respective reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done and
cooperate with each other in order to do, all things necessary, proper
or advisable (including by cooperating in advance of any potential filing
contemplated by the second succeeding sentence) to consummate the Closing as
promptly as practicable, including using their reasonable best efforts: (x) to
cause the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and notices
required to be filed to consummate the Closing and the taking of all other
such reasonable actions as are necessary or advisable to obtain any requisite
approvals, authorizations, consents, clearances, orders, licenses, permits,
qualifications, exemptions or waivers, to avoid an Action by, or to lift any
injunction or other legal bar to the consummation of the Acquisition by any
third party or Governmental Authority relating to Review Laws and (y) to
cause the conditions to the Closing specified in _Article IX_ to be satisfied.
In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Purchaser
and Seller agrees to file, or cause to be filed, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date of the Original Agreement all notification and
report forms or applications that may be required under Review Laws with
respect to the Acquisition. In the event the Closing has not occurred on
or prior to March 28, 2019, and if required in the reasonable judgment of
either Purchaser or Seller, Purchaser and Seller shall (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to) submit a notification and report form pursuant to
the HSR Act relating to the transactions contemplated by this Amended
Agreement with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice as soon as practicable (and in any event no within (2)
Business Days) following such date. In addition, no party hereto shall take
any action after the date of the Original Agreement that would reasonably be
expected to delay, hinder or otherwise obstruct the consummation of the
Closing, including any action that delays the obtaining of, or results in not
obtaining, any approval, authorization, consent, clearance, order, license,
permit, qualification, exemption or waiver from any

 



70

    

 Governmental Authority or other Person required to be obtained prior to the
Closing (it being understood that this sentence shall not be deemed to expand
the obligations or modify the rights of Seller pursuant to the last sentence
of _Section_ __ _ 6.16(a)_). Notwithstanding anything in this Amended
Agreement to the contrary (i) Purchaser and Seller shall equally bear all the
costs, expenses and fees incurred or payable to any other Person in
connection with obtaining such approvals, authorizations, consents, orders,
licenses, permits, qualifications, exemptions or waivers, including filing
fees under the HSR Act and under any other applicable Review Laws (including
the cost and expense of any consultants or other non-legal outside advisors
the parties have retained in connection with any review by a Governmental
Authority related to a Review Law), and (ii) all obligations of Purchaser to
obtain the Debt Financing or any other financing for the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be governed exclusively by _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ and
not this  _Section_ __ _ 6.04_. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.04(a)_ or
in _Section_ __ _ 2.01(b)_ shall be construed to imply that Seller or any of
its Affiliates has any obligation to pay or deliver anything of value to
secure any third party consents.

(b) If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request for
information or documentary material from any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Original Agreement or this Amended Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, then such party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable
and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in
compliance with such request.

 

(c) None of the parties shall voluntarily extend any waiting period under the
HSR Act or any other applicable Review Law or enter into any agreement with
any Governmental Authority to delay or not to consummate the Acquisition
except with the prior written consent of the other parties (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

(d) Seller shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, keep
Purchaser reasonably informed about any negotiations Seller, any of its
Affiliates, or any of their respective Representative has with any Labor
Organization, such as works councils and unions regarding the implementation
of the Pre-Closing Restructuring. Seller and its Affiliates, with respect of
the Business, may not enter into any agreement with a Labor Organization
without the prior written consent of Purchaser.

 

(e) The parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby and work
cooperatively in connection with obtaining the requisite approvals,
authorizations, consents, clearances, orders, licenses, permits,
qualifications, exemptions or waivers of each applicable Governmental
Authority, including:

 

(i) cooperating with each other in connection with filings under the HSR Act
and any applicable Review Laws, any foreign investments Laws or any other
Laws;

(ii) subject to the last sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.04(e)_, furnishing
to the other party all information within its possession that is reasonably
required for any application or other filing to be made by the other party
pursuant to the HSR Act and any applicable Review Laws, any foreign investment
Laws or any other Laws in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Original Agreement and this Amended Agreement;

(iii) promptly notifying each other of any communications from or with any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by the
Original Agreement and this Amended Agreement;

 



71

    

(iv) not agreeing to participate in any meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Authority in connection with Laws unless it consults with the
other party in advance, and to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority but subject to the last sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.04(e)_,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat, in
each case, to the extent permitted by Law; and

(v) subject to the last sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.04(e)_, consulting
and cooperating with one another in connection with all analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, submissions, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection
with proceedings and Actions under or relating to the HSR Act and any
applicable Review Laws, any foreign investment Laws or any other Laws in
connection with the Transaction Documents or any of the transactions
contemplated thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to _Section_ __ _
6.04(g)(ii)_, Purchaser shall make the final determination as to the
appropriate course of action with respect to the matters contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 6.04_.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Amended Agreement shall require
Seller to disclose to Purchaser any nonpublic information about itself, any
of its Affiliates or any of its or its Affiliates respective businesses or
operations other than information relating to the Business, the Transferred
Assets, the Transferred Entities and the Overhead and Shared Services.

(f) Purchaser shall initiate or vigorously defend on the merits any Action in
order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Governmental
Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would reasonably be
expected to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit, or delay in any material
respect the consummation of the Acquisition.

(g) Without limiting or otherwise modifying in any respect Purchasers
obligations contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.04_, Purchaser and Seller
further agree that:

(i) Purchaser shall initiate a _bona fide_ sale process with respect to such
business as is required to be divested in accordance with _Section_ __ _
6.04(h)_ as promptly as practicable following issuance of a clearance
decision, or to the extent practicable promptly during the pendency of an in-
depth investigation, in each case pursuant to the EC Merger Regulation (the "
_Divestiture Process_ ").

 

(ii) With respect to any Divestiture Process, Purchaser shall (A) use good
faith efforts to seek to maximize the value received by Purchaser (taking
into account the expected timing and likelihood of consummation, and all
financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposed transaction in
the Divestiture Process, in each case as Purchasers board of
directors reasonably deems relevant), (B) to the extent not prohibited by
applicable Law, keep Seller reasonably informed on a prompt basis with respect
to the status of the Divestiture Process and any material developments
relating thereto and (C) consult with Seller with respect to the strategy
undertaken in connection with the Divestiture Process. For the avoidance of
doubt, Seller shall be entitled to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law
to participate in the Divestiture Process as a potential buyer (it being
understood that Seller shall be under no obligation to do so and the failure
of Seller to so participate or to retain the business contemplated by the
Remedy shall not limit or otherwise modify Purchasers obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.04_ in any respect); _provided_ , _however_ , that if Seller
is participating in the Divestiture Process as a potential buyer, Purchaser
shall not be required to comply with its obligations under clauses (B) and
(C) of the immediately preceding sentence. Purchaser shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Divestiture Process to be completed as soon as
practicable and prior to the Termination Date).

 



72

    

(iii) In the event that the aggregate proceeds actually received by Purchaser
as a result of the divestiture undertaken in connection with the Divestiture
Process (after giving effect to any post-closing net working capital or other
similar purchase price adjustment) are (i) greater than the European Battery
Business Target Price, then Purchaser shall promptly pay Seller within three
(3) Business Days of the final determination of the purchase price for the
divestiture undertaken in connection with the Divestiture Process an amount
equal to 25% of such excess, or (ii) less than the European Battery Business
Target Price, then Seller shall promptly pay Purchaser within three (3)
Business Days of the final determination of the purchase price for the
divestiture undertaken in connection with the Divestiture Process an amount
equal to the lesser of (A) 75% of the difference between the European Battery
Business Target Price and the amount so received in such sale, and (B)
$200,000,000.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Amended Agreement, and except
to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law, any amount paid by
Purchaser under this _Section_ __ _ 6.04(g)_ (except any amount that
constitutes imputed interest under the Code and regulations thereunder) shall
be treated as an addition to the Purchase Price paid by Purchaser for
the business contemplated by the Remedy and allocated thereto, and any amount
paid by Seller under this _Section_ __ _ 6.04(g)_ shall be treated as a
reduction of the Purchase Price paid by Purchaser for the business
contemplated by the Remedy and allocated as a reduction thereto.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Purchaser shall not be required
to take any action, including (x) conducting a Divestiture Process, (y)
implementing any Remedy or (z) entering into any consent decree, hold separate
orders or other arrangements, in each case, (I) that requires the divestiture
of any assets of any of Purchaser or Seller, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or (II) limits Purchasers or any of its Subsidiaries freedom of
action with respect to, or its or their ability to retain the Business or any
portion thereof or any of Purchasers or any of its Subsidiaries other
assets or businesses; _provided_ , _however_ , that in order to proactively
resolve as promptly as practicable any perceived competition concerns with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, following the date of this
Amended Agreement, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, in
each case to the extent necessary in order to obtain clearance, agree to:

 

(i) divest, transfer or assign, and/or to enter into distribution, supply or
licensing Contracts or other similar arrangements, and take any other
reasonable actions related thereto, in each case in respect of all or a
portion of the European Battery Business; and

(ii) enter into supply, distribution or licensing Contracts or other similar
arrangements with the European Battery Business or any such portion of it as
is divested pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.04(h)(i)_ in connection with the
Divestiture Process and/or with the buyer of any such business, and take any
other reasonable actions related thereto, in respect of hearing aid batteries
and related components, for supply by such business solely in the Non-
Audiologist Retail Channel;

_provided_ , _however_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall
not be required to divest, transfer or assign, and/or to enter into
distribution, supply or licensing Contracts or other similar arrangements, or
take other actions related thereto, Sellers and its Subsidiaries: (A)
consumer battery, chargers, and portable power and lighting business in North
America, Latin America and Asia-Pacific, or (B) other than to the extent
expressly contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 6.04(h)(ii)_, business with
respect to hearing aid batteries and related components under the Rayovac®
brand, private label or otherwise.

 

Section 6.05 _Bulk Sales_. Where permitted under applicable Law, Purchaser
hereby waives compliance by Seller and its Subsidiaries with any applicable
bulk sale or bulk transfer Laws in connection with the sale of the Business to
Purchaser and its Affiliates. Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless
Purchaser and its Affiliates against any and all claims that may be asserted
by third Persons against Purchaser or its Affiliates as a result of
noncompliance by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries with any such bulk transfer
Law.

Section 6.06 _Insurance_.

 

(a) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.06(b)_, (i) Purchaser shall not,
and shall cause its Affiliates, including the Transferred Entities after the
Closing not to, assert, by way of claim, action, litigation or otherwise, any
right to any Seller Policies or any benefit under any such Seller Policies,
and (ii) Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities)
shall retain after the Closing all right, title and interest in and to Seller
Policies, including the right to any credit or return premiums due, paid or
payable in connection with the termination thereof.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all claims and proceeds
actually paid out to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries under occurrence based
Seller Policies or under directors and officers and fiduciary liability
policies that are Seller Policies (in all cases, other than actual or de facto
self-insurance arrangements) after the Closing shall be for the benefit of
Purchaser (and Seller and its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts
to cooperate with Purchaser in the pursuit of such recoveries) to the extent
such claims and proceeds are in respect of (1) the Assumed Liabilities or (2)
the Business or the Transferred Assets, and Seller shall cause such proceeds,
net of any reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred by
Seller or its Affiliates in obtaining the proceeds, to be transferred to
Purchaser promptly after such proceeds are received by Seller; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such proceeds shall be for the benefit of, and shall be kept
by, Seller to the extent such proceeds are reimbursements (x) for
expenditures that have been made prior to the Closing by Seller or (y) to the
extent relating to insurance coverage for Retained Liabilities. After the
Closing, Purchaser may pursue insurance coverage under an occurrence based
Seller Policy or under directors and officers and fiduciary liability
policies that are Seller Policies (other than any actual or de facto self-
insurance arrangement) in respect of (1) the Assumed Liabilities or (2) the
Business or the Transferred Assets, and Purchaser may control the pursuit of
any such insurance claim. If Purchaser informs Seller in a timely manner of
such claim, then Seller shall report and pursue such claim in a manner that
is at least as favorable to the claimant as the manner in which Seller reports
and pursues claims by itself or its then-existing Subsidiaries. To the extent
Purchaser and/or its Affiliates are insureds under the Seller
Policies, Purchaser shall have the right to control the pursuit of any such
insurance claim, and Seller shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with Purchaser in Purchasers pursuit of insurance coverage under
the Seller Policies. Sellers duty to cooperate is conditioned upon
Purchasers payment of any reasonable out-of-pocket incidental costs and
expenses incurred by Seller in connection with Purchasers pursuit of
insurance claims under the Seller Policies, including the necessary and
reasonable costs and expenses of Sellers consultants, brokers and outside
counsel (collectively, " _Outside Consultants_ "). If Purchasers pursuit of
insurance coverage necessitates the use of any Outside Consultant by Seller,
Seller will promptly advise Purchaser and provide Purchaser with an
opportunity to evaluate and provide its views on the retention and reasonable
costs of such Outside Consultant. For any insurance claims or proceeds
Purchaser is entitled to under this _Section_ __ _ 6.06_, Purchaser shall be
liable for and shall reimburse Seller for all related insurance charges,
including any deductibles, allocated and unallocated claim expenses, and any
adjustments that result in the recoupment of insurance proceeds paid by the
insurer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section_ __ _
6.06(b)_, Purchaser shall bear all risk related to the unavailability of
insurance coverage, and Seller shall have no liability, including to Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates, for the inability to obtain insurance coverage for
the benefit of Purchaser.

(c) With respect to insurance coverage written on a claims made basis (other
than directors and officers and fiduciary liability policies), Seller and
its Affiliates shall have no Liability to Purchaser and its Affiliates or the
Business under such insurance coverage in connection with claims made after
the Closing and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _
11.03(a)_, Purchaser shall

 



74

    

 not be obligated to seek recovery or make any claim under any such insurance
coverage. From and after the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Entities) to, cause all rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation now existing in favor
of any present or former director or officer of the Business (an " _Employee
Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in (A) the organizational documents of
Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Entities), or (B)
agreements between an Employee Indemnified Party and Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Entities), in each case in effect at
the Closing Date, to survive the Closing and to continue in full force and
effect for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Closing Date, or,
if longer, for such period as is set forth in any applicable agreement with
an Employee Indemnified Party in effect on the date of the Original Agreement.
Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, maintain in effect the Seller
Policies providing directors and officers and fiduciary liability coverage
for the Transferred Entities for the remaining term of such policies and for
six (6) years following the Closing shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
to not, enter into any renewal or replacement thereof that would have the
effect of excluding the Employee Indemnified Parties from coverage
thereunder. Purchaser shall cause all Transferred Entities to cause all rights
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation now existing in
favor of any Employee Indemnified Party as provided in (A) the organizational
documents of the Transferred Entities, or (B) agreements between an Employee
Indemnified Party and any Transferred Entities, in each case in effect at the
Closing Date, to survive the Closing and to continue in full force and effect
for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Closing Date, or, if
longer, for such period as is set forth in any applicable agreement with an
Employee Indemnified Party in effect on the date of the Original Agreement.
The indemnification obligations of the Transferred Entities shall be primary
to any indemnification obligations of the Sellers or its Affiliates as it
relates to losses suffered by any Employee Indemnified Party.

 

(d) Purchaser shall cooperate as reasonably requested by Seller and its
Subsidiaries (at the expense of Seller) to obtain the return or release of
all bonds, security, credit support, parent guarantees, and indemnifications
given by Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than by the Transferred Entities
without any credit support from Seller and its Subsidiaries, other than the
Transferred Entities) in connection with the Business, and, if necessary to
effectuate such return or release, Purchaser shall, to the extent required,
post its own bonds, security, letters of credit, guarantees or other
collateral or provide indemnification in substitution therefor, in each case
solely to the extent provided by Seller on the date of the Original Agreement,
and only on terms and conditions equal to or more favorable than those in
existence on the date of the Original Agreement;  _provided_ , that neither
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
applicable Transferred Entities) shall be obligated to make any payments or
incur any unreasonable costs or expenses in connection with this  _Section_
__ _ 6.06(d)_.

Section 6.07 _Certain Services and Benefits Provided by Affiliates;
Intercompany Matters; Further Assurances_.

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that the Business currently receives Overhead and
Shared Services from other business units of Seller and its Subsidiaries.
Purchaser further acknowledges that, except as otherwise expressly provided in
the Transition Services Agreement, all such Overhead and Shared Services shall
cease, and any agreement with Seller or any Affiliate of Seller in respect
thereof shall terminate, as of the Closing Date. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in the Transition Services Agreement, following the Closing Date,
Purchaser and Seller shall in good faith determine a mutually acceptable
subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangement under which Purchaser
would, in compliance with Law, obtain the benefits under, and, to the extent
first arising after the Closing, assume the obligations and bear the
economic burdens associated with, the portion of any Shared Contract that is
an Excluded Contract relating to the Business, and Seller would, in compliance
with Law, obtain the benefits under, and, to the extent first arising after
the Closing, assume the obligations and bear the economic burdens associated
with, the portion of any Shared Contract that is a Transferred Contract not

 



75

    

 relating to the Business. Each party shall, upon the reasonable written
request from the other party, use reasonable efforts to enforce for the
benefit of the other party (at such other partys sole cost and expense) all
rights against any third party under such Shared Contract to the extent such
rights arise under the portion of the Shared Contract relating to the other
partys business, and, as applicable, promptly pay to the other party when
received all monies received by them under such Shared Contract. Each of
Purchaser and Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the other party and its
Affiliates against any and all Losses incurred, suffered or sustained by such
party or its Affiliates or asserted against such party or its Affiliates as a
result of any action taken by such first party or any of its Affiliates under
or with respect to any Shared Contract that such first party or any of its
Affiliates obtains the benefits under pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.07(a)_.

(b) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Amended Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements, Purchaser and Seller agree and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries or, in the case of Purchaser, its Affiliates, to agree
(and Purchaser shall cause the Transferred Entities to agree) that, from and
after the Closing, all rights and obligations of any party under all Contracts
between Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Entities and
the Business), on the one hand, and the Transferred Entities and the Business,
on the other hand, (including all intercompany receivables and payables
between such entities) shall terminate and be cancelled without any further
Liability, including Liability relating to any period prior to the Closing.
For the avoidance of doubt, immediately prior to the Closing, Seller shall
cause any Indebtedness owing from any of the Transferred Entities to Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Entities) to be discharged
or released without any Liability to Purchaser, the Business or any
Transferred Entity. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall be not be
required to terminate any intercompany Contracts (including any such Contracts
with respect to Indebtedness) to which the only parties thereto
are Transferred Entities in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Amended Agreement.

(c) Each of the parties shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
(including, in the case of Purchaser from and after the Closing, the
Transferred Entities) to execute and deliver such documents and other papers
and take such further actions as may reasonably be required to carry out the
provisions of this Amended Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and give
effect to the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the
execution and delivery of such assignments, deeds and other documents as may
be necessary to transfer any Transferred Assets or Battery Companies Equity
Interests as provided in this Amended Agreement and any items identified as a
closing deliverable in any Foreign Acquisition Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, the parties shall prepare, execute and deliver whatever reasonable
supplemental agreements, instruments or other documentation is necessary to
consummate the transfer of the Battery Companies Equity Interests in
accordance with the applicable Laws of the jurisdictions under which the
Transferred Entities are organized and on and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Amended Agreement; _provided_ that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in such agreements, instruments and documentation,
nothing in such agreements, instruments and documentation shall supersede or
otherwise amend or modify the rights and obligations provided for in this
Amended Agreement and, in the event of any conflict or alleged conflict
between such agreements, instruments and documentation, on the one hand, and
this Amended Agreement, on the other hand, the terms and conditions of this
Amended Agreement (including _Article XI_ ) shall prevail. Without limiting
the foregoing, from and after the Closing (i) Seller shall (and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to) do all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law as reasonably requested by Purchaser (A) to put Purchaser in
actual possession, ownership and control of the Transferred Assets and
Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller for such purpose and (B) to assure that
Seller and its Subsidiaries, rather than Purchaser or any of its Affiliates,
are the obligors in respect of all Retained Liabilities and (ii) Purchaser
shall do all things necessary, proper and advisable under applicable Law as
reasonably requested by Seller (A) (at Sellers expense) to transfer to Seller
(or such other Person as Seller shall indicate) any Excluded Assets that
Purchaser, any Transferred Entity or any of their respective Affiliates may
possess (other than,

 



76

    

 for the avoidance of doubt, any Cash and Cash Equivalents in the
jurisdictions set forth on _Section_ __ _ 1.01(m)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter that are above the applicable cap, if any), (B) to assure that
Purchaser, rather than Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, is the obligor in
respect of all Assumed Liabilities, and Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser
for such purposes and (C) except as otherwise provided in this _Section_ __ _
6.07(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.08_, to cease the use or deployment by the
Business of those names and Trademarks that do not constitute Transferred
Assets as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.07(c)(ii)(C)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter (" _Retained Trademarks_ "). Purchaser shall, upon the
request of Seller, and at no cost to Seller (other than reimbursement of out-
of-pocket expenses), make the Transferred Employees available at reasonable
times and cooperate in all reasonable respects with Seller and its
Subsidiaries in the preparation for, and defense of, any lawsuit, arbitration
or other Action (whether disclosed or not disclosed in the Seller Disclosure
Letter) filed or claimed against Seller or any of its Affiliates or any of the
respective agents, directors, officers and employees of Seller and its
Affiliates, whether currently pending or asserted in the future, concerning
the operation or conduct of the Business prior to the Closing Date (including
in each case by making Transferred Employees available at reasonable times to
provide information and discovery documentation, take depositions and
testify). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall (i)
for a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date or one (1) year after
the last Local Agency Agreement terminates, whichever period is the last to
expire (the " _Sell-Through Period_ "), (x) have the right to use any signs,
billboards, advertisements, vehicle and equipment markings, stationary,
letterhead, sales literature, invoices, purchase orders, forms, business cards
and other media, including respective online material, bearing or
incorporating any the Retained Trademarks, and (y) have the right to use
any containers, displays, product tags, labels, packaging or other similar
materials bearing or incorporating the Retained Trademarks, in each case of
(x) and (y), whether such materials exist at Closing or are created within the
Sell-Through Period, until the exhaustion of such materials and (ii) within a
period of thirty (30) days after the last Local Agency Agreement terminates,
change all corporate names incorporating any of the Retained Trademarks; and,
for the avoidance of doubt, at the end of the foregoing time-periods,
Purchaser and its Affiliate shall cease the sale, distribution or use of any
such products, materials or names bearing or incorporating any of the Retained
Trademarks (except as expressly permitted under this Amended Agreement). For
the avoidance of doubt, Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for so long as any Local Agency
Agreement (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement) is in effect,
nothing shall prohibit Seller, Purchaser, or any of their respective
Affiliates from complying with the terms thereof and such compliance shall be
deemed not to be a breach of any provision of this Amended Agreement. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing sentence, the time periods
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.07(c)_ shall be deemed to be automatically
extended as necessary to permit continued operations pursuant to the Local
Agency Agreements. 

Section 6.08 _Other Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, and excluding any Trademarks, with
respect to any Intellectual Property included in the Excluded Assets owned or
licensed (to the extent that such Intellectual Property can be sublicensed on
the terms herein without any consent, payment or other consideration and
without any relinquishment or forbearance of any rights, and, in any event,
excluding any Software or Intellectual Property used for Overhead and Shared
Services) by Seller and its Affiliates as of the Closing Date that is used,
held for use by or necessary to the operation of the Business as of the
Closing Date (including with respect to products in development), Seller does
hereby, and shall cause its Affiliates to, grant Purchaser in and to such
Intellectual Property a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive,
royalty-free license to use, reproduce, publish, display, perform, make, have
made, sell, offer, import or otherwise exploit, solely in connection with the
Business, any product, process, work or service.

 



77

    

(b) _Section_ __ _ 6.08_ shall not obligate Seller and its Affiliates
to deliver any further information or tangible materials to Purchaser beyond
that set forth elsewhere in this Amended Agreement. Each party shall use its
reasonable efforts to maintain any trade secrets or other confidential
information contained within such information or materials as confidential,
including refraining from disclosing such trade secrets or confidential
information to any other Person other than pursuant to reasonable
confidentiality terms.

 

(c) Purchaser may sublicense the rights contained within _Section_ __ _
6.08(a)_ without prior written consent only in a manner consistent with how
Purchaser sublicenses its own comparable Intellectual Property including by
the inclusion of reasonable confidentiality terms.

 

(d) Purchaser may not assign the rights contained within _Section_ __ _
6.08(a)_ without the prior written consent of Seller, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , that Purchaser may
assign such rights in whole or in part without the prior written consent of
Seller (i) in connection with any merger, public offering, consolidation,
reorganization, or sale of substantially all of the assets or any divisions,
businesses, operating units or portion of Purchaser or (ii) to Purchasers
Affiliates.

 

(e) For the period commencing upon the Closing Date and ending upon the date
that is thirty-six (36) months after the Closing Date, in the event that
Purchaser or any Transferred Entity (i) becomes aware that Purchaser or such
Transferred Entity does not have in its possession certain technical
schematics, designs, manuals, records and other documentation owned by Seller
or its Affiliates and used in the operation of the Business or the operations
of Sellers or its Affiliates businesses as of the Closing Date (in each
case, including with respect to products or services in development) ("
_Materials_ ") and (ii) has a reasonable belief that Seller or its Affiliates
may have such Materials in their possession, then, upon Purchasers request,
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make copies of such
Materials available to Purchaser and the Transferred Entities for their use in
connection with the Business without any further consideration owed in
connection therewith.

 

(f) Seller and its Subsidiaries shall not at any time after the Closing Date
(i) oppose, seek cancellation of, object to, challenge the strength, validity
or enforceability of, or otherwise attack Purchasers or any of the
Transferred Entities ownership, application, or registration of, or (ii)
oppose, object to, challenge, or otherwise attack Purchasers or any of the
Transferred Entities or any of its or their respective customers,
resellers, suppliers, or licensees use of, in each of subsections (i) and
(ii) of this _Section_ __ _ 6.08(f)_, any Acquired Intellectual Property;
_provided_ , that, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.08(f)_ shall prevent
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries from complying with any order issued by a
Governmental Authority, defending itself, its products or others in any
Action, or enforcing this Amended Agreement.

(g) On or prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the actions set forth on
_Section_ __ _ 6.08(g)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter to be taken.

Section 6.09 _Ancillary Agreements; Identified Sublease._

(a) Seller and Purchaser shall enter into the Transition Services Agreement on
the Closing Date as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 6.09(b)_. In connection
with the foregoing, the parties will cooperate in good faith to finalize the
scope and other terms of the services to be provided by Seller or Purchaser,
as applicable, pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement (which such
cooperation shall include, to the extent reasonably requested by the other
party, making appropriate personnel available to participate in meetings and
other discussions relating to the foregoing).

 



78

    

(b) On the Closing Date, each of Purchaser and Seller shall (or, if
applicable, each shall cause its Subsidiaries or, in the case of Purchaser,
its designated Affiliates to) execute and deliver each of the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party if such Ancillary Agreement has not been
previously executed.

 

(c) Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents or
approvals under the lease agreement for the Leased Real Property identified
on _Section_ __ _ 4.08(a)(1)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the "
_Identified Lease_ ") that are required to enable Purchaser and Seller to
enter into a sublease agreement with respect to the Identified Lease
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit_ __ _ F_ (the "
_Identified Sublease_ "). Subject to and upon receipt of any such required
consents or approvals, Purchaser and Seller shall enter into the Identified
Sublease on the Closing Date.

Section 6.10 _Maintenance of Books and Records; Cooperation_. After the
Closing, each of the parties hereto shall preserve, until at least the fifth
(5th) anniversary of the Closing Date or such longer time as may be required
by applicable Law, all pre-Closing records (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any loss run information with respect to Seller Policies, any
information or statutory records, including in relation to the Pre-Closing
Restructuring and any updates thereto) possessed or to be possessed by such
party to the extent relating to the Business, the Transferred Assets or the
Overhead and Shared Services. After the Closing Date and up until at least
the fifth (5 _th_ ) anniversary of the Closing Date or such longer time as may
be required by applicable Law, upon any reasonable request from a party hereto
or its Representatives, the party holding such portion of the records
relating to the Business, the Transferred Assets or the Subsidiaries that
owned the Transferred Assets prior to the Pre-Closing Restructuring or prior
to the Closing shall (a) provide to the requesting party or its
Representatives reasonable access to such portion of the records relating to
the Business during normal business hours and (b) permit the requesting party
or its Representatives to make copies of such records, in each case at no
cost to the requesting party or its Representatives (other than for reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall
require either party to take any action or provide any access pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.10_ if doing so would (i) reasonably be likely to
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or other legal privilege, or (ii)
contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement (including
any confidentiality agreement to which Seller or any of its Affiliates is a
party) (it being understood that Seller shall cooperate in any reasonable
efforts and requests for waivers that would enable otherwise required
disclosure to Purchaser to occur without so jeopardizing privilege or
contravening such Law, duty or agreement). Such records may be sought under
this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ __ for any reasonable purpose in connection with
any matter relating to or affected by the operations or tax reporting of the
Business, including to the extent reasonably required in connection with the
audit, accounting, financial reporting, tax, litigation, federal, foreign, or
state securities disclosure or other similar needs of the party seeking such
records. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any and all such records may be
destroyed by a party if such destroying party sends to the other party hereto
written notice of its intent to destroy such records, specifying in reasonable
detail the contents of the records to be destroyed; such records may then
be destroyed after the sixtieth (60 _th_ ) day following such notice unless
the other party hereto notifies the destroying party that such other party
desires to obtain possession of such records, in which event the destroying
party shall, prior to destroying such records, give the requesting party a
reasonable opportunity, at the requesting partys expense, to segregate and
transfer the records. In addition, following the Closing, each party agrees
to provide and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to provide, such cooperation and assistance to the other
party, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, such partys auditors), as may be reasonably
requested by such other party upon reasonable advance written notice, in
connection with the audit, accounting, financial reporting, tax, litigation,
federal, foreign or state securities disclosure or other similar needs of
such requesting party; _provided_ , that such cooperation and assistance shall
be provided at the requesting partys expense.

 



79

    

Section 6.11 _Endorsement of Checks_. Seller hereby authorizes Purchaser
following the Closing to endorse for deposit only its name on and collect for
Purchasers account any checks received in payment of any Accounts Receivable
included in the Transferred Assets, and any refunds of deposits, prepaid
expenses and similar amounts included in the Transferred Assets.

Section 6.12 _Financing_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or
any waiver of any provision or remedy under, or replace, the Debt Financing
Commitment and/or the Escrow Indenture Documents, without the prior written
consent of Seller, if such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement (i)
(A) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing
the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount) to an amount that is
below an amount that, assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties contained in _Article III_ and _Article IV_ , is sufficient
to complete the transactions contemplated by this Amended Agreement and pay
all fees and amounts in connection with this Amended Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (B) imposes
new or additional conditions or otherwise adversely expands, amends or
modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, or (C)
otherwise expand, amend or modify any provision of the Debt Financing
Commitment and/or the Escrow Indenture Documents, in the case of this
_clause_ __ _ (C)_, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (I)
materially delay or prevent the Closing, (II) adversely impact in any material
respect the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights under the Debt
Financing Commitment or the definitive agreements with respect thereto and/or
the Escrow Indenture Documents or (III) materially delay or impair the
availability of the Debt Financing at the Closing or materially impede the
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing at the Closing
(including release of the proceeds of the Escrow Notes from escrow) (clauses
(A), (B) and (C), collectively, the " _Restricted Financing Commitment
Amendments_ ") ( _provided_ that, subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.12_, Purchaser may amend the Debt Financing Commitment (1)
to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities who had not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date
hereof, but only if the addition of such additional parties, individually or
in the aggregate, would not result in the occurrence of a Restricted
Financing Commitment Amendment, or (2) in connection with an alternative
financing as contemplated by _clause_ __ _ (b)_ of this _Section_ __ _
6.12_) or (ii) results in the early termination of the Debt Financing
Commitment.

(b) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitment and the
Escrow Indenture Documents, including using its reasonable best efforts to
(i) maintain in effect the Debt Financing Commitment (including by complying
with so-called "flex" provisions) until the funding of the Debt Financing at
or prior to the Closing, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain a waiver
of) all conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing at the Closing as set forth
in the Debt Financing Commitment and the Escrow Indenture Documents
(other than those that are solely within the control of Seller and its
Subsidiaries) and comply with all of its material obligations thereunder,
(iii) negotiate, execute and deliver definitive agreements (which with respect
to any bridge facility documentation shall not be required until reasonably
necessary in connection with the funding of the Debt Financing) with respect
to such Debt Financing on the terms and conditions (including the "flex"
provisions) contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment and the Escrow
Indenture Documents (and provide executed copies of such definitive agreements
to Seller) or on other terms in the aggregate materially no less favorable to
Purchaser or the interests of Seller, as to conditionality, than the terms
and conditions in the Debt Financing Commitment and the Escrow Indenture
Documents, as applicable (provided that in no event shall any such definitive
agreement contain terms (other than those included in the Debt Financing
Commitment and the Escrow Indenture Documents) that would constitute
Restricted Financing

 



80

    

 Commitment Amendments), (iv) fully pay any and all commitment fees or other
fees required by the Debt Financing Commitment, and (v) upon satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment and the Escrow
Indenture Documents, consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing
and enforce its rights under the Debt Financing Commitment and the Escrow
Indenture Documents. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions)
contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment and the Escrow Indenture
Documents, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources for such portion on terms and
conditions (x) not materially less favorable to Purchaser than the Debt
Financing Commitment and the Escrow Indenture Documents, (y) with conditions
to the funding of the Debt Financing not materially less favorable to the
interests of Seller than those included in the Debt Financing Commitment and
the Escrow Indenture Documents, and (z) in an amount sufficient to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the payment of the Estimated

all related fees and expenses promptly following the occurrence of such event,

shall promptly deliver to Seller true and complete copies of a new financing
commitment pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed
to provide Purchaser with any portion of the Debt Financing. Purchaser shall
keep Seller reasonably informed and in reasonable detail with respect to all
material developments concerning the Debt Financing, including advising and
updating Seller, in a reasonable level of detail, with respect to status and
proposed closing date of the Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller in writing of (1) any
breach or default by any party to the Debt Financing Commitment or the Escrow
Indenture Documents of which Purchaser has become aware, which breach
or default if not cured could reasonably be expected to result in the
unavailability of the Debt Financing or any termination of any of the Debt
Financing Commitment or the Escrow Indenture Documents, (2) of the receipt by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or their respective employees, agents or
representatives of any notice or other communication from any Person with

Indenture Documents or any definitive agreement related thereto or (II)
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Debt
Financing Commitment, the Escrow Indenture Documents or any
definitive agreement related thereto, in each case which could reasonably be
expected to result in the unavailability of the Debt Financing or any
termination of any of the Debt Financing Commitment or the Escrow Indenture
Documents, and (3) if for any reason Purchaser believes in good faith that
(I) there is (or there is reasonably likely to be) a material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Financing Commitment,
the Escrow Indenture Documents or any definitive agreement related thereto
which could reasonably be expected to result in the unavailability of the Debt
Financing or any termination of any of the Debt Financing Commitment or the
Escrow Indenture Documents or (II) there is a material possibility that it
will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the financing contemplated in
the Debt Financing Commitment and the Escrow Indenture Documents on the terms,
in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment, the Escrow Indenture Documents or the definitive
agreements related thereto. References in this Amended Agreement to "Debt

the Business as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser in writing, and in
any case, solely to the extent necessary to permit Purchaser to prepare a
bank information memoranda or similar document, to consummate the Debt
Financing, (ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations, bank information memoranda and similar documents required in
connection with the Debt Financing, (iii) before the Closing and, to the

prior to the anticipated Closing Date; provided, however, that Seller, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall not be required to
authorize, execute, deliver or perform under any agreement with respect to the
Debt Financing that (A) unreasonably interferes with the ongoing business of
Seller or its Subsidiaries; (B) causes any covenant, representation or
warranty in this Amended Agreement to be breached in a manner that would cause
any closing condition to Purchasers obligations to fail to be satisfied or
otherwise causes the breach of this Amended Agreement (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing); (C)
requires Seller or its Subsidiaries to incur any liability (including,
without limitation, any commitment fees and expense reimbursement) in
connection with the Debt Financing, other than solely in the case of the
Transferred Entities, any liability that is contingent upon the occurrence
of the Closing or that would be effective only on and after the Closing; (D)
requires Seller or its Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers,

its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar
fees or make any

 



82

    

 other out-of-pocket payment or incur any other liability or obligation or
provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Debt
Financing or any of the foregoing in connection with the Debt Financing in
connection with assisting Purchaser in arranging the Debt Financing or as a
result of any information provided by Seller, its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Affiliates or Representatives in connection with the Debt
Financing. Seller, on behalf of the Business, hereby consents to the use of
the Business logos in connection with the Debt Financing contemplated by the
Debt Financing Commitment; provided, that such logos are used solely in a
manner that is not intended to, nor reasonably likely to, harm or disparage
the Business, Seller or its Subsidiaries. Purchaser agrees that any
information regarding Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
contained in any presentations, offering documents, teasers or other materials
in connection with, or related to, the Debt Financing shall be subject to the
prior review of Seller, which review shall be completed promptly after
receipt thereof.

(d) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates, their
respective Subsidiaries and the Representatives of each of the foregoing (the
" _Financing Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, awards, judgments, fines, interest, and
penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of
the Debt Financing (including any replacement or alternative financing) and
the performance of their respective obligations under this _Section_ __ _
6.12_ or any information utilized in connection therewith (other than
directly arising from a material misstatement in, or material omission in, the
information, taken as a whole, provided by or on behalf of the Seller,
specifically for use in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing), in each case other than to the extent any of the foregoing arises
from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller or its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates and Representatives.
Purchaser shall, promptly from time to time, and any in any case, within
three (3) Business Days of written request therefor, advance or reimburse (as
requested in writing) Seller and its Subsidiaries for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including external legal costs
and expenses and costs and expenses of their respective Representatives) that
have been incurred by Seller, its Affiliates and their respective
Subsidiaries (including those of their respective Representatives) in
connection with cooperation under _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ and/or in the
preparation or cooperation with respect to the preparation of the financial
statements for use by the Purchaser in any of its public filings, including
the notes thereto, or any audit or review of such financial statements by
independent accountants (which for avoidance of doubt, shall include those
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 6.17_). This _Section_ __ _ 6.12(d)_ shall
survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, and any
termination of this Amended Agreement, and is intended to benefit, and may be
enforced by, the Financing Indemnitees and their respective heirs, executors,
estates, personal Representatives, successors and assigns who are each third
party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 6.12(d)_. 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Amended
Agreement, nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ shall require,
and in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Purchaser be deemed or
construed to require, Purchaser to (i) to pay any fees in excess of those
contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment (whether to secure waiver or
any conditions contained therein or otherwise), (ii) amend or waive any of the
terms or conditions hereof or (iii) consummate the Closing at any time prior
to the date determined in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.05(a)_.

(f) [Reserved].

 

(g) Prior to the Closing, if reasonably requested by Purchaser, Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
auditors that have audited the Businesss audited financial statements to
permit the filing of such financial statements (and corresponding reports)
with the SEC if so required in connection with a registration statement.

 



83

    

Section 6.13 _Certain Covenants_.

 

(a) As consideration for and to induce Purchaser to pay the consideration set
forth in this Amended Agreement, during the Restricted Period, Seller shall,
and Seller shall cause each other Restricted Party not to, directly or
indirectly, engage in any Restricted Activities; _provided_ , that nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ shall prohibit any Restricted Party from acquiring
(by asset purchase, stock purchase, merger or consolidation) a business that
engages in Restricted Activities (such business, an " _Acquired Competitive
Business_ ") and thereafter engaging in, or owning, operating, controlling,
managing, financing or participating in, or attempting to do any of the
foregoing, with respect to such Acquired Competitive Business, if:

 

(i) such Acquired Competitive Business generated less than either (A) five
percent (5%) of the net revenues of the combined businesses that are being
acquired as part of the same transaction or related transactions in which such
Acquired Competitive Business is being acquired (measured for the last twelve
(12) months for which such financial data are available prior to
the execution of the definitive agreement for such acquisition (or the date
of the consummation of such acquisition if there is no such definitive
agreement)), or (B) $15,000,000 in net revenues (measured for the last twelve
(12) months for which such financial data are available prior to the
execution of the definitive agreement for such acquisition (or the date of the
consummation of such acquisition if there is no such definitive agreement));
and

 

(ii) Seller shall, only in the event that neither the condition in _clause_ __
_ (a)_ _(i)(A)_ nor the condition in  _clause_ __ _ (a)_ _(i)(B)_ of this
proviso were satisfied, promptly pursue and thereafter engage in one or more
transactions that result in the sale, in a commercially reasonable manner,
(or, at Sellers election in its sole discretion, shut down) of such Acquired
Competitive Business to the extent necessary so that the remaining Acquired
Competitive Business would have satisfied either the condition in _clause_ __
_ (a)_ _(i)(A)_ or the condition in _clause_ __ _ (a)_ _(i)(B)_ of this
proviso (for the avoidance of doubt the denominator to be used for purposes of
measuring the condition in _clause_ __ _ (a)_ _(i)(A)_ pursuant to this 
_subparagraph_ __ _ (a_ _)_ _(ii)_ shall be the same denominator used in
_subparagraph_ __ _ (a_ _)_ _(i)_ ).

 

Seller represents, stipulates and acknowledges on behalf of itself and the
other Restricted Parties that: (x) the restrictive covenants contained in
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.13(a)_ are a material inducement to Purchaser to
enter into the Original Agreement and this Amended Agreement and consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby for which the Restricted Parties will
receive a substantial financial benefit, and (y) it would impair the goodwill
acquired by Purchaser and reduce the value of the Business obtained by
Purchaser through the transactions contemplated hereby if such Restricted
Party were to use its ability and knowledge in competition with Purchaser,
its Affiliates or the Business, or to otherwise breach the obligations
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.13(a)_.

 

(b) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending two (2) years
following the Closing Date, each of Seller and Purchaser shall not, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries and Controlled Affiliates not to, directly
or indirectly:

(i) contact, solicit or assist in the solicitation of, employ or retain any
individual who is on the Closing Date an employee of the Business or an
employee of Seller, as applicable, unless such individual is (A) no longer in
the employ of the Business or Seller, as applicable, or (B) contacted or
solicited through general non-targeted solicitation or advertisement in a
newspaper, online or through an employment agency; or

 

(ii) contact, solicit, assist in the solicitation of, or cause any supplier,
customer, licensee or service provider with whom the Business or Seller, as
applicable, has a commercial relationship, whether by contract or otherwise,
in each case with the intent to reduce, discontinue or alter in a manner
adverse to the Business or Seller, as applicable, such commercial
relationship.

 



84

    

(c) Each of Seller and Purchaser has carefully read this  _Section_ __ _
6.13_ and considered the restraints imposed upon it and their respective
Subsidiaries and Controlled Affiliates and is in full accord as to the
necessity of such restrictive covenants for the reasonable and
proper protection of Purchaser, its Affiliates and the Business, or Seller
and its Affiliates, as applicable, and agrees that each commitment and
restraint imposed by the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ is fair and
reasonable with respect to subject matter, geographic scope and time period.
It is expressly understood and agreed that although Seller and Purchaser
consider such covenants to be fair and reasonable, if a judicial determination
is made by a court of competent jurisdiction that the time or any other
restriction contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ is an invalid or
unenforceable restriction against Seller, Purchaser or their respective
Subsidiaries and Controlled Affiliates, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
6.13_ shall not be rendered void but shall be deemed amended to apply to such
maximum time and to such maximum extent as such court may judicially determine
or indicate to be enforceable. Alternatively, if any court of competent
jurisdiction finds that any restriction contained in this Amended Agreement is
invalid or unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make
it enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of
the other restrictions contained herein, which shall be given full force and
effect without regard to such finding.

 

(d) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending three (3)
years following the Closing Date, each of Seller and Purchaser shall not, and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Controlled Affiliates not to,
disparage, in any form or fashion, including over any electronic or social
media, any Purchaser Indemnified Person (including Purchasers
existing business or products) or Seller Indemnified Person (including
Sellers existing business or products), as applicable, or otherwise take any
action or make any statement which could reasonably be expected adversely to
affect the reputation of, or cause any third Person to lower its perception
of the quality or integrity of, as applicable, Purchaser, Seller, their
businesses or their products (in the case of Purchaser following the Closing,
including the Business and the Products).

 

(e) Each of Seller and Purchaser acknowledges that it has informed each of
their respective Subsidiaries, Controlled Affiliates and Representatives of
the restrictive covenants contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_, to the
extent applicable, and has directed each such Person to comply with all of the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_, to the extent applicable. Each of
Seller and Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Purchaser Indemnified Persons, or Seller Indemnified Persons, as applicable,
from and against any and all Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by any of
them arising out of or in connection with any non-compliance by any of their
respective Subsidiaries and Controlled Affiliates or Representative with the
applicable provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.13_.

Section 6.14 _Pre-Closing Restructuring_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.05(b)_, to the extent not already completed
between the date of the Original Agreement and the date of this Amended
Agreement, prior to the consummation of the Closing Seller shall, and shall
cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, engage in restructuring activities
necessary to effect a reorganization of certain assets, liabilities and legal
entities to separate the Business from Sellers other businesses
(collectively, the " _Pre-Closing Restructuring_"), which such Pre-
Closing Restructuring shall be undertaken in a manner consistent with
_Section_ __ _ 6.14_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter (as the same may be
modified in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_) and otherwise in
a manner, and pursuant to documentation, reasonably acceptable to Purchaser
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and in
accordance with applicable Law. Following the Pre-Closing Restructuring, at
the Closing, Purchaser shall (directly or indirectly) own and assume all the
assets,

 



85

    

 properties, claims, rights and Liabilities of Seller and its Subsidiaries
constituting Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities and neither Purchaser
nor any of its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities) shall
(directly or indirectly) own any Excluded Assets or be liable for or have any
responsibility with respect to any Retained Liabilities.

 

(b) Seller may propose changes to _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter and  _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ (including in order to designate
any additional Subsidiaries as a Transferred Entity (whether as a Battery
Company or as a Battery Company Subsidiary) or to remove any Subsidiary from
the universe of Battery Companies or Transferred Entities) at any time prior
to the Closing and Purchaser shall consider any such proposal in good faith
and shall not unreasonably object to, delay or condition its consent to such
proposed changes. Any such agreed changes shall be incorporated into a
revised, amended and restated _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter or _Exhibit_ __ _ A_, as applicable.

 

(c) In connection with the Pre-Closing Restructuring, Seller shall, and shall
cause its applicable Subsidiaries to (i) deliver all agreements, instruments,
certificates and all other documents to effect the Pre-Closing Restructuring
to Purchaser (with appropriate redaction for confidential
information relating to Sellers other businesses or third-parties) and (ii)
keep Purchaser reasonably informed with respect to all material activity
concerning the status of the Pre-Closing Restructuring and consult with
Purchaser on a regular basis and cooperate in good faith in connection with
all of Purchasers reasonable requests for information related to the Pre-
Closing Restructuring. In the event that, at any time between the date of
this Amended Agreement and the Closing, _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ is amended to
designate any additional Subsidiaries as a Transferred Entity (whether as a
Battery Company or as a Battery Company Subsidiary) or to remove any
Subsidiary from the universe of Battery Companies or Transferred Entities,
Seller shall be permitted to revise the Seller Disclosure Letter at such time
to include any additional necessary disclosures related thereto. In
addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that (x) nothing in any agreements or instruments
entered into by Seller or its Affiliates with each other or Third Parties in
connection with the Pre-Closing Restructuring, express or implied, is intended
to or shall be construed to replace, substitute, modify, expand, qualify or
limit in any way the terms of this Amended Agreement and (y) to the
extent that any provision of any such agreements or instruments conflict or
is inconsistent with the terms of this Amended Agreement (whether or not such
agreement or instrument is stated to be subject to the terms of this Amended
Agreement), this Amended Agreement will govern.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt but subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.05(b)_, the
Pre-Closing Restructuring shall be completed by Seller or its applicable
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing.

 

(e) At or prior to the Closing, Seller will deliver to Purchaser all
agreements, instruments, certificates and other documents necessary
to evidence the release of all Liens, guarantees or other encumbrances
against the Transferred Entities and Transferred Assets with respect to the
Credit Agreement, dated June 23, 2015, as amended, with Spectrum Brands Inc.
as the Borrower and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch as administrative agent
and collateral agent.

Section 6.15 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the period following
the date of the Original Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date and
the termination of this Amended Agreement pursuant to its terms, each of
Seller and Purchaser shall give prompt notice to the other party
upon receiving Knowledge of (a) any notices, complaints, investigations or
hearings (or communications indicating that the same may be contemplated) of
any Governmental Authorities with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements, (b) any written notices or other
written communications from any third Persons alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be required with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements, (c) the institution of
any material Action involving Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or Purchaser
or any of its Subsidiaries that

 



86

    

 relates, in each case, to the transactions contemplated by this Amended
Agreement, or (d) any material event, development, or occurrence that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to a failure of a condition precedent set
forth in _Article IX_ or that would otherwise reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Amended Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that without prejudice
to Purchasers rights under _Article XI_ , no such notification or failure to
make such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements of the parties herein or the conditions to the obligations of
the parties hereunder or constitute, in and of itself, a breach giving rise to
the failure of a condition to the Closing set forth in _Article IX_. For
informational purposes only, upon Purchasers reasonable request, Seller
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to supplement or amend in
writing the Seller Disclosure Letter with respect to any matter, event,
circumstance or condition which was required (or, if occurring before,
or existing and known at, the date of the Original Agreement, would have been
required) to be set forth or described on Sections _ 4.04_, _4.05_ , _4.08_ ,
_4.11_ , _4.17_ and _4.20_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter. For clarity,
neither any such supplemental or amended disclosure, nor any failure by Seller
to make any such supplement or amendment if Seller has used its commercially
reasonable efforts to do so, will be taken into account for any purpose
under  _Article IX_ (including for purposes of determining the existence or
occurrence of a breach pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)_ and determining
the amount of Losses arising out of or resulting therefrom) or for purposes
of determining whether or not the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
9.02_ have been satisfied.

Section 6.16  _Exclusivity_.

(a) During the period following the date of the Original Agreement until the
earlier of the Closing Date and the termination of this Amended Agreement
pursuant to its terms, Seller shall not, shall cause its Subsidiaries not, and
shall direct its other Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives
not, directly or indirectly, to: (i) encourage, facilitate, initiate, solicit
or make any proposal or offer with respect to or enter into a merger,
acquisition, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, equity
investment or similar transaction involving the Business, or, other than as
expressly permitted by _Section_ __ _ 6.01(b)(v)_, any purchase of all or a
substantial portion of the assets of the Business (each, a " _Proposal_ ")
with any Person other than Purchaser; or (ii) other than informing Persons of
the existence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.16_, or communicating that such Person
is not permitted to engage in such activity at such time, engage in any
negotiations concerning, or provide any information or data concerning the
Business to, or have any discussions with, any Person other than Purchaser
that has made a Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to
the contrary herein, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.16_ shall restrict
Seller from, subject to compliance with the Confidentiality Agreement,
discussing, negotiating, providing information in connection with, entering
into any agreement providing for, consummating or otherwise taking any action
in connection with a merger, tender offer, sale, business combination
transaction or other similar transaction so long as such transaction would not
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or make more unlikely to
occur the consummation of the Acquisition; it being agreed that any
transaction described in this sentence or proposal or offer with respect
thereto shall not constitute a Proposal.

 

(b) Seller shall notify Purchaser orally and in writing promptly (but in any
event no later than twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt by Seller, its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Representatives of any
Proposal from any Person other than Purchaser. Such notice shall indicate the
identity of the Person making the Proposal and copies of any written Proposals
or amendments and supplements thereto. Seller shall keep Purchaser informed,
on a current basis (but in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours), of
any material changes in the status and any material changes or modifications
in the material terms of any such Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller shall not be required to take any action that would violate any
existing confidentiality agreement.

 



87

    

(c) Seller shall, and shall direct its Affiliates and Subsidiaries, and each
of their respective Representatives to, immediately terminate all discussions
or negotiations with all Persons other than Purchaser who have made Proposals
that are currently ongoing and shall promptly request the prompt return or
destruction of any confidential information provided to (and terminate the
VDR access of) such Person in connection with such Persons consideration of a
possible Proposal.

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

Section 7.01 _Offers of Employment_.

 

(a) Not later than seventy (70) days prior to the anticipated Closing Date as
reasonably agreed by the parties (the " _Anticipated Closing Date_ "), Seller
shall provide Purchaser updates to _Section_ __ _ 1.01(a)(ii)_ and _Section_
__ _ 1.01(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter setting forth in a non-
anonymized fashion the then-current Business Employees and Deferred Transfer
Employees. Purchaser and Seller may mutually agree to revise _Section_ __ _
1.01(a)(ii)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 1.01(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter
within five (5) days of receipt of such updated lists. Not later than ten (10)
days following Purchasers receipt of such updated lists, Purchaser shall,
or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, offer employment to each Business
Employee listed on the then-current _Section_ __ _ 1.01(a)(ii)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, with the exception of any Automatic Transfer Employees and
any Employees who are employed by a Transferred Entity (the " _Offer
Employees_ "). All offers of employment will be contingent upon execution of
Purchasers customary assignment of inventions, work made for hire, non-
disclosure, non-solicitation and non-competition agreements. Any offers of
employment made to Offer Employees who are anticipated to be Actively at Work
on the Closing Date shall provide for employment with Purchaser or an
Affiliate of Purchaser to commence effective as of 12:00 A.M., local time, on
the Closing Date. Any offer of employment made to an Offer Employee who is
not anticipated to be Actively at Work on the Closing Date (an " _Inactive
Employee_ ") shall provide for employment with Purchaser or an Affiliate of
Purchaser to commence effective as of 12:00 A.M., local time, on the date
the Inactive Employee becomes available to return to work and shall be
conditioned on the Inactive Employee becoming available to return to work
within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the Closing Date or within such
longer time as may be required by applicable Law or Labor Contract.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any offers of employment made
to Deferred Transfer Employees shall be governed by the Transition Services
Agreement. All offers of employment shall be made in accordance with the
applicable provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.01_ and the Transition
Services Agreement. Not later than ten (10) days prior to the Anticipated
Closing Date, Seller shall provide Purchaser non-anonymized updates to
_Section_ __ _ 1.01(a)(ii)_ and _Section_ __ _ 1.01(b)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter. Each Offer Employee who accepts Purchasers or one of
its Affiliates offer of employment and whose employment with Purchaser or
one of its Affiliates commences pursuant to this Amended Agreement or the
Transition Services Agreement, together with each Business Employee employed
by a Transferred Entity, along with each Automatic Transfer Employee, shall
be referred to herein as a " _Transferred Employee_ " and the date on which
any such Transferred Employee commences employment with Purchaser or one of
its Affiliates shall be referred to herein as the Transferred Employees "
_Transfer Date_." An Offer Employee

 



89

    

 (other than an Inactive Employee) who arrives at his or her then applicable
place of employment in the Business on the Closing Date shall be deemed for
all purposes of this Amended Agreement to have accepted Purchasers or one of
its Affiliates offer of employment for all purposes of this Amended
Agreement. An Inactive Employee who arrives at his or her then applicable
place of employment in the Business in accordance with an offer made to such
Inactive Employee pursuant this _Section_ __ _ 7.01(a)_ shall be deemed for
all purposes of this Amended Agreement to have accepted Purchasers or one of
its Affiliates offer of employment for all purposes of this Amended
Agreement. Offers pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.01(a)_ shall be on terms
and conditions consistent with _Section_ __ _ 7.01(c)_, be at a location not
more than twenty-five (25) miles from such Offer Employees principal place
of employment immediately prior to the Closing, and otherwise comply in all
respects with such applicable Law (including with respect to compensation and
benefits) and may, if Seller reasonably requests, make employment contingent
upon the Transferred Employees waiver of any and all claims or right to
severance in connection with the transfer of employment subject to applicable
law; _provided_ , _however_ , that all offers of employment to Offer
Employees whose terms and conditions of employment are governed by a Labor
Contract shall be in accordance and comply with the terms of such applicable
Labor Contract.

 

(b) The parties intend that, in accordance with the Transfer Regulations, the
employment and the Employment Agreements of the Automatic Transfer Employees
will (other than in respect of any such employee who objects to a transfer or
resigns and leaves prior to the Closing) transfer from Seller or one of its
Affiliates automatically by operation of law to Purchaser or one of
its Affiliates as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Amended
Agreement, and, accordingly, each such Employment Agreement will have effect
after the relevant transfer as if originally made between Purchaser, or such
applicable Affiliate of Purchaser, and the applicable Automatic Transfer
Employee, and all rights, powers, duties, liabilities and obligations of
Seller or its Affiliates in respect of, or in relation to, such Automatic
Transfer Employees and their Employment Agreement in effect immediately prior
to the relevant transfer will transfer to Purchaser or its Affiliates in
accordance with the Transfer Regulations. Seller and its Subsidiaries will use
commercially reasonable efforts to comply in all respects with
their obligations to inform and consult under the Transfer Regulations and
other applicable Law in respect of such transfers. Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall use reasonable best efforts to provide such information
within its control as Seller or its Affiliates may reasonably require in
sufficient time to enable Seller and its Affiliates to meet any information
and consultation obligations they may have pursuant to the Transfer
Regulations or other applicable Law with or in relation to their employees or
any representative of those employees in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Amended Agreement.

(c) With respect to each Transferred Employee, for the one-year period
immediately following the Closing Date (the " _Transition Period_ "),
Purchaser or its Affiliates shall provide to each Transferred Employee (i)
annual cash bonus opportunities, equity-based compensation and base salary or
wage rates, as applicable, the amount of which is no less favorable in the
aggregate than the aggregate amount provided to such Transferred
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) employee benefits
that are no less beneficial in the aggregate to the benefits provided by
Purchaser to similarly situated employees, without regard, in each case of
clauses (i) and (ii), to defined benefit pension benefits, or post-
termination health and welfare benefits or retention arrangements; _provided_
, _however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 7.01(c)_
to the contrary, such compensation and benefits provided by Purchaser during
the Transition Period shall be of the type and at levels sufficient to comply
with applicable Law or the terms of any Labor Contract. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contemplated by this Amended Agreement shall be construed
as requiring either Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to be obligated to
continue the employment or services of any Transferred Employee for any period
after the applicable Transfer Date.

 



90

    

(d) With respect to each Transferred Employee whose employment terminates
during the Transition Period, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall provide
severance benefits that are no less favorable than those severance or
termination benefits provided under Purchasers severance plan, program,
policy or practice (whether contractual or otherwise) applicable to such
Transferred Employee on the date of such Transferred Employees termination;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _
7.01(c)_ to the contrary, such severance or termination benefits shall be of
the type and at levels sufficient to comply with applicable Law or the terms
of any Labor Contract.

 

(e) With respect to each Transferred Employee, effective from and after the
applicable Transfer Date, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall (i) recognize for
the benefit of the Transferred Employees for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting and for purposes of severance pay,, vacation and paid
time off, benefit accrual, service with Seller and its Affiliates through the
applicable Transfer Date under any such Purchaser Benefit Plan that that
recognizes service for such purposes (or as otherwise required by applicable
Law or the terms of any Labor Contract), except to the extent necessary to
avoid duplication of benefits or with respect to any benefit accrual under
any defined benefit pension plan that is not an Assumed Benefit Plan, and (ii)
with respect to Purchaser Benefit Plans, use commercially reasonable efforts
to waive any pre-existing condition exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or
waiting period under all employee health and other welfare benefit plans
established or maintained by Seller or its Affiliates for the benefit of the
Transferred Employees, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition,
exclusion, requirement or waiting period would have applied to such
individual under the corresponding Business Benefit Plan.

(f) To the extent any Offer Employee becomes entitled to any payments payable
upon a separation, termination or severance from employment prior to the
Closing Date that are not incurred as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Amended Agreement, then Seller shall be, or shall cause
its Affiliates to be, solely responsible for any and all such costs. Except
as otherwise required by applicable Laws, Seller and Purchaser intend that the
transactions contemplated by this Amended Agreement should not constitute a
separation, termination or severance of employment of any Employee prior to
or upon the occurrence of the Transfer Date, including for purposes of any
Business Benefit Plan that provides for separation, termination or severance
benefits or that requires an Employee to repay his or her employer any
amounts, including sign-on bonuses, tuition reimbursements and housing
differential payments, upon a termination of employment, and that each such
Transferred Employee will have continuous and uninterrupted employment
immediately before and immediately after the Transfer Date, and Seller and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, comply with
any requirements under applicable Law to ensure the same. Seller is
responsible for timely providing any notice required under the WARN Act in
connection with the termination of employment of any Employee that occurs on
or before the Closing Date, and Seller agrees to timely provide such
notice. The parties hereto do not intend the termination of Transferred
Employees by Seller to be an employment loss for the purposes of the WARN Act.
To the extent any separation, termination, severance or other payments are
incurred with respect to Transferred Employees as described in this _Section_
__ _ 7.01(f)_ as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Amended
Agreement as a result of such payments being required by applicable Laws or
any Labor Contract or Employment Agreement (the " _Transfer Severance_ "),
then Seller shall be, or shall cause its Affiliates to be, solely responsible
for any and all Transfer Severance costs, _provided_ , _however_ , that
Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for fifty percent (50%) of the Transfer
Severance costs incurred by Seller within thirty (30) days following receipt
of a summary description of such costs incurred and other documentation
reasonably requested by Purchaser. To the extent any separation, termination,
severance or other payments are incurred with respect to Transferred Employees
as described in this _Section_ __ _ 7.01(f)_ as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Amended Agreement other than as a result of such
payments being required by applicable Laws or any Labor Contract or Employment
Agreement, then Seller shall be, or shall cause its Affiliates to be, solely
responsible for any and all such costs. If an Offer Employee does not receive
an offer of employment

 



91

    

 from Purchaser or one of its Affiliates pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(a)_
or does not meet the requirements of _Section_ __ _ 7.01(a)_ (including
the requirements of such offer as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.01(c)_) and
Seller or one of its Affiliates is obligated to pay notice, termination or
severance payments or severance benefits to such Offer Employee, then
Purchaser shall be, or shall cause its Affiliates to be, solely responsible
for any and all such costs. If an Offer Employee does receive an offer of
employment from Purchaser or one of its Affiliates in connection with
_Section_ __ _ 7.01(a)_ and if that Offer Employee either (x) does not
accept the offer of employment, (y) fails to execute Purchasers customary
assignment of inventions, work made for hire, non-disclosure, non-solicitation
and/or non-competition agreements (as applicable), or (z) resigns from his or
her employment prior to the Transfer Date and, in each case, such
Offer Employee becomes entitled to pay notice, termination or severance
payments or severance benefits, then Seller or one of its Affiliates will be
solely responsible for any and all such costs.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (including _Section_ __ _
6.06_), Purchaser shall be, or shall cause an Affiliate to be, solely
responsible, either directly or shall reimburse Seller for, all covered
medical, vision, dental, prescription drug and other welfare plan expenses and
claims incurred, and claims for disability income benefits made, by
any Transferred Employee or his or her dependents, on or prior to the
Transfer Date under any Business Benefit Plan in accordance with the terms of
such Business Benefit Plan. Purchaser shall be, or shall cause its Affiliates
to be, responsible for all covered medical, vision, dental, prescription drug
and other welfare plan expenses incurred, and claims for disability income
benefits made, by any Transferred Employee or his or her dependents after the
Transfer Date under any Purchaser Benefit plan. Except in the event of any
claim for workers compensation benefits, for purposes of this Amended
Agreement, the following claims and liabilities shall be deemed to be incurred
as follows: (i) medical, vision, dental and/or prescription drug benefits
(including hospital expenses), upon provision of the services, materials or
supplies constituting any such benefits and (ii) insurance benefits, upon the
death, illness, injury or accident giving rise to such benefits. Purchaser
and its Affiliates shall be responsible for, or shall reimburse Seller for,
all claims for U.S. workers compensation benefits that are incurred either
(x) prior to the Transfer Date by any Transferred Employee or (y) on or prior
to the Closing Date by any Business Employee who does not become a Transferred
Employee. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be responsible for all claims for
U.S. workers compensation benefits that are incurred on or after the Transfer
Date by any Transferred Employee. A claim for U.S. workers compensation
benefits shall be deemed incurred when the event giving rise to the claim
occurs.

 

(h) Subject to local Laws, if any Employee requires a work permit, employment
pass, visa or other legal or regulatory approval for his or her employment
with Purchaser or its Affiliates, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such permit,
pass, visa or other approval to be obtained and in effect prior to the
Transfer Date, and Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take all
reasonably necessary or appropriate action at Purchasers expense, as
reasonably requested by Purchaser, to assist in obtaining any such permit,
pass, visa or other approval prior to the Transfer Date.

(i) As of the Transfer Date, Seller shall provide to Purchaser and its
Affiliates copies of all employment records for each Transferred Employee
required to be provided to Purchaser and its Affiliates under applicable Law
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide all employment
records for any other Transferred Employee as reasonably requested
by Purchaser, in each case, the transfer of which is not prohibited by
applicable Law or subject to such Transferred Employees consent where
required. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall ensure that all such records are
used only in connection with the employment of such Transferred Employee and
shall keep such employment records confidential to the extent required under
applicable Law.

 



92

    

(j) As required by applicable Laws, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
relevant Affiliate to, grant each Transferred Employee paid time off in an
amount equal to such Transferred Employees accrued and unused vacation hours.
Seller shall provide a reasonable estimate of each Transferred Employees
accrued and unused vacation hours as soon as practicable after the date of
the Original Agreement, and will update such estimates immediately prior to
the applicable Transfer Date. If any accrued and unused vacation hours are
required to be paid to the Transferred Employee in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Amended Agreement, immediately prior to the
applicable Transfer Date, Seller shall be (or shall cause its Affiliates to
be) solely responsible for, and pay to each Transferred Employee, the amount
of compensation with respect to the accrued and unused vacation hours that is
due and owing to such Transferred Employee as of immediately prior to the
applicable Transfer Date.

 

(k) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with Purchaser
and its Affiliates in respect of Purchasers efforts to hire at the Closing
Date the Offer Employees and to retain at the Closing Date the Transferred
Employees and shall take no actions to cause any individual who would be as of
the date of the Original Agreement a Business Employee to be transferred to
any business or function of Seller or any of its Affiliates other than the
Business. Prior to the applicable Transfer Date, Purchaser may not communicate
directly with any Employee or Labor Organization until Seller has first been
afforded a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any proposed
communications. Seller (or any of its Affiliates) shall neither communicate
directly with any Employee nor Labor Organization regarding the terms and
conditions of their employment with Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates) nor
make or deliver any formal written communications or oral representations to
any Employee regarding Purchasers offers of employment or such Employees
transfers of employment, or any other compensation or personnel matters
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Amended Agreement, in either
case, until Purchaser has first been afforded a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any such proposed communications.

 

(l) To the extent permitted by applicable Law or Contract, Seller shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, assign to Purchaser and its applicable
Affiliates the right to enforce any provisions in any agreement to which any
Former Business Employee or Business Employee who does not become a
Transferred Employee is bound, to the extent such provision relates primarily
or exclusively to the Business, including any assignment of inventions, work
made for hire, confidentiality, non-competition or non-solicitation provisions
contained in any such agreements.

(m) For a period of time equal to the applicable statute of limitations in the
relevant jurisdiction for claims that may be brought by employees plus thirty
(30) days, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to provide Purchaser
reasonable access, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, to all
personnel files in Seller or its Affiliates possession relating to
Transferred Employees that cannot be transferred to Purchaser under applicable
Law.

Section 7.02 _Assumption of Assumed Benefit Plans; Transfer of Related
Assets_.

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date or such later date as set forth in
the Transition Services Agreement, Seller shall or shall cause its affiliates
to take all actions necessary so that all Transferred Employees shall cease

this Amended Agreement to the contrary, effective as of the Closing, Purchaser
shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, assume all of the rights,
title, interests, obligations and liabilities under each of the Assumed
Benefit Plans.

 



93

    

(b) Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause one if
its Affiliates to, assume sponsorship of, and shall succeed to all of the
rights, title and interest (including the rights of Seller or any of its
Affiliates, as applicable, if any, as plan sponsor, plan administrator or
employer) under, each Assumed Benefit Plan, including each Transferred
Pension Plan set forth on _Section_ __ _ 1.01(n)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter. The parties hereto shall use their reasonable commercial efforts to
cooperate with each other, and shall cause their officers, employees, agents,
auditors and representatives to cooperate with each other after the Closing
Date in the execution of any documents, adoption of any corporate resolutions
or the taking of all actions that are necessary and appropriate to effectuate
such sponsorship and related transfers of Assumed Benefit Plans and related
assets.

(c) Purchaser acknowledges that all Labor Contracts to which any Transferred
Entity is party or by which a Transferred Entity is bound will remain in

Labor Contract to which Seller or any of its Affiliates is a party or by which
Seller or any of its Affiliates is bound that relates to Offer Employees.

 

(d) Effective as of the Closing Date or as soon as administratively
practicable following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall establish or provide
a flexible spending plan maintained in the United States and, for the
avoidance of doubt, a health reimbursement account plan maintained in the
United States (collectively, the " _Purchaser FSA Plan_ ") in which
Transferred Employees in the United States will be eligible to participate.
Where applicable, Seller and its Affiliates and Purchaser shall take all
commercially reasonable actions necessary or appropriate so that, effective as
of the Closing Date, (i) the account balances (whether positive or negative)
(the " _Transferred FSA Balances_ ") under the applicable flexible spending
plan of Seller or its Affiliates (collectively, the " _Seller FSA Plan_ ") of
the Transferred Employees in the United States who are participants in the
Seller FSA Plan shall be transferred to the Purchaser FSA Plan; (ii) the
elections of such Transferred Employees in the United States shall apply under
the Purchaser FSA Plan in the same manner as under the Seller FSA Plan; and
(iii) such Transferred Employees in the United States shall be reimbursed from
the Purchaser FSA Plan for claims incurred at any time during the plan year of
the Seller FSA Plan in which the Closing Date occurs that are submitted to
the Purchaser FSA Plan from and after the Closing Date on the same basis and
the same terms and conditions as under the Seller FSA Plan. As soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, and in any event within ten (10) Business
Days after the amount of the Transferred FSA Balances is determined, (A)
Seller shall pay Purchaser or one or more of its designated Affiliates, in
cash, the net aggregate amount of the Transferred FSA Balances, if
such amount is positive, or (B) Purchaser shall pay to Seller, or one or more
of its designated Affiliates, in cash, the net aggregate amount of the
Transferred FSA Balances, if such amount is negative.

 

(e) Effective as of or as soon as administratively practicable following the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall establish or provide a defined contribution
401(k) plan maintained in the United States in which Transferred Employees in
the United States will be eligible to participate (the " _Purchaser_ _401(k)_
_Plan_ "). Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller shall take all actions
necessary to fully vest each Transferred Employee in the United States who is
a participant in a Seller Plan that is a defined contribution Section 401(a)
plan (the " _Seller_ _401(k)_ _Plan_ "), in their entire balance in the
Seller 401(k) Plan. As soon as administratively practicable following the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall take all commercially reasonably actions
necessary to permit Transferred Employees in the United States who have an
account balance in the Seller 401(k) Plan to rollover (whether by direct or
indirect rollover, as selected by such Transferred Employees) his or her
"eligible rollover distribution" (as defined under Section 402(c)(4) of the
Code) in the form of cash, a promissory note (in the case of loans) or any

94

    

(f) Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause one if
its Affiliates to, honor and assume all Liabilities for, and to make any and

borne one-half by Purchaser and one-half by Seller; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (a) Seller shall be liable for, and shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates from and against, all Transfer Taxes
incurred in connection with the Pre-Closing Restructuring and (b) Purchaser
shall be liable for, and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and
its Affiliates from and against, all VAT arising from the acquisition of
Transferred Assets or Transferred Entities by Purchaser or a
designated Affiliate of Purchaser pursuant to this Amended Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, any
transactions in connection with or relating to the Pre-
Closing Restructuring). The party responsible under applicable Law for filing
the Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall prepare and timely
file such Tax Returns and promptly provide a copy of such Tax Return to the
other party, except that Seller shall prepare and file all Tax Returns with
respect to Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the Pre-Closing
Restructuring and promptly provide a copy thereof to Purchaser. Seller and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, reasonably
cooperate to timely prepare and file any Tax Returns or other filings relating

Section 8.02 _Tax Characterization of Adjustments_. Seller and Purchaser agree
to treat all payments made either to or for the benefit of the other
following the respective Closings (including any payments made under any
indemnity provisions of this Amended Agreement) as adjustments to the Purchase
Price for all Tax purposes, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

Section 8.03 _Straddle Periods_

 

For all purposes of this Amended Agreement:

 

(a) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.03(b)_, any Taxes of or with
respect to a Transferred Entity or the Transferred Assets for any Straddle
Period shall be apportioned between the portion of the period ending on the
Closing Date and the portion of the period commencing on the day immediately
following the Closing Date, based on an interim closing of the books, as if
the Closing Date were the end of a Tax period, and each such portion of such
period shall be deemed to be a separate taxable period; _provided_ , that,
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
(including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions)
shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date and the
period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in
each period to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

(b) In the case of any real property, personal property and similar _ad
valorem_ Taxes or other periodic Taxes that are payable for a taxable period
that includes, but does not end on, the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax
which relates to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date
shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
taxable period ending on (and including) the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period and the portion
of such Tax which relates to the portion of such taxable period beginning
immediately after the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the taxable period beginning after the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable
period.

 

Section 8.04 _Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Seller shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) (i) all Tax Returns of the
Transferred Entities or in respect of the Transferred Assets or the Business
with respect to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date (" _Pre-
Closing Tax Returns_") and (ii) all Combined Tax Returns. Pre-Closing Tax
Returns of the Transferred Entities shall be prepared on a basis consistent
with the past practices of the applicable Transferred Entity, except as
otherwise required by applicable Law. Seller shall deliver to Purchaser for
its review and reasonable comment no less than thirty (30) days prior to the
applicable filing deadline (taking into account applicable extensions) any
Pre-Closing Tax Return with respect to a Transferred Entity (other a Combined
Tax Return) that has a due date (including applicable extensions) after the
Closing Date and Seller shall consider in good faith any reasonable written
comments that Purchaser submits to Seller no later than ten (10) days
following the delivery of such Pre-Closing Tax Return to Seller such Pre-
Closing Tax Return. Purchaser shall timely file (or cause to be timely filed)
all such Pre-Closing Tax Returns due after the Closing Date (including
applicable extensions) with respect to the Transferred Entities (other than
Combined Tax Returns) and Seller shall timely file (or cause to be timely
filed) all Pre-Closing Tax Returns with respect to the Transferred Assets and
all Combined Tax Returns. Seller shall pay (or cause to be paid, which payment
shall be satisfied if Seller pays to Purchaser the amount of Taxes due for a
Tax return that Purchaser is responsible for filing hereunder) all Taxes due
with respect to such Tax Returns to the extent Seller is liable for such Taxes
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 11.07_.

 



97

    

(b) Purchaser shall prepare and timely file (or cause to be prepared and
timely filed) all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Transferred
Entities or with respect to the Business or the Transferred Assets with
respect to Straddle Periods other than the Tax Returns covered in _Section_ __
_ 8.04(a) _(collectively, " _Straddle Period Tax Returns_ "). All such
Straddle Period Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past
practices of the applicable Transferred Entity or, in the case of the
Transferred Assets, the Business, except as otherwise required by Law.
Purchaser shall deliver to Seller for its review and reasonable comment no
less than thirty (30) days prior to the applicable filing deadline (taking
into account applicable extensions), a copy of any such Straddle Period Tax
Return proposed to be filed. Purchaser shall consider in good faith any
reasonable written comments to any such Straddle Period Tax Return that Seller
submits to Purchaser no later than ten (10) days following the delivery of
such Straddle Period Tax Return to Seller. To the extent Seller is
responsible pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.07_ for any amount of Taxes due
with respect to such Straddle Period Tax Returns, Seller shall pay Purchaser
such amount at least five (5) days before such Tax Return is due.

(c) Purchaser and Seller shall act in good faith to resolve any
disputes concerning any item on a Tax Return described in _Sections_ __ _
8.04(a)_ or _8.04(b)_. If Purchaser and Seller cannot resolve any disputed
item, the item in question shall be resolved by the Accounting Arbitrator. The
costs, fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne equally
by Purchaser and Seller. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve any
such dispute prior to the date on which the relevant Tax Return is required to
be filed, any such Tax Return shall be filed in the manner that the party
responsible for filing such Tax Return pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.04(a)_ or
_8.04(b)_ deems correct, and such Tax Return shall be amended as necessary to
reflect the final resolution of such dispute.

(d) Except as contemplated by this Amended Agreement (including _Section_ __ _
8.06_), Purchaser and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the
Transferred Entities) shall not, without the consent of Seller, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (a) amend, refile,
revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election with respect to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, (b) make any Tax election or change any accounting
period or method with retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
that could otherwise be reasonably be expected to increase the Tax liability
of Seller or its Affiliates with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (c)
take any action to extend the applicable statute of limitations with respect
to any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 

(e) The parties hereto shall, to the extent permitted under applicable Tax
Law, elect to treat the Closing Date as the last day of any taxable period of
the Transferred Entities that includes the Closing Date; _provided_ that no
party shall be required to amend any articles of association, change any
financial accounting period, or otherwise take any action other than solely
for Tax purposes.

Section 8.05 _Tax Refunds_. Any refund or credit of Taxes (including as a
result of any overpayment of Taxes in prior periods (or portions thereof in
the case of a Straddle Period) and including any interest thereon) accruing to
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in respect of the Transferred Entities or
as a result of the ownership of the Transferred Assets or the Business (each,
a " _Tax Asset_ ") attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than any
such refund or credit resulting from the carryback of losses, credits or
similar items of a Transferred Entity, as the case may be, attributable to a
Post-Closing Tax Period) shall be for the account of Seller, except to the
extent such Tax Asset was taken into account in the adjustment described in
_Section_ __ _ 2.04_. Purchaser shall pay and shall cause its Affiliates to
pay, to Seller the amount of the Tax Asset, net of any reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses incurred in obtaining such Tax Asset, within ten (10) days
after such Tax Asset is received or after such Tax Asset is allowed or applied
against another Tax liability, as the case may be. Purchaser shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates 

 



98

    

 to, execute such documents, file such Tax Returns (including amended Tax
Returns), take reasonable additional actions and otherwise reasonably
cooperate as may be necessary for Purchaser and its Affiliates to perfect
their rights in and obtain all Tax Assets for which Seller is entitled
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.05_. None of Purchaser or its Affiliates
shall surrender forfeit, fail to collect or otherwise minimize or delay any
material Tax Asset to which Seller would be entitled pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.05_. Except as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 8.05_,
Purchaser and the Transferred Entities will be entitled to any refunds
(including any interest received thereon) in respect of any federal, state,
local or foreign Tax liability of the Transferred Entities or in respect of
the Business received following the Closing Date.

 

Section 8.06 _Tax Elections and Cooperation_.

 

(a) Except with the consent of Seller, or as provided on _Section_ __ _ 8.06_
of the Seller Disclosure Letter, no elections shall be made (i) under Section
338(g) of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state or
local law) with respect to the acquisition of the Transferred Equity Interests
or (ii) to treat any Transferred Entity that is organized outside the United
States as an entity disregarded as separate from its owner, or as a
partnership (in the case of a Transferred Entity with multiple owners), for
U.S. federal income tax purposes or convert any such Transferred Entity under
applicable law so that it is so treated. Seller shall take all reasonable
steps to cause any such scheduled election or conversion described in
_Section_ __ _ 8.06(a)(ii)_ to be made effective prior to the Closing
Date, including by filing or by causing to be filed, a properly completed
Internal Revenue Service Form 8832 (or any successor form), which, once made,
shall not be terminated or revoked without the written consent of Purchaser.
Seller and the Subsidiary Transferors shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to execute (or cause to be executed) and deliver to Purchaser such
documents or forms as are reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with
the making of any elections pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.06_.

(b) Seller and Purchaser shall provide each other with such cooperation and
information as either of them reasonably may request of the other in filing
any Tax Return, amended return or claim for refund, determining a liability
for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or participating in or conducting
any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes, including making any and
all joint elections reasonably requested by the other party in connection with
any such Tax Return, amended return or claim for refund. Any information
obtained under this  _Section_ __ _ 8.06_ shall be kept confidential, except
as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or
claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.

 

(c) Within five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
provide to Purchaser a revised  _Section_ __ _ 4.15(h)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, setting forth the intended jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization, and the U.S. federal income tax classification (e.g.,
corporation, partnership, disregarded entity) of each Transferred Entity as
of the Closing Date.

Section 8.07 _Tax Clearance Certificates_. With respect to each
jurisdiction set forth on _Section_ __ _ 8.07_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, Seller shall provide such cooperation as is reasonably requested by
Purchaser for the purpose of obtaining any available tax clearance certificate
(" _Tax Clearance Certificate_ ") if the failure to obtain such Tax Clearance
Certificate could subject Purchaser to any Taxes of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries. If, in respect to any application for a Tax Clearance
Certificates made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.07_, any Governmental
Authority asserts that Purchaser is liable for any Tax of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, Seller shall promptly pay any and all such amounts and shall
provide evidence to Purchaser that such liabilities have been paid in full or
otherwise satisfied.

(a) In the event of termination of this Amended Agreement and the abandonment

set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 10.02_, _Section_ __ _ 10.03_,  _Section_
__ _ 6.03_, _Section_ __ _ 6.12(d)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.12(e)_ __ and
_Article XII_ and the Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) such termination
shall relieve each party to this Amended Agreement from liability for all
violations of this Amended Agreement that occurred prior to such termination;
_provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, no such termination shall
relieve (1) Purchaser of any liability to pay (if and when due) the
Regulatory Termination Fee in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 10.02_
(subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 10.02_ and 
_Section_ __ _ 10.03_) and (2) any party hereto from any liability for any
material and intentional breach by a party of the terms and provisions of this
Amended Agreement (subject to the limitations set forth in  _Section_ __ _
10.03_).

(b) In the event that this Amended Agreement is validly terminated by Seller
or Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.01(b)_ or _Section_ __ _
10.01(c)_, and at the time of such termination one or more of the conditions
to Closing set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.01(c)_,  _Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)_,
_Section_ __ _ 9.02(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.02(d)_ (but for purposes of
_Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.02(d)_, only if each Restraint
giving rise to such non-satisfaction is attributable to a Review Law) shall
not have been satisfied, but all other conditions to Closing set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 9.02_ have been satisfied (or, in the case of any condition
that by its nature is to be satisfied at the Closing, would be satisfied if
the Closing were to occur on the date of such termination), then Purchaser
shall pay to Seller an amount in cash equal to One Hundred Million Dollars
($100,000,000) (the " _Regulatory Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated in writing by
Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Regulatory Termination Fee shall be
payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.02(b)_ in the event that Seller
has not complied in all material respects with its obligations under _Section_
__ _ 6.04_ and such breach resulted in the conditions to Closing set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 9.01(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)_, _Section_ __ _
9.02(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.02(d)_ (but for purposes of _Section_ __ _
9.01(d)_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.02(d)_, only if each Restraint giving rise to
such non-satisfaction is attributable to a Review Law) not being
satisfied. Such payment shall be due within five (5) Business Days after
written notice of termination by Purchaser or Seller pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 10.02(b)_.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Amended Agreement to the contrary, if
Seller receives the Regulatory Termination Fee from Purchaser pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 10.02(b)_, such payment, together with the amounts as provided
in the last two sentences of _Section_ __ _ 6.12(d)_ and any costs, expenses
and interest payable pursuant to the last sentence of this _Section_ __ _
10.02(c)_, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller and each other
Seller Related Party against the Purchaser Related Parties under this Amended
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and no Purchaser Related Party
shall have any further liability or obligations related to or arising out of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The parties acknowledge and
agree that any payment of the Regulatory Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 10.02_ is not a penalty but is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount
that will compensate Seller in the circumstances in which such fee is payable
for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Amended Agreement and in reliance on this Amended Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. If Purchaser fails to promptly pay the Regulatory
Termination Fee when due, and in order to obtain such payment, Seller
commences an Action that results in a judgment against Purchaser for such
Regulatory Termination Fee or any portion thereof, Purchaser shall pay to
Seller the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs

 



103

    

 and expenses (including attorneys fees) of Seller in connection with such
Action, together with interest on the amount of such Regulatory Termination
Fee or portion thereof at the prime rate as published by Bloomberg (BGN New
York), in effect as of 5:00 P.M., New York time, on the date such payment was
required to be made through the date of payment.

 

Section 10.03 _Limitation; Acknowledgement_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Amended Agreement, in no
event shall Purchaser be required or obligated to pay the Regulatory
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. For the avoidance of doubt,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, under no circumstances shall
Seller be permitted or entitled to receive (i) any monetary damages or
the Regulatory Termination Fee in the event that Seller obtains a grant of
specific performance of the obligation to close as contemplated by _Section_
__ _ 12.13_ and the Closing subsequently occurs or (ii) any monetary
damages and the Regulatory Termination Fee; _provided_ that, for clarity,
nothing herein shall reduce, diminish or otherwise modify Sellers
indemnification rights set forth in _Article XI_.

 

(b) The parties acknowledge and agree that the Regulatory Termination Fee and
the other provisions of this _Article X_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby and without these agreements, Seller and
Purchaser would not enter into this Amended Agreement.

 

ARTICLE XI

as of the Closing Date (other than such representations and warranties that
refer to a specified date, in which case as of such date);

 

(ii) any breach of any of the Seller Fundamental Representations or such
corresponding representations and warranties contained in any certificate
delivered by Seller pursuant to this Amended Agreement, in each case, as of
the date of the Original Agreement or as of the Closing Date (other than such
representations and warranties that refer to a specified date, in which case
as of such date);

(iii) any breach of any of the Specified Representations or such corresponding
representations and warranties contained in any certificate delivered by
Seller pursuant to this Amended Agreement, in each case, as of the date of the

(iv) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under _Section_ __ _
11.01(a)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)(iii)_ for any claim where the Losses
relating thereto are less than One Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand
Dollars ($125,000) (the " _De Minimis_ ") (it being understood that any
series of related claims shall be aggregated for purposes of this _clause_ __
_ (b)(iv)_ and the immediately preceding  _clause_ __ _ (b)(iii)_);

(v) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under  _Section_ __ _
11.01(a)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)(iii)_ for any amount that when

105

    

(vi) With respect to indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)(iii)_ in
connection with any breach of the representations and warranties contained in
the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 4.14(c)_, such obligations to indemnify

as a direct result of such Loss, determined on a "with and without" basis;

 

(ix) The obligations to indemnify under _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)(iii)_ with
respect to any breach of the representations and warranties contained in

matters set forth on _Section_ __ _ 1.01(h)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter
(with respect to clauses (a)(i) and (c) of the definition of Retained
Environmental Liabilities) (each, an " _Environmental Claim_ ") shall not
apply to any Losses resulting from or relating to (i) any environmental matter
or condition that is discovered or detected by any sampling, investigation or
reporting by or on behalf of the Purchaser Indemnified Persons that is not
required by Environmental Laws, or (ii) any environmental investigatory,
corrective or remedial action (including any Remedial Action), except to the
extent such action is required by Environmental Laws and is limited to the
lowest cost alternative reasonably available to allow either (A) continued
operation of the Real Property in substantially the same manner it was
operated at the Closing on the basis of the minimum reasonably required to
comply with any settlement or resolution with any Governmental Authority and
Environmental Laws and in a manner that does not materially interfere
with such operations at the Real Property, or (B) closure or termination of
operations at the Real Property in compliance with Environmental Laws (it
being understood that closure or termination of operations does not include
any disturbance of the applicable Real Property except to the extent required
by applicable Law as a result of such closure or termination of operations).
Taking no action shall constitute an acceptable lowest cost alternative if,
after investigation, taking no action is determined to be in compliance with
Environmental Laws and such inaction is not prohibited by relevant
Governmental Authorities. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to claim or seek
indemnity with respect to any Environmental Claim under this Amended Agreement
to the extent that such Environmental Claim arises out of any development,
modification or change of use of any of the Real Property after the Closing to
a use other than the continued operation of the Business or the continuation
of the activities necessary to support the Business as it was conducted as of
the Closing, where such development, modification or change results in the
application of stricter cleanup standards pursuant to Environmental Laws;
_provided_ , _however_ , that closure or termination of operations at a Real
Property shall not constitute such a development, modification or change in
use (it being understood that closure or termination of operations does not
include any disturbance of the applicable Real Property except to the extent
required by applicable Law as a result of such closure or termination of
operations); and

 



106

    

(x) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 11.01(b)(iii)_, the Deductible shall not
apply to any claim for indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)(i)_ in
respect of the representation and warranty in _Section_ __ _ 4.07(b)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that there shall be no obligation to indemnify under
_Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)(i)_ in respect of the representation and warranty in
_Section_ __ _ 4.07(b)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of such Losses
exceeds an amount equal to $10,000,000, in which event the Purchaser
Indemnified Persons shall be entitled (subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to
the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.01(b)(iv)_) to make a claim
for indemnification for all Losses incurred by any Purchaser Indemnified
Person in respect of the representation and warranty in _Section_ __ _
4.07(b)_ from the first dollar of such Losses.

 

(c) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller, its Affiliates and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees, partners, members and agents (collectively, the "
_Seller Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against any and all Losses suffered,
incurred or sustained by any of them (without duplication for
any indemnification that may be sought under more than one clause of this
_Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)_) that result from, relate to or arise out of:

 

(i) any breach of any of Purchasers representations and warranties contained
in this Amended Agreement (other than the Purchaser Fundamental
Representations) or such corresponding representations and warranties
contained in any certificate delivered by Purchaser pursuant to this Amended
Agreement, in each case, as of the date of the Original Agreement or as of the
Closing Date (other than such representations and warranties that refer to a
specified date, in which case as of such date);

(ii) any breach of any of the Purchaser Fundamental Representations or such
corresponding representations and warranties contained in any certificate
delivered by Purchaser pursuant to this Amended Agreement, in each case, as of
the date of the Original Agreement or as of the Closing Date (other than such
representations and warranties that refer to a specified date, in which case
as of such date);

 

(iii) any breach of any of Purchasers agreements, obligations or covenants
contained in this Amended Agreement; and

 

(iv) the operation of the Business from and after the Closing or the Assumed
Liabilities.

 

 _provided_ that all matters relating to Taxes (including Taxes relating to
the Pre-Closing Restructuring) shall be governed exclusively by _Section_ __
_ 11.07_.

(d) Purchasers indemnification obligations under _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)_
shall be subject to each of the following limitations:

(i) (A) With respect to indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)(i)_,
such obligation to indemnify shall survive the Closing and remain in full
force and effect until the date that is eighteen (18) months from the Closing
Date; (B) with respect to indemnification under _Section_ __ _
11.01(c)(ii)_, such obligation to indemnify shall survive the Closing and
remain in full force and effect until the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations; and (C) with respect to indemnification under _Section_ __ _
11.01(c)(iv)_ such obligation to indemnify shall survive the Closing and
remain in full force and effect in perpetuity;

 



107

    

(ii) With respect to indemnification under _Section_ __ _
11.01(c)(iii)_, such obligation to indemnify shall, (A) with respect to the
underlying agreements, obligations and covenants of Purchaser that require
performance on or prior to the Closing, shall survive the Closing and remain
in full force and effect until the date that is eighteen (18) months from the
Closing Date, and with respect to the underlying agreements, obligations and
covenants of Purchaser that require performance from and after the Closing,
shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect in accordance
with the terms of such underlying agreements, obligations and covenants of
Purchaser;

(iii) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under _Section_ __ _
11.01(c)(i)_ unless the aggregate of all Losses for which Purchaser, but for
this _clause_ __ _ (iii)_, would be liable under  _Section_ __ _
11.01(c)(i)_ exceeds on a cumulative basis the Deductible and then only to the
extent of such excess;

 

(iv) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under _Section_ __ _
11.01(c)(i)_ for any claim where the Losses relating thereto are less than
the De Minimis (it being understood that any series of related claims shall be
aggregated for purposes of this _clause_ __ _ (d)(iv)_ and the immediately
preceding _clause_ __ _ (d)(iii)_); 

(v) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, there shall be no
obligation to indemnify under  _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)(i)_ for any amount
that when aggregated with all other amounts payable as a result of
indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)(i)_ (but for the application of
this  _Section_ __ _ 11.01(d)(v)_) would be in excess of the Cap;

(vi) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, there shall be no
obligation to indemnify under _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)(i)-(iii)_ for any
amount that when aggregated with all other amounts paid as a result of
indemnification under  _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)(i)-(iii)_ would be in excess
of the Unadjusted Purchase Price; and

(vii) For purposes of  _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)_, all Losses shall be (x)
reduced by (A) the amount of any insurance proceeds actually paid to Seller or
any Seller Indemnified Person with respect to such Loss, less the costs
associated with recovering such proceeds and any increases in insurance
premiums, (B) any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually
paid to Seller or any Seller Indemnified Person by any third party with
respect to such Loss, and (C) an amount equal to any net reduction of income
Taxes of Seller or any Seller Indemnified Person attributable to a Tax benefit
actually realized in the year of such loss or the immediately succeeding two
(2) taxable years as a direct result of such Loss, determined on a "with and
without" basis.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in  _Section_ __ _
11.01_, if a claim for indemnification is properly asserted in good faith
pursuant to this _Article XI_ prior to the expiration of the applicable
survival period set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 11.01_, then the applicable
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement relating to such
indemnification claim and the applicable partys indemnification obligations
with respect thereto shall survive until, but only for the purpose of, the
final resolution thereof. For purposes of calculating the amount of any Losses
that are the subject matter of a claim for indemnification hereunder and for
purposes of determining whether or not a breach of any representation or
warranty has occurred, each representation and warranty contained in this
Amended Agreement shall be read without regard and without giving effect to
any qualifiers or exceptions as to "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect,"
or other similar qualifications contained in such representations and
warranties or any certificate delivered pursuant to this Amended Agreement
(other than the second sentence of each of  _Section_ __ _ 4.02(a)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 4.02(b)_ (Pre-Signing Financial Statements; Unaudited Annual
Financial Statements; Audited Financial Statements),  _Section_ __ _
4.03(c)_ (No Undisclosed Liabilities; Absence of Certain Changes or Events),
_Section_ __ _ 4.11(f)_ and the word "Material" in the term "Material
Contracts" and the categories of "Material Contracts" in _Section_ __ _
4.12_) shall be disregarded both for purposes of (i) determining the existence
or occurrence of a breach pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)_ or  _Section_
__ _ 11.01(c)_ and (ii) determining the amount of Losses arising out of or
resulting therefrom.

 



108

    

Section 11.02 _Notice of Claim; Defense_.

 

(a) If (i) any third party or Governmental Authority institutes, threatens or
asserts any action that may give rise to Losses for which a party (an "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") may be liable for indemnification under this _Article
XI_ (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") or (ii) any Person entitled to indemnification
under this Amended Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall have a claim
to be indemnified by an Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third-Party
Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "), then, in case of _clause_ __ _ (i)_ or _(ii)_
, the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in the case of clause (i) in any
event within ten (10) Business Days after receipt by the Indemnified Party of
notice of the Third-Party Claim) send to the Indemnifying Party a written
notice specifying (to the extent known) in reasonable details the nature,
facts and circumstances of such claim and the amount of all related Losses (a
" _Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure to give such
Claim Notice or to provide any such facts or amounts shall not affect the
rights of the indemnified parties except to the extent that such failure
actually prejudices the Indemnifying Party.

 

(b) In the event of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may elect to
retain counsel of its choice, reasonably acceptable to the relevant
Indemnified Parties, to represent such Indemnified Parties in connection with
such Action and shall pay the fees, charges and disbursements of such counsel.
Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to control the defense of a Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified Parties a
reasonable opportunity to participate, at their own expense and through legal
counsel of their choice, in the defense of such Third-Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party advised of the status of
such Third-Party Claim and the defense thereof and shall consider
recommendations made by the Indemnified Party with respect thereto. The
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the
Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the
Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Amended Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or
continue control of the defense of any Third-Party Claim if (A) such Third-
Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding,
(B) such Third-Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against
any Indemnified Party (other than in cases where the primary remedy being
sought by such third party or Governmental Authority is monetary damages), (C)
such Third Party Claim has or would reasonably be expected to result in
Losses (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, for the purpose of this clause
(C), any Tax excess) in excess of the maximum amount for which the
Indemnifying Party is potentially liable with respect to such Third Party
Claim, (D) the Indemnified Partys counsel advises that a conflict of interest
exists or would reasonably be expected to arise in the event the Indemnifying
Party elects to control or defend any Third-Party Claim, (E) the Indemnifying
Party has failed or is failing to defend in good faith such Third Party Claim,
(F) such Third-Party Claim arises out of any Release of any Hazardous Material
or noncompliance with any Environmental Law at any Real Property or (G) such
Third Party Claim arises out of or relates to any Intellectual Property
constituting a Transferred Asset. If, in the reasonable opinion of the
Indemnifying Partys outside counsel, the equitable relief or other relief
portion of the Third-Party Claim referenced in clause (B) above can be
separated from the claim for money damages without prejudicial effect (other
than a _de minimis_ prejudicial effect) on the non-monetary claims, then,
with the prior written consent of the applicable Indemnified Party (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the portion of such claim
relating to money damages. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
settle, compromise or discharge a Third-Party Claim either (I) with the prior
written consent of the applicable Indemnified Party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or (II) without any Indemnified
Partys consent if such settlement, compromise or discharge (x) provides for
no relief other than the 

 



109

    

 payment of monetary damages and such monetary damages are paid in full by
the Indemnifying Party, (y) includes as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the Person(s) asserting such Third-Party Claim to all Indemnified
Parties of an unconditional release from all liability with respect to such
Third-Party Claim and (z) does not contain an admission of liability on the
part of any Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to
the entry of any judgment which would impose any injunctive or equitable
relief on the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Indemnifying Party elects not to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the relevant Indemnified Parties and assume control of such defense within
thirty (30) Business Days of receipt of written notice of such Third Party
Claim or if both the Indemnifying Party and any Indemnified Party are parties
to or subjects of such Action and conflicts of interests exist between the
Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Parties
shall retain counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party in
connection with such Action and assume control of the defense of the
Indemnified Parties in connection with such Action, and the fees, charges and
disbursements of no more than one such counsel per jurisdiction selected by
the Indemnified Parties shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party.
Whether the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party controls the defense
of any Third-Party Claim, the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense
thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.02(c)_. Under no circumstances
will the Indemnifying Party have any liability in connection with any
settlement of any Third-Party Claim that is entered into without its prior
written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

(c) From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice, at the reasonable request
of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified Party shall grant
the Indemnifying Party and its Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours, to the books, records, personnel and properties of the
Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably related to the Claim Notice at no
cost to the Indemnifying Party (other than for reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket expenses of the Indemnified Parties); _provided_ that the
Indemnifying Party shall take reasonable precautions so as not to jeopardize
any privilege reasonably available to an Indemnified Party in respect of any
of its records.

(d) In the event of a Direct Claim, within thirty (30) days of delivery of a
Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party, if the Indemnifying Party disputes its
liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of
such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be
resolved by litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 12.10_.

 

Section 11.03 _No Duplication; Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(a) Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without
duplication of recovery (i) by reason of the state of facts giving rise to
such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement (and for purposes of clarity there shall be no
liability for a breach of any covenant where the primary purpose of such
covenant is to maintain the truth or correctness of any representation or
warranty or of notifying a party about any untruth or incorrectness of any
representation or warranty other than what is available for the breach of such
underlying representation or warranty) or (ii) to the extent such liability
was already taken into account under _Section_ __ _ 2.04_.

(b) From and after the Closing and except (i) as expressly provided in
_Section_ __ _ 2.04_, (ii) in the case where a party seeks to obtain specific
performance pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.13_, (iii) for claims arising out
of fraud, and (iv) for claims related to or arising under the terms of the
Ancillary Agreements, which shall be governed by the terms of such Ancillary
Agreements, the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties in connection with
any and all claims under this Amended Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including any Losses from claims for breach of contract,
warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and whether
predicated on strict liability, common law or any other Law) shall be as
provided in this _Article XI_.

 



110

    

Section 11.04 _Limitation on Set-Off_. 

(a) Purchaser shall not have any right to set off any unresolved
indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article XI_ against, and there shall
not otherwise be any right to set off or counterclaim in the event of the non-
performance of any obligation to make, (i) any payment due pursuant to
_Article II_ , (ii) any payment due under the Transition Services Agreement
or any other Ancillary Agreement, or (iii) any payment due pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.04(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.12(d)_.

 

(b) Seller shall not have any right to set off any unresolved indemnification
claim pursuant to _Article XI_ against, and there shall not otherwise be any
right to set off or counterclaim in the event of the non-performance of any
obligation to make, (i) any payment due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.04_,
(ii) any payment due under the Transition Services Agreement or any other
Ancillary Agreement, or (iii) any payment due pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.04(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.12(d)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 10.02(c)_.

Section 11.05 _Mitigation_.

 

(a) Purchaser and Seller shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to) cooperate with each other in good faith with respect to resolving any
claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated to indemnify
the other party under this _Article XI_ , including by making commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate to the extent required by Law, whether
by seeking claims against a third party, an insurer or otherwise, and to
resolve any such claim or liability. Purchaser shall not have any obligation
to commence any Action against any insurer or third party to mitigate or
resolve any claim.

 

(b) No party shall be liable under this _Article XI_ for Losses consisting of
exemplary, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, remote, speculative,
punitive or treble damages, lost profits or internal costs; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this sentence shall not limit a partys right to recover
under this _Article XI_ for any such Losses to the extent (x) in the case of
exemplary or punitive damages, such Losses are actually awarded in connection
with a Third-Party Claim or (y) in the case of consequential, special or
indirect damages, lost profits or diminution in value, such Losses are (A)
reasonably foreseeable or (B) actually awarded in connection with a Third-
Party Claim.

Section 11.06 _Potential Contributors_. If an Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of Losses and the Indemnified
Party could have recovered all or a part of such Losses from a third party
based on the underlying claim or demand asserted against such Indemnifying
Party, then such Indemnified Party shall transfer such of its rights to
proceed against such third party as are necessary to permit such Indemnifying
Party to recover from such third party the amount of such payment.

Section 11.07 _Tax Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnified Persons against and hold them harmless from any Losses arising
from, relating to or otherwise in respect of, except as provided in _Section_
__ _ 11.07(b)_, (i) any Taxes imposed on the Business or the Transferred
Entities with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including as a result of
the Pre-Closing Restructuring), (ii) any Taxes that are Retained Liabilities
hereunder, (iii) any Taxes imposed on a Transferred Entity (including any
Taxes imposed under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any corresponding
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law) as a result of its inclusion
with Seller, any

 



111

    

 Subsidiary Transferor or any other Person (other than a Transferred Entity)
in a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax group, for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, (iv) any Taxes for which a Transferred Entity, Purchaser or any
Affiliate of Purchaser is liable as a transferee or successor or by Contract
(other than Contracts that do not primarily relate to Taxes), in each case, to
the extent such Taxes are attributable to the operation of the Business or
ownership of the Transferred Assets prior to the Closing, (v) any Taxes
attributable to any "subpart F income" (including any increase thereto under
Section 965 of the Code) required to be included in income in a Post-Closing
Tax Period solely to the extent such subpart F income is attributable to
income or earnings of a Transferred Entity for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period (determined in accordance with the principles set forth in _Section_
__ _ 8.03(a)_), but excluding any such inclusion that is attributable to
actions taken by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates after the Closing, (vi)
any Taxes attributable to any breach or violation of any of Sellers
representations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.15_, (vii) any German Trade Tax
imposed on Paula Grundstucksverwaltungsgesellschaft mbH and Co. Vermietungs KG
resulting from capital gains or profits triggered by the sale of the limited

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser and the Transferred Entities
shall, jointly and severally, indemnify the Seller Indemnified Persons and

the Transferred Entities (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, as
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)(vi)_) with respect to any Post-
Closing Tax Period, except to the extent such Taxes are attributable to a
breach of any representation set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.15(k)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 4.15(l)_ or any inaccuracy in _Section_ __ _ 4.15(h)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter (as such Section of the Seller Disclosure Letter may
be revised pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.06(c)_), (ii) any Taxes taken into
account in the adjustment described in _Section_ __ _ 2.04_, (iii) any

pursuant to _Article VIII_ , and (iv) any Transfer Taxes for which Purchaser
is liable under _Section_ __ _ 8.01_, _provided_ that this  _Section_ __ _
11.07(b)_ shall not be construed as limiting any indemnity set forth in clause
_ (v)_ of _Section_ __ _ 11.07(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.07(b)(i)_ shall
not be construed as limiting any indemnity set forth in clause _(vii)_ of
_Section_ __ _ 11.07(a)_.

(c) Procedures Relating to Tax Controversies.

(i) Promptly after a party (the " _Tax Indemnified Party_ ") becomes aware of
the existence of a Tax Proceeding that may give rise to an indemnification
claim under this _Section_ __ _ 11.07_ (a " _Tax Controversy_ ") by it
against the other party (the " _Tax Indemnifying Party_ "), the Tax
Indemnified Party shall notify the Tax Indemnifying Party of the Tax issue
and thereafter shall promptly forward to the Tax Indemnifying Party copies of
the relevant portion of any notice or other document received from any Tax
Authority and communications with any Tax Authority relating to such Tax
Controversy; _provided_ , _however_ , that a failure to give such notice will
not affect such other partys rights to indemnification under this _Article
XI_ , except to the extent that such party is actually prejudiced thereby.

(ii) After the Closing Date, Seller shall control the conduct, through counsel
of its own choosing, of any Tax Controversy with respect to any of the
Transferred Entities or the Transferred Assets with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Periods to the extent such Tax Controversy could reasonably be expected
to result in any indemnification obligations pursuant to _Section_ __ _
11.07(a)_, _provided_ , _however_ , that, except in the case of a Tax
Controversy with respect to a Combined Tax Return, (A) Purchaser shall have
the right to participate in such Tax Controversy at its own expense, (B)
Seller shall not settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such Tax
Controversy that is reasonably

 



112

    

 expected to result in material adverse tax consequences to Purchaser without
obtaining Purchasers written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned, and (C) Seller shall keep Purchaser
reasonably informed as to the progress of any such Tax Controversy and shall
consider in good faith any written comments or suggestions provided by
Purchaser regarding such Tax Controversy.

 

(iii) To the extent that any provision in this _Section_ __ _ 11.07(c)_ may
overlap or conflict with any provision contained in _Section_ __ _ 11.02_,
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 11.07(c)_ shall govern.

(d) For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 11.07_, all Losses in respect of
Taxes shall be reduced by (i) any indemnity, contribution or other similar
payment actually paid to Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person by any
third party with respect to such Loss, and (ii) an amount equal to any net
reduction of income Taxes of Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person
attributable to a Tax benefit actually realized in the year of such loss or
the immediately succeeding two (2) taxable years as a direct result of such
Loss.

(e) Sellers indemnity obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 11.07_ shall
survive until the date that is sixty (60) days from the date of the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitation (including all periods of extension,
whether automatic or permissive), and such indemnity obligations shall not be
subject to any of the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.01(b)_.

(f) In no event shall the Purchaser Indemnified Persons be entitled to
recover, any Loss attributable to Taxes of any of the Transferred Entities (i)
for any taxable period that is not a Pre-Closing Tax Period, except to the
extent such Taxes are attributable to a breach of any representation set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 4.15(k)_ or _Section_ __ _ 4.15(l)_ or any inaccuracy in
Section 4.15(h) of the Seller Disclosure Letter (as such Section of the
Seller Disclosure Letter may be revised pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.06(c)_),
(ii) as a result of any transaction occurring on the Closing Date after the
Closing outside the ordinary course of business, (iii) as a result of
Purchasers financing of the transactions provided for in this Amended
Agreement, (iv) to the extent such Taxes are not actually paid, or due and
payable, to the relevant Governmental Authority or (v) due to the
unavailability in any Post-Closing Tax Period of any net operating losses,
credits or other Tax attribute from a Pre-Closing Tax Period, _provided_ that
this  _Section_ __ _ 11.07(f)_ shall not be construed as limiting any
indemnity set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.07(a)(v)_ and _Section_ __ _
11.07(f)(i)_ shall not be construed as limiting any indemnity set forth in
clause _ (vii)_ of _Section_ __ _ 11.07(a)_.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any failure of a party to

for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or

rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates or (ii)
designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder,
in each case, if Purchaser nonetheless remains fully responsible for the
performance of their respective obligations hereunder and (b) Purchaser may
assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations to any Financing Source
as collateral in connection with the Debt Financing and any Financing Source
may exercise all of the rights and remedies of Purchaser hereunder
in connection with the enforcement of any security or exercise of any
remedies to the extent permitted under the Debt Financing documentation. Any
transfer in violation of this _Section_ __ _ 12.07_ __ shall be null and
void.

 

Section 12.08 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Amended Agreement is for
the sole benefit of the parties and their permitted assigns, and nothing
herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other

12.08_,  _Section_ __ _ 12.09_, _Section_ __ _ 12.10_, _Section_ __ _

Section 12.10 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Amended Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and any dispute
arising out of or relating to or in connection with this Amended Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

 

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each party hereto (i)
agrees that any claim, action or proceeding by such party seeking any relief
whatsoever arising out of, relating to or in connection with, this Amended
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby shall be brought only in the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware in and for New Castle County, Delaware (unless the federal courts
have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter, in which case the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware) and not in any other State or
Federal court in the United States of America or any court in any other
country, (ii) agrees to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts
located in for purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of, or in
connection with, this Amended Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) waives and agrees not to assert any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such Action brought in such a court or any claim that any such Action brought
in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, and (iv) agrees
that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or
proceeding in the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 12.03_ or any other
manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service
thereof; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary in this Amended Agreement, each Seller Related Party and each of the
other parties hereto (including each parties Affiliates) (A) agrees that it
will not bring or support, or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or
support, any Action of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the Financing Sources
arising out of, or relating to, the transactions contemplated by this Amended
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, the Debt Financing Commitment, the Debt
Financing or the performance of services thereunder or related thereto in any
forum other than the state or federal court sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan, New York, New York, and any appellate court thereof and each Person
party hereto submits for itself and its property with respect to any such
Action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court and (B) agrees that any
such Action shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws
of the State of New York without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such
State that would result in the application of the laws of any other State. The
preceding sentence shall not limit the jurisdiction of the Accounting
Arbitrator set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.04_, although claims may be
asserted in such courts described in the preceding sentence for purposes of
enforcing the jurisdiction and judgments of the Accounting Arbitrator.

 

Section 12.11 _Counterparts_. This Amended Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, and by the different parties in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Amended Agreement
by facsimile or other electronic means (including portable document format)
shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
Amended Agreement.

 

Section 12.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may
have to a trial by jury in respect to any litigation, claim, suit or
proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, directly or indirectly, arising out of
or relating to this Amended

 



116

    

 Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this Amended Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements, the Acquisition, the Debt Financing or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including any such action,
proceeding or counterclaim involving any Financing Sources). Each party (a)
certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the
event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges
that it and the other parties have been induced to enter into this Amended
Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications
in this _Section_ __ _ 12.12_.

Section 12.13 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Amended Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached and that any breach of this Amended Agreement could not be adequately
compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone. The parties acknowledge
and agree that, prior to the valid termination of this Amended Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.01_, the parties shall be entitled to obtain an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Amended Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court as specified in
_Section_ __ _ 12.10_, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each party agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that any the other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
Law or in equity. No Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Amended Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Amended Agreement shall be required to provide any
bond or other security in connection with such order or injunction.

 

Section 12.14 _No Presumption_. The parties to this Amended Agreement agree
that this Amended Agreement was negotiated fairly between them at arms
length and that the final terms of this Amended Agreement are the product of
the parties negotiations. Each party represents and warrants that it has
sought and received legal counsel of its own choosing with regard to the
contents of this Amended Agreement and the rights and obligations affected
hereby. The parties agree that this Amended Agreement shall be deemed to have
been jointly and equally drafted by them, and that the provisions of this
Amended Agreement therefore should not be construed against a party or
parties on the grounds that the party or parties drafted or was more
responsible for drafting the provisions.

 

Section 12.15 _Waiver of Claims Against the Financing Sources_. None of the
Financing Sources will have any liability to the Business or its Affiliates
relating to or arising out of this Amended Agreement, the Debt Financing or
otherwise, whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and
neither the Business nor any of its Affiliates will have any rights or claims
against any of the Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder.
