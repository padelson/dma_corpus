the Adjustment Amount), then the Adjustment Amount, if any, produced pursuant to
Section 2.2(b) above based upon the Adjustment Amount Schedule shall be deemed
conclusive, final and binding on the parties. If Solectron gives such written
notice of objection, then the issues in dispute will be submitted to Ernst &
Young LLP, certified public accountants (the "Accountants"), for resolution. If
issues in dispute are submitted to the Accountants for resolution, (i) each
party will furnish to the Accountants such workpapers and other documents and
information relating to the disputed issues as the Accountants may request and

afforded the opportunity to present to the Accountants any material relating to
the determination and to discuss the determination with the Accountants; (ii)
the determination by the Accountants, as set forth in a notice delivered to both
parties by the Accountants, will be binding and conclusive on the parties.

          (d) (i) Purchaser shall pay that portion of the fees of the
Accountants equal to the fraction, the numerator of which is the difference
between the Dy 4 Systems' calculation of the Adjustment Amount, minus the
Accountants final calculation of the Adjustment Amount, and the denominator of

Amount, minus Solectron's calculation of the Adjustment Amount, and (ii)

affiliates) related to or arising out of any Environmental Laws. No Dy 4 Entity

moveable or fixed) or other containers, either temporary or permanent, or
deposited or located in land, water, sumps, or any other part of the Real
Property or such adjoining property, or incorporated into any structure therein
or thereon, except the presence of which would not be reasonably likely to
result in a material liability to any Dy 4 Entity. Neither Sellers nor a Dy 4
Entity, nor any other Person for whose conduct a Dy 4 Entity is or may be held
responsible under Law or by contract or agreement, nor to the knowledge of
Sellers or any Dy 4 Entity, any other Person, has permitted or conducted, or is

mixed) in which a Dy 4 Entity has or had an interest, except as would not be
reasonably likely to result in a material Liability to any Dy 4 Entity.

          (f) Except as would not be reasonably likely to result in a material
Liability to any Dy 4 Entity, there has been no Release or, to the knowledge of
Sellers or any Dy 4 Entity, Threat of Release, of any Hazardous Materials at or
from the Real Property or, to the knowledge of Sellers and each Dy 4 Entity, at

conduct a Dy 4 Entity is responsible under Law or by contract or agreement, with
Environmental Laws.

has in full force and effect all Permits and other approvals required to be

accurate list of all "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of 'SS'3(3)
of ERISA, all material bonus, stock option, stock purchase, incentive, deferred
compensation, supplemental retirement, severance and other employee benefit
plans, programs or arrangements, and all material employment or compensation
agreements, in each case for the benefit of, or relating to, current employees
and/or former employees of the Dy 4 Entities (collectively, the "Employee
Plans"). All Employee Plans (and each related trust, insurance contract or fund)
have been maintained, funded and administered, in all material respects, in
accordance with their terms and in compliance in all material respects with the
requirements prescribed by applicable Law, and the Dy 4 Entities have performed
all material obligations required to be performed by any of them under, and are
not in any material respect in violation of the terms of, any of the Employee
Plans. Each Employee Plan which is intended to meet the requirements of section
401(a) of the Code has received a determination letter from the IRS that such
Employee Plan is so qualified and no facts or circumstances exist that could
likely result in the loss of such qualified status. There have been no
prohibited transactions (as defined in section 406 of ERISA and section 4975 of
the Code) with respect to any Employee Plan or any Employee Plan maintained by
an ERISA Affiliate, excluding transactions effected in compliance with an
enforceable statutory or administrative exemption pursuant to section 408 of
ERISA. To the knowledge of Sellers or any Dy 4 Entities, no fiduciary has any
liability for material breach of fiduciary duty or any other material failure to
act or comply in connection with the administration or the investment of the
assets of any Employee Plan. No Action, proceeding,


                                      -22-




<PAGE>

hearing, or investigation with respect to the administration or the investment
of the assets of any Employee Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) is
pending or, to the knowledge of Sellers or any Dy 4 Entity, Threatened. No Dy 4
Entity contributes to, or has any obligation to contribute to, or has any
material liability under or with respect to any Employee Plan that is a "defined
benefit plan" (as defined in section 3(35) of ERISA). For each Employee Plan
that is sponsored by a Dy 4 Entity, Dy 4 Systems has, or has caused to be, made
available to Purchaser copies of: (i) each Employee Plan and summary plan
description of each Employee Plan; (ii) the most recent annual actuarial
valuations, if any, prepared for each Employee Plan; (iii) if the Employee Plan
is funded, the most recent annual and periodic accounting of Employee Plan
assets; (iv) the most recent determination letter received from the IRS with
respect to any Employee Plan that is intended to be a qualified plan under
section 401(a) of the Code; (v) the most recent annual report (Form 5500) with
applicable attachments; and (vi) all trust agreements, insurance contracts and
other funding arrangements which are related to any Employee Plan. For each
Employee Plan, Dy 4 Systems has, or has caused to be, made available to
Purchaser a copy of a summary plan description of each Employee Plan.

          (b) There are no Employee Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code. No Dy 4 Entity or any ERISA Affiliate, contributes to,
has any obligation to contribute to, or has any material Liability (including
withdrawal liability as defined in section 4201 of ERISA) under or with respect
to any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in section 3(37) of ERISA).

          (c) No Employee Plan provides, or reflects or represents any Liability
or potential Liability to provide post-termination or retiree welfare benefits
to any person for any reason, except as may be required by COBRA or other
applicable Law. The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not (either alone or upon termination of
employment following such transactions) constitute an event under any Employee
Plan that will or may result in any payment (whether of severance pay or
otherwise), forgiveness of indebtedness or accelerated vesting with respect to
any current employees or former employees of the Dy 4 Entities. No payment or
benefit which will or may be made by a Dy 4 Entity with respect to any
"disqualified individual" in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (as defined in Code Section 280G and the regulations thereunder)
is reasonably likely to be characterized as a "parachute payment," within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code.

          (d) With respect to each employee benefit plan (as such term is
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that any ERISA Affiliate maintains, to which
any of them contributes or has any obligation to contribute, or with respect to
which any of them has any Liability or potential Liability:

               (i) no such employee benefit plan that is an "Employee Pension
Benefit Plan", as defined in section 3(2) of ERISA that is subject to Title IV
of ERISA (other than a "Multiemployer Plan" as defined in section 3(37) of
ERISA), has been completely or partially terminated or been the subject of a
"reportable event" within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA. No proceeding by
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") to terminate any such Employee
Pension Benefit Plan (other than any Multiemployer Plan) has been instituted or
Threatened. The market value of the assets under each such employee benefit plan
that is an


                                      -23-




<PAGE>

Employee Pension Benefit Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan) equals or
exceeds the present value of all vested and non-vested Liabilities thereunder
determined in accordance with PBGC methods, factors, and assumptions applicable
to an Employee Pension Benefit Plan terminating on the date of determination.

               (ii) none of the Dy 4 Entities has incurred, and Parent does not
expect that any Dy 4 Entity will incur, any Liabilities to the PBGC (other than
with respect to any PBGC premiums not yet due) or otherwise under Title IV of
ERISA or under the Code with respect to any such employee benefit plan which is
an Employee Pension Benefit Plan.

     Section 4.20. Taxes.

          (a) Except to the extent that any failure does not have a Material
Adverse Effect, (i) all material Tax Returns required to be filed with respect
to the Dy 4 Entities have been timely filed and were correct and complete in all
material respects, (ii) all Taxes shown due and owing on such Tax Returns have
been paid, (iii) no Dy 4 Entity is currently the beneficiary of any extension of
time to file any Tax Return, (iv) no material adjustment relating to any of such
Tax Returns has been proposed formally or, to the knowledge of Dy 4 Systems or
Dy 4 (US), informally by any Tax authority, and (v) no Dy 4 Entity has any
actual or potential liability for any Tax obligation of any taxpayer (including
without limitation any Affiliated Group) other than the Dy 4 Entities, including
any obligation under any tax allocation or sharing agreement, under Section
1.1502-6 of the Regulations or any similar provision of Law, as a transferee or
successor, by contract, or otherwise. No representation or warranty is made
regarding the availability or utility of Tax Attributes or the amount thereof.

not exceed that reserve as adjusted for operations and transactions through the
Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of the Dy 4
Entities in filing their Tax Returns.

          (d) No Dy 4 Entity will be required to include any item of income in,

record books, and other records of each Dy 4 Entity, all of which have been made
available to the Purchaser, are complete and correct in all material respects.
The books of account and financial records of each Dy 4 Entity represent actual,
bona fide transactions and have been maintained in accordance with sound
business practices, including the maintenance of an adequate system of internal
controls. All of these books and records are and at Closing will be in the
possession of the respective Dy 4 Entity.

     Section 4.23. Certain Payments. Since December 31, 2001, neither a Dy 4
Entity nor, to Sellers' or any Dy 4 Entity's knowledge, any director, officer,
agent, or employee of a Dy 4 Entity, or any other Person associated with or
acting for or on behalf of a Dy 4 Entity, has directly or indirectly (a) made
any contribution, gift, bribe, rebate, payoff, influence payment, kickback, or
other payment to any Person, private or public, regardless of form, whether in
money, property, or services (i) to obtain favorable treatment in securing
business for a Dy 4 Entity, (ii) to pay for favorable treatment for business
secured for a Dy 4 Entity, (iii) to obtain special concessions or for special
concessions already obtained, for or in respect of a Dy 4 Entity, or (iv) in
violation of any Law for the benefit of or on behalf of a Dy 4 Entity, or (b)
established or maintained any fund or asset for the benefit or on behalf of a Dy
4 Entity that has not been recorded in the books and records of a Dy 4 Entity.

     Section 4.24. Relationships With Related Persons. No Related Person of a Dy
4 Entity has any interest in any of the Assets. No Related Person of a Dy 4
Entity owns (of record or as a beneficial owner), an equity interest or any
other financial or profit interest in, a Person that has (a) had material
business dealings or a material financial interest in any transaction with a Dy
4 Entity, or (b) engaged in direct competition with a Dy 4 Entity with respect
to any line of services of a Dy 4 Entity, other than for non-material interests
in a publicly traded company. Except (i) as set forth in Section 4.24 of the
Disclosure Schedule, (ii) as will be paid at or prior to Closing as set forth in
Section 6.16, or (iii) as compensation to employees in the ordinary course of
business, no Related Person of a Dy 4 Entity is a party to any Material Contract
with, or has any claim or right against, a Dy 4 Entity. No Related Person of a
Dy 4 Entity has any outstanding loans, or guarantees of

indebtedness, from a Dy 4 Entity (other than travel and expense advances
incurred in accordance with existing established policies of the Dy 4 Entities
and in the ordinary course of business).

     Section 4.25. Labor Relations; Compliance.

          (a) No Dy 4 Entity has been nor is a party to any collective
bargaining or other labor contract. There has not been, there is not presently
pending or existing, and to Sellers' or any Dy 4 Entity's knowledge, there is
not Threatened, (i) any strike, slowdown, picketing, work stoppage, or employee
grievance process, (ii) any Action against or affecting a Dy 4 Entity relating
to the alleged violation of any Law pertaining to labor relations or employment

the National Labor Relations Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
or any comparable Governmental Authority, organizational activity, or other
labor or employment dispute against or affecting a Dy 4 Entity or its premises,
except as would not result in material liability to the Dy 4 Entities, or (iii)
any application for certification of a collective bargaining agent. To the
Sellers' or any Dy 4 Entity's knowledge, no event has occurred or circumstance
exists that could provide the basis for any work stoppage or other labor
dispute. There is no lockout of any employees by a Dy 4 Entity, and no such
action is contemplated by a Dy 4 Entity. Each Dy 4 Entity has complied in all
material respects with all Laws relating to employment, employment practices,
terms and conditions of employment, equal employment opportunity,
nondiscrimination, immigration, wages, hours, benefits, collective bargaining,
the payment of withholding, social security and similar Taxes, occupational
safety and health, and plant closing in each case with respect to their current

of Sellers or any Dy 4 Entity, has any complaint been Threatened or filed by any
Dy 4 Systems employee which has not been resolved claiming that Dy 4 Systems has

Code (Ontario) or any applicable employee or human rights or similar legislation
in this or the other jurisdictions in which Dy 4 Systems operates, or of any
complaints or proceedings which might not have been resolved, of any kind
involving Dy 4 Systems, to the Sellers' or Dy 4 Systems' knowledge, after due
inquiry, by any Dy 4 Systems employee before any labor relations board.

          (c) There are no outstanding orders or charges or, to the knowledge of
Sellers' or any Dy 4 Entity, potential or Threatened orders or charges against
Dy 4 Systems under the Occupational Health and Safety Act (Ontario) (or any

4 Systems carries on its Business).

          (d) All complaints, appeals, premiums, levies, assessments and
penalties required to be paid by Dy 4 Systems pursuant to the Workers'
Compensation Act (Ontario) and/or the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act

and may include carrybacks of net operating losses and other Tax attributes to

          (m) agree to do any of the foregoing.

     Section 6.2. Access to Information. Subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, from the date hereof until the Closing, upon
reasonable notice, each of Dy 4 Systems and Dy 4 (US) shall, and shall cause
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives,
accountants and counsel to, afford the officers, employees and authorized
agents, representatives, accountants, counsel and any debt financing sources of
Purchaser reasonable (but non-intrusive) access, during normal business hours
upon reasonable notice, to the offices, properties, plants, other facilities,
books and records of each Dy 4 Entity and to those officers, directors,
employees, agents, representatives, accountants and counsel of the Dy 4 Entities
who have any knowledge relating to the Business, Assets, financial condition and
operations of each of the Dy 4 Entities; provided, however, that Purchaser and
its officers, employees and authorized agents, representatives, accountants,
counsel and financing sources shall not unreasonably interfere with the business
and operations of the Dy 4 Entities.

     Section 6.3. Confidentiality. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
are hereby incorporated herein by reference and shall continue in full force and
effect until the Closing, at which time, except as set forth below, such
Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of the parties under this Section

Confidentiality Agreement (Non-Solicitation) shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms and (ii) the Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate only in respect of that portion of the Evaluation Material (as defined

     Section 6.4. Nonsolicitation. Each of the Sellers agrees that, from the
Closing Date through July 29, 2005, they shall not, and shall cause their
affiliates not to, solicit to employ (or entertain a solicitation to be employed

                                      -31-




<PAGE>

Entity, so long as they are employed by any Dy 4 Entity, without obtaining the
prior written consent of the Purchaser; provided, however, Sellers or their
affiliates shall not be precluded from hiring such officer, director or employee
who (i) has been terminated by the Dy 4 Entity prior to commencement of
employment discussions between any Seller or its affiliate and such officer,
director or employee, or (ii) is responding, on his or her own initiative, to a
general advertisement for employment not directed at any Dy 4 Entity.

     Section 6.5. Regulatory Authorizations. Each of the parties hereto shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all authorizations, consents,
orders and approvals of all Governmental Authorities that may be or become
necessary for the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions and shall
cooperate fully with each other in promptly seeking to obtain all such
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals. Each party hereto shall make an
appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act and, if necessary, the Competition
Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement promptly
after the date hereof and shall supply as promptly as practicable to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested or required pursuant to the HSR Act and the
Competition Act. Each party hereto shall make any required filing(s), if
necessary, pursuant to the applicable foreign antitrust regulations, including
without limitation the Competition Act, with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement promptly after the date hereof and shall supply

additional information and documentary material that may be requested or
required pursuant thereto. Purchaser and Solectron shall share equally all
filing fees related to compliance with HSR and the Competition Act.

use reasonable efforts to obtain all such third party consents and estoppel

any fee or make any payment to obtain any such consent or estoppel certificate).
Purchaser shall cooperate and use reasonable efforts to assist the Sellers and
the Dy 4 Entities in obtaining such consents and estoppel certificates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser understands and agrees that the
procurement of any such third party consents and estoppel certificates
(regardless of whether any such consent or estoppel certificate is identified on
Section 4.5 of the Disclosure Schedule) is not a condition to Purchaser's
obligation to effect the Closing.

     Section 6.7. Conveyance Taxes. Purchaser shall be liable for and shall hold
Sellers harmless against any transfer, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees, and any similar Taxes and fees

action, do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law, and execute and deliver such documents and other papers, as may
reasonably be required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and


                                      -32-

consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and to vest in Purchaser good and valid title to the Shares.

     Section 6.9. Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification. For a
period of seven (7) years after the Closing, Purchaser shall not, and shall
cause each Dy 4 Entity not to amend, repeal or modify any provision in its
certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar governing documents) or
pursuant to other instruments of agreements in effect on the date hereof
relating to the exculpation or indemnification of present and former officers
and directors of the Dy 4 Entities (unless required by Law or the rules of any
stock exchange or self-regulatory organization), it being the intent of the
parties that such officers and directors of the Dy 4 Entities prior to the
Closing shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and indemnification
after the Closing Date to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. The parties agree
that Purchaser shall purchase directors and officers liability insurance
coverage for purposes of indemnifying and insuring persons covered by such
insurance of the Dy 4 Entities, as the case may be, immediately prior to the
Closing Date, which coverage shall be on terms and in amounts at least as
favorable to such persons as they were on the Closing Date.

     Section 6.10. Contact with Customers and Suppliers. Purchaser and its
representatives shall contact and communicate with the employees, customers,
suppliers, licensees and licensors of the Dy 4 Entities in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby only with the prior written consent of
Solectron (or its designee, as evidenced by a writing delivered to Purchaser by
Solectron), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned except that such consent may be conditioned upon a designee of
Solectron being present at any such meeting or conference.

     Section 6.11. Employees.

          (a) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the
one-year anniversary of the Closing Date (or such longer period as may be
required by the terms of any collective bargaining agreement or applicable law)
(the "Continuation Period"), Purchaser shall provide, or cause the Dy 4 Entities
to provide, those persons employed by the Dy 4 Entities immediately prior to the
Closing, including those employees on vacation, leave of absence, disability or
sick leave or layoff, and, where applicable, their eligible dependents (whether
or not such employees return to active employment with such Dy 4 Entity) (the
"Transferred Employees"), with employee benefits and base pay that are
substantially equivalent to, or more favorable than, the benefits and base pay
that such Transferred Employees received or were entitled to receive under the
Employee Plans immediately prior to the Closing. Purchaser shall also maintain
the employee benefit plans of the Dy 4 Entities identified in Section 6.11(a) of
the Disclosure Schedule for applicable Transferred Employees participating in
such plans immediately prior to Closing (subject to the terms of such plans)
through the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date, and shall make such
payments as are required by such plans. During the Continuation Period or such

dental and other health and welfare plans to (i) waive any preexisting condition
limitations for conditions covered under the applicable medical, dental or other
health or welfare plans of the Dy 4 Entities (the "Welfare Plans") and any

substantially equivalent or more favorable benefits than those received (or
entitled to receive) under the Employee Plans prior to the Closing Date and will
continue to maintain and sponsor such benefit plans through at least the
one-year anniversary of the

benefit of employees of the Dy 4 Entities based in Canada and will permit such
employees to transfer, where applicable, their account balances from the DC Plan
and RRSP(s) of Sellers or their Affiliates to such RRSP or DC Plan of Purchaser.
The transfers described herein shall comply with applicable Law, and each party
shall make all filings and take any actions required of such party by applicable
Law in connection therewith. To the extent permitted by Law, participants in the
RRSP(s) of Sellers or their Affiliates shall be given full service credit for
all service with the Dy 4 Entities for purposes of eligibility and vesting under
the RRSP or DC Plan of Purchaser.

Indemnified Parties for reductions in net operating loss carryovers, Tax credits

applicable Law by reason of net operating loss carryovers, Tax credits and
similar Tax attributes arising in the Pre-Closing Period (assuming for the
purposes of this sentence that such attributes are not used to reduce Taxes in
the Post-Closing Period).

     Section 7.2. Tax Return Filing.

          (a) Except as set forth in Section 7.2(b) Purchaser shall control and
be responsible for the filing of all Tax Returns required to be filed with

thirty (30) days of receiving such notice; provided, however, that Purchaser's
failure to provide such notice shall not release Solectron from any
indemnification obligation hereunder unless Solectron loses its right to contest
such Tax Contest as a result of such failure to notify. Solectron shall have the
right to control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest, provided,
however, that Solectron may decline to participate in such Tax Contest. If
Solectron controls the conduct of such Tax Contest, Solectron regularly shall
advise Purchaser of the status of such Tax Contest and shall not resolve such
Tax Contest, to the extent such Tax Contest relates to Post-Closing Period
Taxes, without Purchaser's written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld. If Solectron declines to control
such Tax Contest, then the Purchaser shall have the right to control the conduct
of such Tax Contest, provided, however, that Purchaser shall regularly advise
Solectron of the status of such Tax Contest and shall

<PAGE>

not resolve such Tax Contest without Solectron's written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld. Each party shall
bear its own costs for participating in such Tax Contest, subject to any
indemnification provided under Section 7.1.

          (b) In the event of a dispute between Solectron and Purchaser
regarding the conduct or resolution of any Tax Contest or claim for
indemnification under this Article VII, such dispute shall be referred to a Tax
Arbitrator. The decision of the Tax Arbitrator shall be final and binding, and
its fees and costs shall be shared equally by the disputing parties. Each party
shall bear its own costs for participating in such dispute resolution.

          (c) Any net refunds and credits attributable to the payment of Taxes
for a Pre-Closing Period shall be for the account of Solectron.

          (d) To the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this Section
7.3, the procedures of Article X shall apply in the case of any claim for Losses
related to Taxes.

information, records, and documents relating to Taxes concerning the Dy 4
Entities, including information required by Solectron for Tax Returns required

          (c) retain any books and records that could reasonably be expected to

Purchaser will treat the purchase of the Dy 4 (US) Shares hereunder as a deemed
sale of assets by Dy 4 (US), pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code, and

Purchaser shall mutually agree following the Closing on the allocation of
Purchase Price between the Dy 4 (US) Shares and Dy 4 Systems Shares and on the
allocation of Purchase Price among the assets of Dy 4 (US), and shall jointly
prepare and timely file IRS Form 8023 in connection with the Section 338(h)(10)

Closing, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
Purchaser contained herein or in any document delivered by Purchaser pursuant
hereto, or (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of
Purchaser contained or compliance after the Closing with any of the agreements
or conditions of Dy 4 Systems or Dy 4 (US) contained herein. Any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by
Solectron.

          (b) Purchaser may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of any Seller or Dy 4 Entity (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of a Dy 4 Entity, or any
Seller contained herein or in any document delivered by a Dy 4 Entity or any
Seller pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions of a Dy 4 Entity or any Seller contained herein. Any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by
Purchaser.

          (c) Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed as a
waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or
condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition, of this Agreement. The
failure of any party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute
a waiver of any of such rights.

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

     Section 10.1. Survival of Representations and Warranties.

          (a) All representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement
shall expire and terminate on the date that is eighteen months after the Closing
Date; provided, however, that the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 4.14 and Section 4.19 shall expire on the date that is 27 months after
the Closing Date; provided, further, that the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 4.20 shall expire one month after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations relating thereto (the date of such applicable
expiration, a "Termination Date"); provided, further, that the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 3.1, Section 3.4, Section 4.1, Section 4.2,
Section 4.3, and Section 4.4 shall not expire. Except as provided in the
preceding sentence and except for any breach of any covenant which requires
performance beyond the Termination Date (except in each case as a result of any
changes contemplated or permitted by this Agreement), the obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless any Person pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i) or Section
10.2(b)(i) or Section 7.1 shall terminate on the Termination Date; provided that
such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate as to any
item with respect to which the person to be indemnified shall have, prior to the
Termination Date, delivered to the indemnifying party a bona fide Officer's
Certificate or, in the event of a Third Party Proceeding, given notice to the
indemnifying party of such Third Party Proceeding in accordance with Section
10.4. References herein to the "indemnified party" shall mean the party entitled
to indemnification under Section 10.2 or Section 7.1, and references herein to
the "indemnifying party" shall mean the party obligated to indemnify an
indemnified party against Losses pursuant to Section 10.2 and Section 7.1.

          (b) The right to indemnification, payment of Losses or other remedy
based on such representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations will not
be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to
the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant, or obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the
accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to
indemnification, payment of Losses, or other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations.

     Section 10.2. Indemnification.

          (a) Indemnification by Solectron. Subject to the provisions of this
Article X and Article VII, from and after the Closing, Solectron agrees to
indemnify and hold the Purchaser and its officers, directors and affiliates,
including the Dy 4 Entities after the Closing (the "Purchaser Indemnified
Parties"), harmless against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
deficiencies, costs and expenses (including costs of investigation and defense
and all reasonable legal and other professional fees and disbursements,
interest, penalties and amounts paid in settlement), relating to


                                      -44-




<PAGE>

such claim, loss, liability, damage, deficiency, cost or expense incurred or
suffered (hereinafter individually a "Loss" and collectively "Losses") by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, or any of them, (i) as a result of the breach of
any representation or warranty made by Sellers or the Dy 4 Entities in this
Agreement, (ii) as a result of the breach of any covenant made by Sellers or the
Dy 4 Entities in this Agreement (except in each case as a result of any changes
contemplated or permitted by this Agreement), (iii) as a result of, or
attributable to, the disclosure set forth in Schedule 4.19(a)(iii), or (iv) as a
result of, or attributable to, any unsatisfied obligations to pay severance
benefits or professional fees that were incurred with respect to the
reductions-in-force of employees of the Dy 4 Entities occurring between January
1, 2003 and August 29, 2003. Notwithstanding the foregoing, indemnification for
any Losses relating to Taxes shall be governed by the provisions in Section 7.1;
provided that the provisions of this Article X shall also apply for
indemnification for Losses relating to Taxes to the extent not inconsistent with
the provisions of Article VII.

          (b) Indemnification by Purchaser. Subject to the provisions of this
Article X and Article VII, from and after the Closing, Purchaser agrees to
indemnify and hold each Seller and its officers, directors and affiliates (the
"Seller Indemnified Parties"), harmless against all Losses (other than any
Losses relating to Taxes, for which the indemnification provisions in Section
7.1 shall govern) incurred or suffered by the Seller Indemnified Parties, or any
of them, (i) as a result of the breach of any representation or warranty made by
Purchaser in this Agreement, (ii) as a result of the breach of any covenant made
by Purchaser in this Agreement, or (iii) as a result of, or attributable to, the
failure to provide, as of the Closing Date and through the one-year anniversary
of the Closing Date, Transferred Employees or Transferred Former Employees with
employee benefits and base pay that are equivalent to, or more favorable than,
the benefits and base pay that such Transferred Employees or Transferred Former
Employees received or were entitled to receive under the Employee Plans
immediately prior to Closing.

     Section 10.3. Proceedings Involving Governmental Authorities or Third
Parties. If the existence or amount of any Loss cannot be ascertained until the
conclusion of any audit, examination, litigation, or other proceeding involving
any Governmental Authority, tax authority or third party ("Third Party
Proceeding"), the indemnified party shall give written notice of such Third
Party Proceeding to the indemnifying party within five (5) business days of the
indemnified party's receipt of notice of the commencement of such Third Party
Proceeding. Such written notice shall describe in reasonable detail the facts
constituting the basis for such Third Party Proceeding and the amount of the
potential Loss. Within 20 days after delivery of such notification, the
indemnifying party may, upon written notice thereof to the indemnified party,
assume control of the Third Party Proceeding with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party. If the indemnifying party elects not to
assume control, the indemnified party shall retain control of such Third Party
Proceeding. The party not controlling such Third Party Proceeding (the
"Non-controlling Party") may participate therein at its own expense. The party
controlling such Third Party Proceeding (the "Controlling Party") shall keep the
Non-controlling Party advised of the status of such Third Party Proceeding and
shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party
with respect thereto. The Non-controlling Party shall furnish the Controlling
Party with such information as it may have with respect to such Third Party
Proceeding (including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which
may have been served on such party and any written


                                      -45-




<PAGE>

claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the
same) and shall otherwise cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party such
Third Party Proceeding. The indemnifying party shall not agree to any settlement
of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third Party Proceeding
without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided that the consent of the
indemnified party shall not be required if the indemnifying party agrees in
writing to pay any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement or judgment and
such Third Party Proceeding includes a complete release of the indemnified party
from further liability and has no other adverse effect on the indemnified party.
The indemnified party shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any such Third Party Proceeding without the prior written
consent of the indemnifying party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
of a Loss relating to a Tax Contest, the provisions of Section 7.3 shall govern.

     Section 10.4. Claims for Indemnification. An indemnified party shall make
any claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.2 (subject to Section 7.3
with respect to claims made under both Section 10.2 and Section 7.1) by
delivering an Officer's Certificate to the indemnifying party. For purposes
hereof, "Officer's Certificate" shall mean a certificate signed by any officer
of the Purchaser, in the case of a Purchaser Indemnified Party, and Solectron,
in the case of a Seller Indemnified Party; and such certificate shall (A) state
that the party claiming indemnification has paid, incurred or properly accrued
or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay, incur or accrue Losses, and
(B) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Losses included in
the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid, incurred or properly
accrued, or the basis for such anticipated liability.

     Section 10.5. Objections to Claims for Indemnification. An indemnifying
party may make a written objection ("Objection") to any claim for
indemnification. Subject to Section 7.3 with respect to claims made under both
Section 10.2 and Section 7.1, the Objection shall be delivered to the
indemnified party within 30 days after delivery of the Officer's Certificate to
the indemnifying party.

     Section 10.6. Resolution by the Parties. The indemnifying party and the
indemnified party shall attempt in good faith to resolve any claim for
indemnification to which an Objection is made. If such parties are able to
resolve any such claim for indemnification, they shall prepare and sign a
memorandum setting forth such agreement. The indemnifying party shall pay to the
applicable indemnified party by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated by such indemnified party the agreed-upon amount of the
Loss (if any) within 15 days of the date of the written memorandum described in
the preceding sentence.

     Section 10.7. Arbitration. Subject to Section 7.3 with respect to claims
made under both Section 10.2 and Section 7.1, if the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party are unable to resolve a claim for indemnification to which an
Objection has been made within 20 days (as such period may be extended by mutual
agreement between Solectron and Purchaser), either the indemnifying party or the
indemnified party shall serve the other with a written demand for arbitration
within 30 days of the expiration of such 20-day period, unless the amount of the
Loss is at


                                      -46-




<PAGE>

issue in a Third Party Proceeding, in which event arbitration shall not be
commenced until such amount is ascertained or Solectron and Purchaser agree to
commence arbitration. Any such arbitration shall be held in Santa Clara County,
California and shall be conducted before a single arbitrator mutually agreeable
to Solectron and Purchaser in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules
of the American Arbitration Association. In the event that within 30 days after
submission of any dispute to arbitration Solectron and Purchaser cannot mutually
agree on one arbitrator, Solectron and Purchaser shall each select one
arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator.
The decision of the arbitrator or, if applicable, the majority of the three
arbitrators regarding any claim for indemnification to which an Objection has
been made shall be binding and conclusive. Such decision shall be written and
shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set
forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator. The
parties agree to complete such arbitration as expeditiously as reasonably
possible.

     Section 10.8. Treatment of Indemnification Claims. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by all parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price.

     Section 10.9. Threshold for Indemnification Claims. The Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to make a claim for indemnification
under Section 10.2(a)(i) (other than for any claims for indemnification (a)
alleging a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections
4.20 or 4.24, (b) for Losses relating to Taxes, or (c) pursuant to Section
10.2(a)(iii), in each case, which shall not be subject to any such limitation)
until the Losses claimed exceed $400,000 in the aggregate (the "Basket Amount"),
in which case the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover all
Losses in excess of the Basket Amount. No indemnified party shall be permitted
to assert any individual claim for indemnification involving alleged Losses of
less than $25,000 (other than for any claims for indemnification (a) alleging a
breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.20 or 4.24,
(b) for Losses relating to Taxes, or (c) pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(iii), in
each case, which shall not be subject to any such limitation) unless such claims
originate from the same set of factual circumstances and, in the aggregate,
exceed the Basket Amount.

     Section 10.10. Limitation on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, Solectron's liability for indemnifying the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to Article X (other than for any claims
for indemnification (i) alleging a breach of the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 4.20, (ii) alleging a breach of the covenants set forth in
Sections 6.14 and 6.16, or (iii) pursuant to Article VII, which shall not be
subject to any such limitation) shall not exceed $15,000,000 in the aggregate
(the "Indemnity Cap"). Neither Solectron nor Purchaser shall have a right for
indemnification with respect to any incidental, special, punitive or
consequential damages incurred or suffered by an indemnified party hereunder.

     Section 10.11. Exclusive Remedy. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that, from and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties
hereto with respect to any and all monetary claims arising in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be pursuant to the
indemnification obligations set forth in Section 10.2 and Section 7.1. In
addition,


                                      -47-




<PAGE>

Sellers shall not have any liability under this Agreement except to the extent
of the Indemnity Cap. The foregoing shall not prohibit a party from bringing a
claim for fraud.

     Section 10.12. No Set-Off. Neither the Purchaser nor any Purchaser
Indemnified Party shall have any right to set-off any Losses against any
payments to be made by the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement or the
Transition Services Agreement.

or public announcement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement without
the prior written approval of the other parties; provided, however, that any
party may make any public disclosure it believes in good faith is required by
applicable Law, regulation or stock market rule (in which case the disclosing
party shall use reasonable efforts to advise the other parties and provide them

treatment and Tax structure, except to the extent necessary to comply with any
applicable federal, state or provincial securities laws, provided that the
parties acknowledge and agree that the Tax treatment and Tax structure of any
Transaction does not include the name of any party to the Transaction or any
sensitive business information (including, without limitation, the name and
other specific information about any party's intellectual property or other
proprietary assets) unless such information is necessary to understand the
purported or claimed federal income Tax treatment of the Transaction.

     Section 11.4. Severability. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or
public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal

materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or


                                      -49-

incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to

     Section 11.7. No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted
assigns and nothing herein, whether express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of

the benefit of the individuals referred to in such Section.

     Section 11.8. Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified except (i) by an instrument in writing signed

CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY.

     Section 11.11. Counterparts and Facsimile Signature. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile signature.

     Section 11.12. Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement was not
performed in accordance with the terms thereof and that, prior to the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms, the parties shall be
entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other
remedy at law or equity.

     Section 11.13. Guarantee. Curtiss-Wright Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Guarantor") irrevocably guarantees each and every representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement and obligation of the Purchaser and the full and
timely performance of its obligations under the provisions of this Agreement.
This is a guarantee of payment and performance, and not of collection, and
Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that this guarantee is full and unconditional,
and no release or extinguishments of the Purchaser's obligations or liabilities
(other than in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), whether by decree
in any bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, shall affect the continuing validity
and enforceability of this guarantee. Purchaser hereby waives, for the benefit
of the Dy 4 Entities and the Sellers, (i) any right to require the Dy 4 Entities
or the Sellers as a condition of payment or performance of Guarantor to proceed
against the Purchaser or pursue any other remedies whatsoever and (ii) to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any defenses or benefits that may be derived
from or afforded by law that limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or
sureties, except to the extent that any such defense is available to the
Purchaser. Guarantor understands that the Dy 4 Entities and the Sellers are
relying on this guarantee in entering into this Agreement. Guarantor has all
necessary power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry out its
obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
performance of this Section 11.13, by Guarantor does not and will not (i)
violate, conflict with or result in the breach of any provision of the charter
or bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of such Person, (ii) conflict
with or violate in any material respect any Law or Governmental Order applicable
to such Person, or (iii) conflict in any material respect with, or result in any
material breach of, constitute a material default (or event which with the
giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would become a material default)
under, require any consent under, or give to others any rights of termination,
amendment, acceleration, suspension, revocation or cancellation of, any material
note, bond, mortgage, deed of trust, indenture, contract, agreement, lease,
sublease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or arrangement to which
Guarantor is a party or by which any of such assets or properties is bound or
affected, in each case which could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the ability of Guarantor to perform its obligations under this
Section 11.13.
