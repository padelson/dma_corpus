Business Days of final determination of the Net Adjustment Amount pursuant to

Multiple; multiplied by (iii) the Enterprise Value Percentage. If the Adjusted
EBITDA for a particular Calculation Period is not positive, no Participation
Payment shall be due for such Calculation Period. A sample calculation of
Participation Payments is set forth on Appendix C. If Stuempfig is entitled
under the Stuempfig Bonus Agreement to any payment of any portion of the Earn-
Out Bonus (as defined in the Stuempfig Bonus Agreement) after Closing as a
result of the actual payment of any Participation Payment, then such amount of
such portion of the Earn-Out Bonus shall reduce the portion of such
Participation Payment that is paid to the Shareholders under this Section 2.5
and shall instead be paid to Stuempfig by the Company as provided in the
Stuempfig Bonus Agreement.

(b) Procedures Applicable to Determination of the Participation Payments. For
each Calculation Period, on or before the date which is the earlier of (x) the
first March 31 after such Calculation Period, and (y) fifteen (15) days after
the completion of the audit of Buyer's financial statements for such
Calculation Period, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Shareholder
Representative a written statement (in each case, a "Participation Payment
Calculation Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail its determination
of Adjusted EBITDA for such Calculation Period and its calculation of the
resulting Participation Payment (in each case, a "Participation Payment
Calculation").

(c) Independence of Participation Payments. Buyer\'s obligation to pay each of
the Participation Payments to the Shareholders in accordance with Section
2.5(a) is an independent obligation of Buyer and is not otherwise conditioned
or contingent upon the satisfaction of any conditions precedent to any
preceding or subsequent Participation Payment, and the obligation to pay a
Participation Payment to the Shareholders shall not obligate Buyer to pay any
preceding or subsequent Participation Payment. For the avoidance of doubt and
by way of example, if the conditions precedent to the payment of the
Participation Payment for the first Calculation Period are not satisfied, but
the conditions precedent to the payment of the Participation Payment for the
second Calculation Period are satisfied, then Buyer would be obligated to pay
such Participation Payment for the second Calculation Period for which the
corresponding conditions precedent have been satisfied, and not the
Participation Payment for the first Calculation Period.

(d) Timing of Payment of Participation Payments. Subject to Section 2.5(f),
any Participation Payment that Buyer is required to pay pursuant to Section
2.5(a) hereof shall be paid in full no later than three Business Days
following the date upon which the determination of Adjusted EBITDA for the
applicable Calculation Period becomes final and binding upon the parties as
provided in Section 2.6 (including any final resolution of any dispute raised
by Shareholder Representative in a Notice of Disagreement). Buyer shall pay to
the Shareholders their Pro Rata Share of the applicable Participation Payment
in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank accounts
designated by Shareholder Representative.

(e) Post-closing Operation of the Company. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement, subsequent to the Closing, Buyer shall have sole discretion with
regard to all matters relating to the operation of the Company; provided,
however, that Buyer shall not, directly or indirectly, take any actions in bad
faith that would have the purpose of avoiding or reducing any of the
Participation Payments hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from the
Closing until the end of the



 Participation Payment Period, unless otherwise determined by unanimous written
approval of the members of the Company Board, Buyer agrees as follows:

(i) Company shall remain as a separate corporate entity and the entity and all
of its material operating assets shall remain controlled by Buyer;

(ii) Company shall maintain complete and accurate books and records adequate
in all material respects to permit an audit as a stand-alone entity;

(iii) Company or any Company subsidiary shall not discontinue, wind up, reduce
the scope of, sell, liquidate or otherwise dispose of all or any material part
of its assets, other than in the ordinary course of business;

(iv) Company and its employees shall not be relocated from its current
locations except for relocation to the extent that the Company consolidates
its distribution capabilities as intended by the Company as of the Closing;

(v) The business, assets or operations of no other person or entity (including
any division of Buyer) shall be combined with Company or any Company
subsidiary's business, whether by merger, acquisition or otherwise;

(vi) Company and any Company subsidiary will be operated consistent with
Company's past practices (except as related to continued growth which may
change how the Company operates) and unless Duong is no longer employed by the
Company, Duong will be Chief Executive Officer of the Company with such
authority as customarily afforded such position;

(vii) Without limiting Subsection (vi) immediately above, while employed by
the Company, any CFO or finance/accounting-related employees of the Company or
any Company subsidiary shall be only those reasonably acceptable to Duong;

(viii) Company or any Company subsidiary shall not effect any transaction with
Buyer or its Affiliates on a basis less favorable in any material respect to
Company than would be the case if such transaction had been at arms'-length
with an unrelated third party;

(ix) Buyer and its Affiliates shall not sell Restricted Footwear Products on
any third-party online marketplace or e-commerce website used by the Company
to sell footwear products during the 12 months ended December 31, 2015;
provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to the sale
of any footwear products (including Restricted Footwear Products) on behalf of
the Company or by any subsidiary of Buyer acquired after the Effective Date
and in the business of selling footwear products. "Restricted Footwear
Products" means any footwear products sourced from the Company's five largest
vendors measured by dollar volume during the twelve months ended December 31,
2015;

(x) Company shall not modify the employment agreement of Duong;

(xi) Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates will take any action the primary
purpose of which is to decrease the maximum amount of the Participation
Payments;



 (xii) The financial statements used for the determination of Adjusted EBITDA
shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP;

(xiii) None of the Company, Shareholders, Buyer nor any of its affiliates will
cause Company to take any action outside of the ordinary course of business
that would have the effect of shifting revenues or expenses into or out of any
period from periods in which such revenues or expenses would otherwise be
recognized consistent with GAAP;

(xiv) The Company shall have a board of directors comprised of three directors
(the "Company Board"), one of which shall be appointed by the Shareholders,
provided, however, that the Shareholders shall not appoint Duong to the
Company Board if his employment with the Company has been terminated due to
his death, disability or for cause (as defined in his employment agreement).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer has no obligation to operate the Company
in order to achieve any Participation Payment or to maximize the amount of any
Participation Payment. The Shareholders acknowledge that (i) there is no
assurance that the Shareholders will receive any Participation Payment and
Buyer has not promised or projected any Participation Payment, and (ii) the
parties solely intend the express provisions of this Agreement to govern their
contractual relationship with respect thereto.

(f) Right of Set-off. Buyer shall have the right to withhold and set off
against any amount otherwise due to be paid pursuant to this Section 2.5 the
amount of (i) any Net Adjustment Amount owed to it as finally determined
pursuant to Section 2 and (ii) any Losses to which any Buyer Indemnified
Person is entitled as finally determined under Article 8 of this Agreement;
provided, however, if there is a dispute with respect to the Net Adjustment
Amount or any Losses to which any Buyer Indemnified Person may be entitled
under Article 8 of this Agreement, Buyer shall promptly place the amount in
dispute into a neutral third party escrow (under an escrow agreement agreed to
in good faith by Buyer, the Shareholder Representative, and such third party
escrow) for the benefit of the Shareholders until resolution of such dispute.

(g) No Security. The parties hereto understand and agree that (i) the
contingent rights to receive any Participation Payment shall not be
represented by any form of certificate or other instrument, are not
transferable, except by operation of Laws relating to descent and
distribution, divorce and community property, and do not constitute an equity
or ownership interest in Buyer or the Company, (ii) the Shareholders shall not
have any rights as a securityholder of Buyer or the Company as a result of the
Shareholder's contingent right to receive any Participation Payment hereunder,
and (iii) no interest is payable with respect to any Participation Payment.

Section 2.6. Net Adjustment Amount and Participation Payment Determinations.

(a) During the sixty (60) day period following Buyer\'s delivery of the
Closing Statement or the Participation Payment Calculation Statement to the
Shareholder Representative (the "Review Period"), Buyer shall provide the
Shareholder Representative and its Representatives reasonable access to the
relevant books and records and employees of the Company for the purpose of
facilitating the Shareholder Representative\'s review of the Closing Statement
or the Participation Payment Calculation Statement as applicable. The Closing
Statement and the Participation Payment Calculation Statement as applicable
shall become final and binding at the end of the last day of the



 Review Period, unless prior to the end of the Review Period, the Shareholder
Representative delivers to Buyer a written notice of disagreement (a "Notice
of Disagreement") specifying the nature and amount of any and all items in
dispute as to the amounts set forth in the Closing Statement or the
Participation Payment Calculation Statement as applicable. The Shareholder
Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts in
the Closing Statement or the Participation Payment Calculation Statement as
applicable not specifically referenced in a Notice of Disagreement provided
prior to the end of the Review Period.

(b) During the thirty (30) day period following delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement by the Shareholder Representative to Buyer (the "Resolution
Period"), such parties in good faith shall seek to resolve in writing any
differences that they may have with respect to the computation of the amounts
as specified therein. Any disputed items resolved in writing between the
Shareholder Representative and Buyer within the Resolution Period shall be
final and binding on the parties for all purposes hereunder. If the
Shareholder Representative and Buyer have not resolved all such differences by
the end of the Resolution Period, the Shareholder Representative and Buyer
shall submit, in writing, such differences to the Accounting Expert. The
"Accounting Expert" shall be Ernst and Young, or, in the event that it is not
available or is not a Neutral Accounting Firm, a Neutral Accounting Firm
selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and the Shareholder Representative;
provided, however, that: (i) if, within fifteen (15) days after the end of the
Resolution Period, such parties are unable to agree on a Neutral Accounting
Firm to act as the Accounting Expert, then each party shall select a Neutral
Accounting Firm and such firms together shall select the Neutral Accounting
Firm to act as the Accounting Expert, and (ii) if any party does not select a
Neutral Accounting Firm within ten (10) days of written demand therefor by the
other party, then the Neutral Accounting Firm selected by the other party
shall act as the Accounting Expert. A "Neutral Accounting Firm" means Ernst and
Young, Deloitte, KPMG, or PricewaterhouseCoopers; provided, however that no
individual accountant assigned to work on any dispute shall have ever worked
on any matter for any party hereto or any Affiliate, and provided further that
a Neutral Accounting Firm shall not include any accounting firm that, at the
time it is acting as, or engaged to act as, the Accounting Expert hereunder,
is performing, or has been engaged to perform, an audit of the financial
statements of any party hereto, or any Affiliate, or has done so within the
past two (2) years.

(c) The parties shall arrange for the Accounting Expert to agree in its
engagement letter to act in accordance with this Section. Each party shall
present a brief to the Accounting Expert (which brief shall also be
concurrently provided to the other party) within twenty (20) days of the
appointment of the Accounting Expert detailing such party\'s views as to the
correct nature and amount of each item remaining in dispute from the Notice of
Disagreement (and for the avoidance of doubt, no party may introduce a dispute
to the Accounting Expert that was not originally set forth on the Notice of
Disagreement). Within ten (10) days of receipt of the brief, the receiving
party may present a responsive brief to the Accounting Expert (which
responsive brief shall also be concurrently provided to the other party). Each
party may make an oral presentation to the Accounting Expert (in which case,
such presenting party shall notify the other party of such presentation, and
the other party shall have the right to be present (and speak) at such
presentation), within thirty (30) days of the appointment of the Accounting
Expert. The Accounting Expert shall have the opportunity to present written
questions to either party, a copy of which shall be provided to the other
party. The Accounting Expert shall consider only those items and amounts in
the Shareholder Representative\'s and Buyer\'s respective calculations that
are identified as being items and amounts to which the Shareholder
Representative



 and Buyer have been unable to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the
Accounting Expert shall select either the position of Buyer or Shareholder
Representative as a resolution for each item or amount disputed and may not
impose an alternative resolution with respect to any item or amount disputed.
The Accounting Expert shall make a written determination, which determination
shall be made solely in accordance with this Article 2 (and, for the avoidance
of doubt, subject to Section 2.6(d) hereof), within sixty (60) days of its
appointment as to each such disputed item, which determination shall, subject
to Section 2.6(d) hereof, be final and binding on the parties for all purposes
hereunder absent manifest error. The fees and expenses of the Accounting
Expert and of any enforcement of the determination thereof, shall be borne by
the Shareholders (in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares), on the
one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, in inverse proportion as they may
prevail on the matters resolved by the Accounting Expert, which proportionate
allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative
dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the
Accounting Expert at the time the determination of such firm is rendered on
the merits of the matters submitted.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement (including this Section 2.6) to
the contrary, the Accounting Expert shall have no authority to resolve any
dispute regarding, or make any determination as to whether, Buyer has breached
any covenants in Section 2.5(e) (the "Participation Payment Covenants"), and
it shall make its determination under this Section 2.6 without regard to any
such dispute. Any dispute between any Shareholder and/or Shareholder
Representative on the one hand, and Buyer on the other, as to whether Buyer
has breached any Participation Payment Covenants shall be resolved in
arbitration solely as provided in Section 10.8 hereof, and in no event,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, shall the Losses that the
Shareholders may recover as a result of any breach of any Participation
Payment Covenants be limited or restricted in any way by the Accounting
Expert's determination or resolution under this Section 2.6.

Section 2.7. Adjustments and Withholding.

(a) Any adjustments made pursuant to this Article 2 shall be deemed
adjustments to the Purchase Price.

(b) The Shareholders shall not have any liability with respect to any amounts
included in the calculation of the Closing Company Transaction Expenses,
Closing Funded Indebtedness, or the Closing Working Capital, except as
determined and paid in accordance with this Article 2.

(c) Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment or the deemed purchase of assets under any provision of federal,
state, local or foreign Tax law. If Buyer or the Company, as the case may be,
so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Shareholders.

provide compensation and/or benefits following the Closing. For purposes of
this Agreement, "ERISA Affiliate" means, with respect to any person, trade or
business, or other entity, any other person, trade or business, or entity that
is or was treated as a single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o)
of the Code or Section 4001(a)(14) or (b)(1) of ERISA.

(b) Disclosure of Benefit Plan Materials. True and complete copies of the
following materials have been previously furnished to Buyer with respect to
each Benefit Plan to the extent applicable: (i) all current and prior plan
documents, (ii) all current and prior plan amendments, (iii) all current trust
agreements, (iv) all current trust amendments, (v) all current summary plan
descriptions and any summary of material modifications (including any formal
or informal summaries and written interpretations of such Benefit Plan), (vi)
annual reports filed on Form 5500 for the previous six plan years, (vii) all
current insurance policies, (viii) all current administrative contracts,
including without limitation service provider agreements, investment
management and investment advisory agreements, (ix) all current and prior
favorable determination letters from the IRS, (x) all current sample
administrative forms, (xi) nondiscrimination tests for the previous six years,
(xii) all current investment contracts, and (xiii) actuarial or other
financial reports for the previous six years.



 (c) Compliance. Each Benefit Plan has been administered and maintained, from
the time of such Benefit Plan's inception up to and including the Closing
Date, in substantial compliance with (i) the terms of such Benefit Plan, (ii)
any statutes, orders, rules or regulations, including but not limited to ERISA
and the Code and any and all collective bargaining agreements and other
agreements, and (iii) any fiduciary standards prescribed under ERISA.

(d) Tax-Qualified Status. Each Benefit Plan which is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code is currently so qualified and has been so
qualified and has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS with
respect to the qualification and tax-exempt status of the Benefit Plan or is
established on a preapproved plan document for which the Company can rely upon
the IRS preapproval with respect to the Company's plan, and each trust forming
a part thereof is exempt from tax pursuant to Section 501(a) of the Code.
Nothing has occurred (or failed to occur) in any material respect to cause the
loss of the Benefit Plan's qualification and tax-exempt status during the
period from the time of such Benefit Plan\'s inception up to and including the
Closing Date. Each Benefit Plan which is a "cafeteria" or other similar plan
that is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 125 of the Code does
satisfy such requirements from the time of such Benefit Plan\'s inception up
to and including the Closing Date.

(e) Funding and Contribution Issues. No Benefit Plan constitutes (i) a
"multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, (ii)
a "defined benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(35), (iii) any other plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA, or (iv) a plan maintained in connection with any
trust described in Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. No condition exists and no
event has occurred that could constitute grounds for termination of any
Benefit Plan, and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate of the Company
has incurred, or reasonably expects to incur, any material liability under
Title IV of ERISA arising in connection with the termination of, or complete
or partial withdrawal from, any plan covered or previously covered by Title IV
of ERISA. No "accumulated funding deficiency," as defined in Section 412 of
the Code, has been incurred with respect to any Benefit Plan, whether or not
waived. Full payment has been made of all amounts which the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate of the Company is required to have paid as contributions to or
benefits under any Benefit Plan as of the end of the most recent plan year
thereof and there are no unfunded obligations under any Benefit Plan that have
not been disclosed to Buyer in writing prior to the Closing. All contributions
and contribution obligations have been reflected on the most recent financial
statements of the Company.

(f) Reporting and Disclosure. The Company has complied with all reporting and
disclosure obligations to all governmental entities and all participants and
beneficiaries with respect to each Benefit Plan required by the terms of such
Benefit Plan and any statutes, orders, rules or regulations, including but not
limited to ERISA, the Code and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

(g) Other Liabilities and Reportable Events. Nothing done or omitted to be
done and no transaction or holding of any asset under or in connection with
any Benefit Plan has or will make the Company or any party to this agreement
subject to any liability under Title I of ERISA or liable for any tax or
penalty, including without limitation any excise tax imposed under Chapter 43
of Schedule D of the Code pursuant to Section 4975 of the Code. There is no
pending or threatened litigation, arbitration, disputed claim, adjudication,
audit, investigation, examination or other proceeding with respect to any
Benefit Plan or any fiduciary or administrator thereof in their capacities



 as such, and the Company has no knowledge of any facts which would give rise
to or could give rise to any such litigation, arbitration, disputed claim,
adjudication, audit, investigation, examination or other proceeding. No
"reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA, and no event
described in Section 4041, 4042, 4062 or 4063 of ERISA has occurred in
connection with any Benefit Plan.

(h) Nondeductible Benefits. No benefit under any Benefit Plan has in the past
or could give rise in the future to the payment of any amount that would not
be deductible pursuant to the current provisions of the Code, including
without limitation excess parachute payments under Section 280G of the Code.

(i) No Retiree Medical Benefits. Except as required by Section 4908B of the
Code and Title I, Part 6 of ERISA or applicable state law, there is no
liability in respect of or any obligation to provide post-retirement health
and medical benefits for retired or former employees of the Company or any of
its ERISA Affiliates, and the Company has reserved its right to amend or
terminate any Benefit Plan providing health or medical benefits under the
terms of any such plan and descriptions thereof given to employees.

(j) COBRA Compliance. With respect to Benefit Plans which are "group health
plans" under Section 4980B of the Code or Section 607(1) of ERISA, there has
been timely compliance in all material respects with all requirements imposed
under Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Title I of ERISA, so that
neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates of the Company have any
and will not incur any loss, assessment, tax penalty, or other sanction with
respect to any such Benefit Plan.

(k) HIPAA Compliance. With respect to Benefit Plans which are "group health
plans" under Section 9832 of the Code or Section 733 of ERISA, such Benefit
Plans have been maintained in compliance in all material respects with all
requirements imposed under Subtitle K of the Code and Part 7 of Title I of
ERISA, so that neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has any and
will not incur any loss, assessment, tax penalty, or other sanction with
respect to any such Benefit Plan. If the Company or any of its Benefit Plans
are treated as a "covered entity" under the Privacy and Security Standards at
45 CFR Parts 160 through 164, such covered entities have complied in all
material respects with such standards beginning with the effective date of
such standards to such covered entities.

(l) No Increased Benefits or Vesting. There has been no amendment, written
interpretation, announcement (whether or not written) or any other change by
the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates, which would (i) increase the
expense of maintaining any Benefit Plan above the level of the expense of such
Benefit Plan when compared to the fiscal year or plan year ended immediately
prior to the Closing, or (ii) express any intention or make any commitment to
create any additional plan that would constitute an Benefit Plan that is not
yet effective. The execution and consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not constitute any type of a triggering event under any
Benefit Plan, whether or not legally enforceable, which (either alone or upon
the occurrence of any additional or subsequent event) will or may result in
(i) any payment of severance pay of any type, (ii) any acceleration or other
impact on vested benefits, or (iii) any increase in benefits, to any current
or former participant, employee or director of the Company. The Company



 is not a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that has
resulted or could result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of
(i) any "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign tax law) and
(ii) any amount that will not be fully deductible as a result of Section
162(m) (or any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign tax law).

(m) No Employment or Severance Arrangements. The Company is not a party or
subject to any union contract or any employment contract or arrangement
providing for annual future compensation to any employee, owner, shareholder
or independent contractor of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates,
including (without limitation) any severance or other similar contract,
arrangement or policy, whether written or oral, providing for compensation or
benefits upon termination.

(n) Nonqualified Plan Issues. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has,
since October 3, 2004, (i) granted to any Person an interest in a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan (as defined in Code Section 409A(d)(1)), which
interest has been or, upon lapse of a substantial risk of forfeiture with
respect to such interest, will be subject to the tax imposed by Code Section
409A(a)(1)(B) or (b)(4)(A), or (ii) modified the terms of any nonqualified
deferred compensation plan in a manner that would cause an interest previously
granted under such plan to become subject to the taxes imposed by Code Section
409A. No Person had a legally binding right to an amount under a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate prior to
January 1, 2005 that is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture or a
requirement to perform future services after December 31, 2004, which would
subject such Person to the taxes imposed by Code Section 409A.

forth in Article 3 and Article 4 constitute the sole and exclusive
representation, warranties, and statements (including by omission) of any kind
of the Shareholders and the Company or any of their respective Representatives
or Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and
neither the Shareholders nor the Company, or any of their respective
Representatives or Affiliates, has made, and do not make and each specifically
negates and disclaims any representations, warranties, promises, covenants,
agreements, guaranties or statements (including by omission) of any kind or
character whatsoever, whether express or implied, oral or written, past,
present, or future, of, as to, concerning, with respect



 to, or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (except as (and
solely to the extent) specifically set forth in this Agreement).

(b) In connection with Buyer's investigation of the Company, Buyer and its
Representatives have received from the Company (or through their
Representatives or the Company) certain projections, estimates and other
forecasts and certain business plan information (including a Confidential

it is familiar with such uncertainties, that it is making its own evaluation
of the adequacy and accuracy of all Projections so furnished or made available
to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
Projections), that no representations, warranties or statements (including by
omission) of any kind are being made with respect to such Projections, and any
use of, or reliance by, it on such Projections shall be at its sole risk, and

subject to any liability or obligation (indemnification or otherwise) to Buyer
or any other Person resulting from (nor shall Buyer or any other Person have
any claim with respect to) the distribution to Buyer or its Representatives or
Affiliates, or Buyer's or any of its Representative's or Affiliate's use of,
or reliance on, any such Projections, written or oral information, or any
information, documents or other material made available to Buyer or its
Representatives and Affiliates in any form in expectation of, or in connection
with, the transactions contemplated hereby, or otherwise, regardless of the
legal theory under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be

Contract (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, ordinary course fees and
expenses of their respective attorneys and advisors), commence or participate
in any Action or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to
any third party.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.2 shall require,
or be construed to require, Buyer or its Affiliates to agree to: (i) sell,
hold, divest, discontinue or limit, before or after the Closing Date, any
assets, businesses or interests of Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates; (ii) any conditions relating to, or changes or
restrictions in, the operations of any such assets, businesses or interests
which, in either case, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material

benefits to Buyer of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement; or (iii)
any material modification or waiver of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

(h) Buyer agrees to provide such security and assurances as to financial

Law or any Governmental Authority, (ii) as otherwise contemplated hereby,
(iii) as Buyer may consent, which consent may not unreasonably be withheld,

lenders, suppliers, regulators and others having business relationships with
the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a Material
Adverse Effect occurs as a result of actions or omissions that the Company
would have been expected to take (or omit taking) in light of the competitive
position and financial resources of the Company, the Company, in its
reasonable discretion, may respond to such Material Adverse Effect by taking
actions to remedy the Material Adverse Effect (and shall also promptly provide
Buyer with notice of such actions, which notice shall describe such actions
with reasonable particularity).

(b) The Company shall not:

(i) implement or adopt any material change in its Accounting Principles,
practices or methods, other than as may be required by Law or applicable
accounting requirements;

terms of this Agreement, the Company shall be freely permitted to declare, pay
or issue cash dividends or distributions, including, without limitation,
distribution of the items set forth on Schedule 6.3;

Buyer in writing of (i) any fact, circumstance, event or action the existence,
occurrence or taking of which, to the Company's Knowledge, (A) has had, or
could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect, or (B) has resulted in, or could reasonably be

warranty or agreement given or made by Seller in this Agreement.

(c) Solely on the Closing Date, except as otherwise expressly contemplated
hereby, Buyer shall not cause the Company to take any action outside the
ordinary course of business consistent with the past practice of the Company
that would materially impact Closing Cash on Hand, Closing Company Transaction
Expenses, Closing Funded Indebtedness, or Closing Working Capital.

Section 6.4. Public Disclosure; Confidentiality.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
except as may be required to comply with the requirements of any applicable
Law or stock exchange requirement applicable to Buyer, from and after the date

which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(b) From and after the date of this Agreement, each of Buyer, the Company and
the Shareholders shall, and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates
to, keep confidential the terms and existence of this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents and the negotiations relating thereto and all documents
and information obtained by a party from another party in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the "Confidential
Information") except: (i) to the extent that it is reasonably necessary to
disclose the Confidential Information to obtain the Regulatory Approvals or
Third Party Consents, (ii) for disclosures otherwise made in satisfaction of
any of the obligations under this Agreement, (iii) to the extent required by
applicable Law or stock exchange requirement applicable to Buyer, (iv) as made
public prior to the date of this Agreement by either party not in violation of

their respective Representatives but subject to the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby incorporated herein
by reference and shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at
which time the Confidentiality



 Agreement shall terminate. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the
Closing, then the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms.

Section 6.5. Exclusive Dealing. During the period from the date hereof through
the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement, neither the Company
nor the Shareholders shall take any action to encourage, initiate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Buyer and its
Affiliates and Representatives) concerning any sale of the equity interests
of, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of (including by merger
or consolidation), the Company (other than assets sold in the ordinary course
of business), in accordance with the provisions of that certain exclusivity
letter executed by DSW Inc., the Company and the Shareholders dated January
21, 2016, notwithstanding any expiration date or other provision contained
therein.

Section 6.6. Non-Competition. Each Shareholder agrees as follows:

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth
(5th) anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Non-Competition Period"), such
Shareholder shall not (except on behalf of the Company) engage in or assist
others in engaging in, own, control, or participate in the ownership,
management, or control of, lend money or capital to, or invest capital in, any
business or Person that engages in, the business of selling overstocks and
closeouts of brand name shoes and/or Related Retail Goods from manufacturers,
retailers and wholesalers through e-commerce channels (the "Business"),
anywhere in the world where the Company conducts or contemplates conducting
the Business at Closing or during the Non-Competition Period; provided,
however, that such Shareholder shall not be prohibited from owning up to five
percent (5%) of the outstanding stock of a corporation that is publicly traded
on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market so long as
such Shareholder has no active participation in connection with the business
of such corporation. "Related Retail Goods" means footwear, footwear products,
footwear accessories, handbags, soft leather goods, hosiery, slippers,
jewelry, outerwear, watches, eyewear, neckwear, ties, scarves, and belts.

(b) During the Non-Competition Period, such Shareholder shall not induce or
attempt to induce any employee of the Company to leave the employ of the
Company.

(c) Each Shareholder acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of this
Section 6.6 would give rise to irreparable harm to Buyer, for which monetary
damages would not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in the event
of a breach or a threatened breach by any Shareholder of any such obligations,
Buyer shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may be
available to it in respect of such breach, be entitled to equitable relief,
including a temporary restraining order, an injunction, specific performance
and any other relief that may be available from a court of competent
jurisdiction (without any requirement to post bond).

(d) Each Shareholder acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this
Section 6.6 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests
of Buyer and constitute a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
the event that any covenant contained in this Section 6.6 should ever be
adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or service, or other
limitations permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is
expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant



 shall be deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time,
geographic, product or service, or other limitations permitted by applicable
Law (but in no event greater than as provided in the covenant itself). The
covenants contained in this Section 6.6 and each provision hereof are
severable and distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as written shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants or provisions
hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other
jurisdiction.

Section 6.7. Release. Buyer agrees that, effective as of the Closing Date, the
Company shall be deemed to have released and discharged each Shareholder
(whether in such Person's capacity as a shareholder, director, officer,
employee or otherwise) from any and all claims, demands and causes of action,
whether known or unknown, liquidated or contingent, relating to, arising out
of or in any way connected with the dealings of the Company and such Person
from the beginning of time through the Closing Date (other than claims arising
from fraud, criminal activity, or willful misconduct), it being understood,
however, that such release shall not operate to release such Person from any
indemnity obligations, if any, under Article 8. Each Shareholder agrees that,
effective as of the Closing Date, such Shareholder shall be deemed to have
released and discharged the Company and its Representatives from any and all
claims, demands and causes of action, whether known or unknown, liquidated or
contingent, relating to, arising out of or in any way connected with the
dealings of the Company and such Shareholder from the beginning of time
through the Closing Date (other than claims arising from fraud, criminal
activity, or willful misconduct and other than any claims or rights the
Shareholders may have under this Agreement or any Transaction Document
(including but not limited to Duong's employment and related agreements with
the Company)). Buyer and the Shareholders acknowledge that the Laws of many
states provide substantially the following: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND
TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER
FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST
HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR." Buyer and the
Shareholders acknowledge that such provisions are designed to protect a party
from waiving claims which it does not know exist or may exist. Nonetheless,
Buyer and the Shareholders agree that, effective as of the Closing Date, the
Company and Buyer and the Shareholders shall be deemed to waive any such
provision. Buyer and the Shareholders further agree that none of Buyer, the
Company, or any Shareholder shall, nor permit any Affiliate thereof to: (a)
institute a lawsuit or other legal proceeding based upon, arising out of, or
relating to any of the released claims, (b) participate, assist, or cooperate
in any such proceeding or (c) encourage, assist and/or solicit any third party
to institute any such proceeding. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.7
or otherwise, nothing in this Section 6.7 shall limit in any way any
Shareholder's right under California Workers' Compensation laws to file or
pursue any workers' compensation claim. Nothing in this Section 6.7 shall
release any Shareholder's rights to: (i) any claims that cannot be waived as a
matter of law including claims for workers' compensation insurance or
unemployment insurance benefits, (ii) any claims that any Shareholder may have
to continued participation in the Company's health plans pursuant to the terms
and conditions of COBRA or any comparable law, (iii) any right or claim that
any Shareholder may have to vested entitlements pursuant to any ERISA governed
benefit plan maintained by or on behalf of the Company, or (iv) any claims
that any Shareholder has to indemnification from the Company in accordance
with Section 6.9.



 Section 6.8. Access to Records and Employees after Closing.

(a) For a period of seven years after the Closing Date, each Shareholder and
its Representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and
records of the Company, to the extent that such access may reasonably be
required in connection with matters relating to or affected by the operations
of the Company prior to the Closing Date, including the preparation of the
Shareholder's financial reports or Tax Returns, any Tax audits, the defense or
prosecution of Actions, and any other reasonable need of the Shareholder to
consult such books and records. Such access shall be afforded by Buyer upon
receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours. If any
such books or records, or any other documents which the Shareholders have the
right to have access to pursuant to this Section 6.8(a) are produced by Buyer
or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, to an actual or
potentially adverse party (e.g., in litigation or in connection with a
government investigation), Buyer shall endeavor to immediately make all such
books, records and/or documents produced available for inspection and copying
by the Shareholders concurrently with the production of such books, records
and/or documents. In addition, if Buyer or the Company, or any of their
respective Affiliates, shall desire to dispose of any of such books or records
prior to the expiration of such seven-year period, Buyer shall, prior to such
disposition, give the Shareholders a reasonable opportunity to segregate and
remove such books and records as the Shareholders may select. Buyer shall not
be obligated to provide Shareholders with access to any books or records
(including personnel files) pursuant to this Section where such access would
violate any Law.

(b) Buyer shall provide to any Shareholder so requesting, reasonable
assistance, at such Shareholder's reasonable expense, by providing employees
of the Company to act as witnesses and preparing documents, reports and other
information requested by the Shareholder in support of the activities
described in Section 6.8(a).

(c) Any Shareholder may retain copies of any Contracts, documents or records
of the Company: (i) for archival purposes, (ii) which relate to properties or
activities of such Shareholder other than the Company, (iii) which are
required to be retained pursuant to any legal requirement or are subject to
the attorney-client privilege, or (iv) for financial reporting purposes, for
Tax purposes or for legal defense or prosecution purposes.

Section 6.9. Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Exculpation.

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing now existing in favor of the current or former
directors or officers (or persons holding similar positions) of the Company
have the right to indemnification by the Company (collectively, the "Covered
Persons") as provided in its Organizational Documents, indemnity or
indemnification agreements, as provided under Law or as provided pursuant to a
resolution of the board of directors (or similar governing body) of the
Company shall survive the transactions contemplated hereby and shall continue
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms for a period of not
less than six (6) years from the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, for
a period of not less than six (6) years from the Closing, Buyer shall not, and
shall not permit the Company to, amend, modify or terminate any Organizational
Document, Contract or resolution regarding or related to such indemnification
matters.



 (b) The provisions of this Section 6.9 are: (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Covered Person and each other Person
entitled to indemnification or coverage under a policy referenced in this
Section 6.9, and each such Person's heirs, legatees, representatives,
successors and assigns, it being expressly agreed that such Persons shall be
third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.9, and (ii) in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such Person may have by Contract or otherwise.

(c) If Buyer or its successors or assigns: (i) shall consolidate with or merge
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Buyer shall assume all of the obligations of Buyer set forth in
this Section 6.9.

Section 6.10. Employment Matters.

(a) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates or
the Company to: (i) provide coverage for Employees and their eligible
dependents under its or their medical, dental and health plans without
interruption of coverage; (ii) cause there to be waived any pre-existing
condition, actively at work requirements, waiting periods and any other
similar restriction; and (iii) cause the employee benefit plans, agreements,
programs, policies and arrangements of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (the
"Buyer Plans") to honor any expenses incurred by the Employees and their
eligible dependents under similar plans of the Company prior to the Closing in
the plan year in which the Closing occurs for purposes of satisfying
applicable deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket expenses, and
with respect to any lifetime maximums, as if there had been a single
continuous employer.

(b) For purposes of eligibility, level of benefits, vesting and benefit
accruals (other than benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan)
under each Buyer Plan in which Employees are eligible to participate following
the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates or the Company to,
give each Employee full credit under each such Buyer Plan for all service with
the Company, their Affiliates and any predecessor employer prior to the
Closing to the same extent as such service was recognized for such purpose by
the Company and/or their Affiliates prior to the Closing; provided, however,
that such service shall not be credited to the extent that it would result in
a duplication of benefits.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, nothing contained
in this Section 6.10(c) shall: (i) be deemed to be the adoption of, or an
amendment to, any employee benefit plan, program, arrangement, contract or
practice, or otherwise limit the right of the Company, Buyer or their
respective Affiliates, to amend, modify or terminate any employee benefit
plan, program, arrangement, contract or practice or (ii) give any third party
any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.10(c).

Section 6.11. Tax Matters.

(a) The Shareholder Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared all
Tax Returns required or permitted to be filed by the Company for taxable
periods ending prior to or on the Closing Date (a "Pre-Closing Tax Period")
which are to be filed after the Closing Date (the



 "Company Pre-Closing Tax Returns") in a manner consistent with the Company's
past practice, including the use of filing extensions, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law, and in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement; and the Buyer shall cause the Company to execute and file the
Company Pre-Closing Tax Returns. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company Pre-
Closing Tax Returns shall not include any personal Tax Return of the
Shareholders. The Company shall pay for the costs and expenses of preparing
and filing all Company Pre-Closing Tax Returns and the Shareholders shall pay
all Taxes reflected as due and payable on all Company Pre-Closing Tax Returns.
Each such Tax Return shall be subject to review by the Buyer prior to filing
and the Shareholder Representative shall make revisions to such Tax Returns as
are reasonably requested by the Buyer. The Shareholders shall include any
income, gain, loss, deduction or other Tax items for such Pre-Closing Tax
Period on their own Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Schedule K-1s
furnished by the Company to the Shareholders for such period. The parties
shall make available to each other (and to their respective accountants and
attorneys) any and all books and records and other documents and information
in its possession or control relating to the Company reasonably requested by
such Persons in order to prepare or review such Company Pre-Closing Tax
Returns. The Company shall be permitted to file amended Tax Returns of the
Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, provided, that, if such amendment
would affect the Tax liability of any Shareholder or trigger an
indemnification of the Company or the Buyer by the Shareholders, no amendment
of any such Tax Return shall be made without prior written consent of
Shareholder Representative, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

(b) Buyer or the Company shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and
filed when due all Tax Returns for the Company required to be filed for all
periods beginning after the Closing Date. Buyer shall pay and be liable for
(or shall cause the Company to pay) all Taxes of the Company with respect to
such periods or which arise in respect of any event, action, or transaction
which occurred during such periods.

(c) Buyer or the Company shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and
filed when due any Tax Returns of the Company for Tax periods which begin
before or on the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date (each such
period, a "Straddle Period") in a manner consistent with the Company's past
practice including the use of filing extensions, except as otherwise required
by applicable Law, and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
Taxes for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between the pre-Closing
portion of the Straddle Period (the "Pre-Closing Straddle Period"), which
shall be the liability of the Shareholders, and the post-Closing portion of
the Straddle Period, which shall be the liability of Buyer or the Company. The
amount of Taxes for the Pre-Closing Straddle Period ("Pre-Closing Straddle
Period Taxes") based on or measured by income, receipts, or payroll of the
Company shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the
close of business on the Closing Date, and (ii) the amount of other Pre-
Closing Straddle Period Taxes owed by the Shareholders shall be determined to
be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period
ending at the close of business on the Closing Date, and the denominator of
which is the total number of days in the entire Straddle Period. Each such Tax
Return shall be subject to review by the Shareholder Representative prior to
filing and the Company shall make revisions to such Tax Returns as are
reasonably requested by the Shareholder Representative.



 (d) Any refunds, overpayments and other cash recoveries of Pre-Closing
Straddle Period Taxes, or any Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, shall belong
to the Shareholders and be paid to them promptly upon receipt or recovery
thereof by Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates. Any refunds,
overpayments and other cash recoveries of Company Taxes for any other period
shall belong to the Company and shall be paid to them promptly upon receipt or
recovery thereof by any Shareholder or any of their Affiliates.

(e) Buyer shall promptly notify the Shareholder Representative following
receipt of any notice of audit or other proceeding relating to any Shareholder
Return or any other federal or state Tax Return filed on or before the Closing
Date (together with all Company Pre-Closing Tax Returns, the "Prior Period
Returns"). The Shareholder Representative shall control any and all audits or
other proceedings and litigation relating to any Prior Period Return,
including the filing of an amended Tax Return, and Buyer and Company shall
have the right to participate at their own cost. Buyer and the Shareholder
Representative shall have joint control of any and all audits or other
proceedings and litigation relating to a Tax Return for a Straddle Period or a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, including the filing of an amended Tax Return. Neither
the Shareholder Representative nor Buyer shall settle or compromise an audit
or other proceeding or litigation relating to a Prior Period Return, a Tax
Return for a Straddle Period, or a Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
without the consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(f) The parties shall cooperate (and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate) fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
parties, in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant
to this Section 6.11 and any Tax audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes and payments in respect thereof. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other parties' request) the provision of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Buyer, the Shareholders, and the Company shall
retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Company relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until
the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by
Buyer, any extensions thereof) plus 60 days of the respective taxable periods,
and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Governmental Authority. Each of the parties shall furnish the other parties
with copies of all relevant correspondence received from any Governmental
Authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with respect
to any Taxes for which any other party may have an indemnification obligation
under this Agreement. Buyer, the Shareholders, and the Company further agree,
upon request from another, to use their best efforts to obtain any certificate
or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may
be necessary or helpful to mitigate, reduce, or eliminate any Tax that could
be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement).

(g) All Tax-sharing and similar agreements with respect to or involving the
Company's Taxes shall be terminated as of the Closing Date, and after the
Closing Date, Buyer and the Company shall not be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder.

(h) The Shareholder Representative shall be responsible for the preparation
and filing of Tax Returns (including any documentation) with respect to all
transfer, documentation, sales,



 use, stamp, registration, recordation fees, and similar Taxes incurred in
connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. The
Shareholders on the one hand shall pay fifty percent (50%) of the amount of
any such Taxes when the Shareholder Representative files such Tax Returns and
Buyer on the other hand shall pay the other fifty percent (50%). Buyer and the
Company shall cooperate to the extent necessary in order for the Shareholders
Representative to file such Tax Returns.

Section 6.12. Section 338(h)(10) Election

(a) At the request of Buyer, the Shareholders shall join with Buyer in making
the elections (collectively the "338(h)(10) Election") with respect to the
purchase of the Shares under: (i) Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and (ii)
unless otherwise requested by Buyer, any analogous provision of state, local
or foreign income Tax law, to the extent that such election is separately
available and is not automatic based upon the federal 338(h)(10) Election, in
each state, local and foreign jurisdiction where the Company currently files
or is required to file income Tax Returns. The Shareholders shall include any
income, gain, loss deduction, or other tax item resulting from the 338(h)(10)
Election on their Tax Returns. Buyer and the Shareholders shall exchange
completed and executed copies of (A) IRS Form 8023 and IRS Form 8883 and
required schedules thereto and (B) to the extent required, any similar forms
with respect to state, local or foreign income Taxes.

(b) Buyer and the Shareholders agree that, except as Buyer and the Shareholder
Representative may otherwise agree in writing or as may be required otherwise
pursuant to a final determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code or corresponding provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law, for
United States federal income Tax purposes, the amount of the adjusted deemed
sale price (as determined pursuant to Treasury Regulations §1.338-4) for the
assets of the Company (collectively, the "Tax Purchase Price") deemed acquired
pursuant to the 338(h)(10) Election shall be allocated in accordance with
Treasury Regulations §§1.338-6 and 1.338-7 and in that connection further
agree that, as reflected on the Allocation Schedule: (i) the fair market
values of the assets of the Company included as assets in the determination of
Closing Working Capital are the values of such assets taken into account in
the determination, (ii) the fair market values of the assets of the Company
not taken into account in the determination of Closing Working Capital and
that are reflected as assets on the face of the Company's consolidated balance
sheet included in the Closing Statement are the values determined by Buyer as
part of its valuation of the Company's assets, and (iii) any excess of the Tax
Purchase Price over the sum of the fair market values agreed pursuant to
clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence shall be allocated solely to goodwill
and going concern value. Buyer, the Company, and the Shareholders agree that
the Purchase Price and the liabilities of the Company shall be allocated to
the assets of the Company as shown on the "Allocation Schedule" attached as
Section 6.12(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, which shall be amended consistent
with the methodology shown thereon upon the final determination of the Tax
Purchase Price related to the non-deferred portion of the Purchase Price, and
upon the payment of any Participation Payment and any associated redemption of
the Tax Purchase Price related to the payment of a Participation Payment.
Buyer, the Company, and the Shareholders shall file all Tax Returns (including
any amended Tax Returns or claims for refund) and information reports in a
manner consistent with such schedule. Except as Buyer and the Shareholder
Representative may otherwise agree or as may be required otherwise pursuant to
a final determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code or a
corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, the agreements
regarding fair market values



 and allocation required pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall
be binding on the Shareholders and Buyer for all Tax reporting purposes.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Shareholders shall
pay any Tax imposed on Company attributable to the making of the 338(h)(10)
Election, including (i) any Tax imposed under Code Section 1374, (ii) any tax
imposed under Treasury Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(2), (iii) any
depreciation or amortization recapture, or (iv) any state, local, or non-U.S.
tax imposed on Company's gain, and the Shareholders shall indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and the Company against any Loss arising out of any failure to
pay such Taxes.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, as part of the Tax
Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to the Shareholders, in
cash, at the time or times the Purchase Price is paid (including each time a
Participation Payment is paid), the actual amounts (such amounts, collectively
the "Tax Adjustment"), if any, necessary to cause the Shareholders' after-
income Tax net proceeds from the sale of the Shares pursuant to this
Agreement, taking into account the 338(h)(10) Election and all similar state,
local, and foreign elections, and all Taxes imposed on the Shareholders and
any state Taxes imposed on the Company as a result of the 338(h)(10) Election
(other than any state Tax that is equivalent to Section 1374 of the Code), to
be equal to the after-income Tax net proceeds that the Shareholders would have
received had the 338(h)(10) Election and all similar state, local, and foreign
elections not been made, taking into account all appropriate federal, state,
local and foreign income Tax deductions and implications (whether positive or
negative and whether resulting in greater or less tax liability), including
the application of federal and state tax attributes and state net operating
losses arising from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
including any income Taxes imposed on the Tax Adjustment, and using the
following assumptions: (A) only the items of income, gain, deduction, loss,
expense and credit or recapture of any of the foregoing items arising out of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be considered (including
without limitation any recognition of income, gain, deduction or loss or
change in character thereof as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the 338(h)(10) Election); and (B) the Shareholders shall be
treated as subject to the maximum combined federal and applicable state
marginal income tax rates (taking into account any netting for any federal
benefit of deducting state or local income Tax) at such time any Participation
Payment is paid. The Tax Adjustment shall be increased or decreased if
required due to any final determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code or corresponding provision of state, local or foreign income Tax
law, relating to a tax return filed by the Company.

(i) Within thirty (30) days after (A) the final determination of Closing
Working Capital in accordance with Article 2, and (B) the finalization of the
Participation Payment Calculation Statement pursuant to Section 2.6, the
Shareholder Representative shall provide to Buyer a schedule, with supporting
work papers, setting forth a calculation of the Tax Adjustment (the "Tax
Adjustment Schedule"). During the twenty (20) days following the receipt by
Buyer of the applicable Tax Adjustment Schedule, Buyer and the Shareholder
Representative shall meet and confer and attempt in good faith to agree upon
and finalize the Tax Adjustment Schedule. Within thirty (30) days after
receipt of such Tax Adjustment Schedule, Buyer shall notify the Shareholder
Representative whether Buyer concurs or disagrees with such Tax Adjustment
Schedule and, if applicable, the disagreements. If such disagreements cannot
be resolved between Buyer and the Shareholder Representative within ten (10)
days after delivery of notice by the Shareholder Representative to



 Buyer, the disagreements shall then be referred to the Accounting Expert,
which shall be selected in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section
2.6. The determination of the Accounting Expert shall be final and binding.
The fees of the Accounting Expert shall be borne by the Shareholders (in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares), on the one hand, and Buyer,
on the other hand, in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters
resolved by the Accounting Expert, which proportionate allocation shall be
calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the
amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the Accounting Expert at the
time the determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the matters
submitted.

(ii) Within twenty (20) days after Buyer and Shareholder Representative agree
on the Tax Adjustment Schedule for a payment, Buyer shall pay the Shareholders
the Tax Adjustment associated with such payment; provided, however, that if
Buyer and the Shareholder Representative cannot so agree and the Tax
Adjustment Schedule is referred to the Accounting Expert to resolve their
disagreements, then within twenty (20) days after referral to the Accounting
Expert, Buyer shall pay to the Shareholders the undisputed portion thereof;
and provided, further, Buyer shall pay any excess of the Tax Adjustment as so
finally determined to the Shareholders pursuant to the award of the Accounting
Expert within twenty (20) days after such award.

(iii) The obligations of Buyer to pay each Tax Adjustment shall survive until
the expiration of all statutes of limitation with respect to Tax Returns of
the Shareholders and the Company for the taxable years ending on or including
the Closing Date and each succeeding taxable year until no portion of the Tax
Purchase Price remains to be paid, to the extent necessary to adjust the
amount of the Tax Adjustment to reflect any final determination (as defined in
Section 1313(a) of the Code or comparable provisions of other Tax laws) that
would increase or decrease the amount of the Tax Adjustment had such final
determination been taken into account previously in the calculation of the Tax
Adjustment. The amount of any such adjustment shall be determined by the
preparation of a revised Tax Adjustment Schedule that takes into account such
final determination, pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Section 6.12
(commencing with the date of notice of such final determination in lieu of the
date the Closing Working Capital is determined), and Buyer shall pay any such
increase in the Tax Adjustment to the Shareholders, and the Shareholder
Representative shall pay any decrease in the Tax Adjustment to the Buyer,
within twenty (20) days after the amount of any such increase or decrease is
determined in accordance with such procedures. Buyer shall promptly provide
written notice to the Shareholder Representative of any audit or other
investigation that may be initiated in connection with the 338(h)(10) Election
or that may affect the amount of the Tax Adjustment.

Section 6.13. Further Assurances. Each of the parties shall execute and
deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances and
take such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the
provisions hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.14. RandW Insurance Policy. The parties shall cooperate as reasonably
required for Buyer to procure, effective as of the Closing, the RandW Insurance
Policy, which shall be substantially in the form set forth on Schedule 6.14.
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such policy as soon
as practicable after the date hereof.

Persons") and hold them harmless from and against any and all Losses incurred
or suffered by a Shareholder Indemnified Person resulting from or arising out
of:

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by Buyer
in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by Buyer at the Closing
pursuant hereto; and

following the Closing) the Company contained in this Agreement.

Section 8.4. Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) The Shareholders shall have no liability pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or (c)
with respect to Losses except to the extent that the aggregate amount of such
Losses exceeds an amount



 equal to $200,000 (the "Basket"), in which event the Shareholders shall be
required to pay or be liable for all such Losses from the first dollar;
provided, however, that this Section 8.4(a) shall not apply to breach or
inaccuracy of any Fundamental Representation.

(b) Huynh and the Huynh Trust together shall not have any liability pursuant
to Section 8.2(a) or (c) in an aggregate amount greater than $500,000, and
Duong shall not have any liability pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or (c) in an

Persons' only recourse in respect of any excess liability shall be with
respect to the RandW Insurance Policy; provided, however, that this Section
8.4(b) shall not apply to breach or inaccuracy of any Fundamental
Representation.

(c) Buyer shall have no liability pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with respect to
Losses except to the extent that the aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds
the Basket, in which event Buyer shall be required to pay or be liable for all
such Losses from the first dollar; provided, however, that this Section 8.4(c)
shall not apply to breach or inaccuracy of any Fundamental Representation.

(d) Buyer shall have no liability pursuant to Section 8.3(a) in an aggregate
amount greater than $1,000,000; provided, however, that this Section 8.4(d)
shall not apply to breach or inaccuracy of any Fundamental Representation.

(e) No Shareholder shall have liability pursuant to Section 8.2 in an
aggregate amount greater than the portion of the Purchase Price such
Shareholder actually receives.

(f) No Shareholder shall have any liability pursuant to Section 8.2(c) through

such Loss.

(g) No Shareholder shall have any liability pursuant to Section 8.2 with
respect to a Loss arising from any breach of a warranty, representation,
covenant or obligation of or relating to another Shareholder.

(h) For purposes of this Article 8, any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty other than any Fundamental Representation shall be
determined without regard to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other
similar qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to such
representation or warranty.

(i) No Shareholder shall have any liability pursuant to Section 8.2 with
respect to a Loss to the extent the amount of such Loss has been included in
the calculation of the Net Adjustment Amount (as finally determined and paid
in accordance with Article 2).

(j) For the avoidance of doubt, no portion of the Escrow Amount shall serve as
security for any obligations of the Shareholders under this Article 8, and in
no event may Buyer make a claim against all or any portion of the Escrow
Amount for or in connection with any claim or obligation under this Article 8.



 Section 8.5. Other Limitations.

(a) For all purposes of this Article 8, "Losses" shall be net of any amounts
actually received by an Indemnified Person under any insurance policy (other
than the RandW Insurance Policy) or Contract in connection with the facts giving
rise to the right of indemnification hereunder, and each Indemnified Person
shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to recover all amounts payable
from an insurer or other third party under any such insurance policy or
Contract prior to seeking indemnification hereunder; provided, however, that
the amount deemed to be paid under such insurance policies shall be net of the
deductible for such policies.

(b) In calculating any Loss, there shall be deducted any Tax benefit, credit
or refund to which the applicable Indemnified Person actually realizes or
receives as a result of such Loss in the year of the Loss or the subsequent
year.

(c) If the amount to be netted hereunder from any indemnification payment
required hereunder is determined after payment by an Indemnifying Person to an
Indemnified Person of any amount otherwise required to be paid as
indemnification pursuant hereto, the Indemnified Person shall repay, promptly
after such determination, any amount that the Indemnifying Person would not
have had to pay pursuant hereto had such determination been made at the time
of such payment.

(d) Notwithstanding the fact that any Indemnified Person may have the right to
assert claims for indemnification under or in respect of more than one
provision of this Agreement in respect of any fact, event, condition or
circumstance, no Indemnified Person shall be entitled to recover the amount of
any Loss suffered by such Indemnified Person more than once, regardless of
whether such Loss may be as a result of a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, obligation or covenant or otherwise. In addition,
any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
liability, or a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, as applicable.

(e) No Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any consequential, indirect,
incidental, special, unforeseen, exemplary or punitive damages, including
diminution of value, loss of business reputation or opportunity or any damages
based on any type of multiple, except in the case of fraud, criminal activity
or willful misconduct, or to the extent actually awarded to a Governmental
Authority or other third party.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations on indemnification set
forth in Section 8.4 and Section 8.5 shall not apply to Losses based upon,
arising out of, with respect to or by reason of any claim arising from fraud,
criminal activity or willful misconduct on the part of a party hereto.

Section 8.6. Third-Party Claim Indemnification Procedures.

(a) In the event that any written claim or demand for which a party (in such
capacity, an "Indemnifying Person") may have liability to any Indemnified
Person hereunder, other than those relating to Taxes (which are the subject of
Section 6.11), is asserted against or sought to be collected from any
Indemnified Person by a third party (a "Third-Party Claim"), such Indemnified
Person shall



 promptly, but in no event more than ten (10) days following such Indemnified
Person's receipt of a Third-Party Claim, notify the Indemnifying Person of
such Third-Party Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought
thereunder to the extent then ascertainable, any other remedy sought
thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating thereto, a reasonably
detailed explanation of the events giving rise to such Third-Party Claim and
any other material details pertaining thereto (a "Claim Notice"); provided,
however, that the failure to timely give a Claim Notice shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Person of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Person shall have been actually and materially prejudiced by
such failure or as provided in Section 8.1. Thereafter, the Indemnified Person
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Person, promptly following the Indemnified
Person's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the Indemnified Person relating to the Third-Party Claim.

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Person notifies the Indemnified Person
that it elects to defend the Indemnified Person against a Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Person shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Person
by appropriate proceedings and shall have the sole power to direct and control
such defense at its expense. Once the Indemnifying Person has made such
election, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to participate in (but
not control) any such defense and to employ separate counsel of its choosing
at such Indemnified Person's expense. The Indemnifying Person shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, settle,
compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim if the terms
of such settlement would result in: (i) the imposition of a consent order,
injunction or decree that would restrict the future activity or conduct of the
Indemnified Person or (ii) a finding or admission of a violation of Law by the
Indemnified Person that would have an adverse effect on the Indemnified
Person. Whether or not the Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of a Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnified Person shall not admit any liability with respect
to, settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim without the
Indemnifying Person's prior written consent. If the Indemnifying Person
assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim and is in good faith contesting
such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Person shall agree to any settlement,
compromise or discharge of a Third-Party Claim that the Indemnifying Person
may reasonably recommend and that by its terms (A) obligates the Indemnifying
Person to pay the full amount of Losses in connection with such Third-Party
Claim (other than with respect to any Losses (or portion thereof) that are not
required to be paid as a result of such Losses being (or portion thereof)
within the Basket or in excess of the applicable limitation set forth in
Section 8.4) and (B) releases the Indemnified Person in connection with such
Third-Party Claim.

(c) The Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person shall cooperate in
order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party Claim,
including by providing reasonable access to each other's relevant books and
records, and employees. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the Indemnifying Person's request) the provision to the Indemnifying Person of
books and records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third-
Party Claim, and making employees and Representatives available on a mutually
convenient basis during normal business hours to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The
Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person shall use reasonable commercial
efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with
applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and
others representing any party to a Third-Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.



 Section 8.7. Direct Claim Indemnification Procedures. Each Indemnified Person
shall assert any claim on account of any Losses which do not result from a
Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") by giving the Indemnifying Person written
notice thereof reasonably promptly (and, in any event, no later than thirty
(30) days following the Indemnified Person's discovery of the applicable
Losses reasonably likely to give rise to a claim under this Article 8). Such
notice by the Indemnified Person shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable
detail, include copies of all available material written evidence thereof and
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of Losses that have
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Person; provided, however, that
the failure to timely give such notice shall not affect the rights of an
Indemnified Person hereunder except: (a) to the extent such failure has a
prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available to the
Indemnifying Person with respect to such Direct Claim or on the Indemnifying
Person's ability to mitigate such Direct Claim, (b) to the extent the
indemnification obligations are materially increased as a result of such
failure, or (c) as provided in Section 8.1.

Section 8.8. Investigation by Indemnifying Parties. In connection with any
claim pursuant to this Article 8:

(a) The Indemnified Persons shall allow the Indemnifying Person and its
financial, accounting or legal advisers to investigate the fact, matter or
circumstance alleged to (or which may) give rise to such claim and whether and
to what extent any amount is or may be payable in respect of such claim.

(b) The Indemnified Persons shall provide such information and assistance as
the Indemnifying Person or its financial, accounting or legal advisers shall
reasonably request, including:

(i) access to premises and personnel (including any employee with knowledge
relating to the relevant facts, matters or circumstances or who can otherwise
reasonably assist the Indemnifying Person); and

(ii) the right to examine and copy or photograph any relevant assets,
accounts, correspondence, documents and records.

Section 8.9. [Reserved]

Section 8.10. Characterization of Indemnification Payments. All payments made
(or deemed to be made, in accordance with this Agreement) by any Indemnifying
Person to an Indemnified Person with respect to any claim pursuant to Section
8.2 or Section 8.3 shall be treated, to the fullest extent possible under
applicable Law, as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

Section 8.11. Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, except as provided in Section 2.3 (Post-Closing Determination),
Section 2.5 (Participation Payments), and Section 6.6 (Non-Competition), from
and after the Closing the rights and remedies of Buyer, the Company and the
Shareholders, and any Buyer Indemnified Person and any Shareholder Indemnified
Person (each Buyer Indemnified Person and Shareholder Indemnified Person is
referred to herein as an "Indemnified Person"), under this Article 8 are
exclusive and in lieu of any and all other rights and remedies which Buyer,
the Company or the Shareholders, or any Indemnified Person, may have under
this Agreement or any Transaction Document or otherwise against each other
with respect to



 this Agreement or any Transaction Document and with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and each party expressly waives
and releases and agrees to waive and release any and all other rights or
causes of action it or its Affiliates may have against the other party or its
Affiliates now or in the future under any Law (regardless of the theory of
recourse) with respect to the preceding matters. Nothing in this Section shall
limit any Person\'s right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any
Person shall be entitled or to seek any remedy on account of any party\'s
fraudulent, criminal, or willful misconduct.

ARTICLE 9 
TERMINATION

Section 9.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

(b) by Buyer or the Shareholders if there shall be any Law that makes

otherwise prohibited, or any Governmental Authority shall have issued an order
enjoining the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such order
shall have become final and non-appealable;

(c) by Buyer or the Shareholders, by giving written notice of such termination
to the other parties, on or after March 31, 2016 (the "Outside Date"), if the

representation or warranty shall have become untrue in any material respect
after the date of this Agreement) or of any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement (or in the case of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, any violation
or breach thereof) which, in either case, would prevent the satisfaction of or
result in the failure of any condition to the obligations of Buyer at the
Closing and such violation or breach has not been waived by Buyer or, in the
case of a breach of any covenant or agreement under this Agreement that is
curable, has not been cured prior to the earlier to occur of: (i) thirty (30)
days after receipt by the Company or the Shareholder, as applicable, of
written notice of such breach from Buyer and (ii) the Outside Date; provided,
however, that Buyer may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.1(d) at any time during which Buyer is in material breach of this Agreement;
or

(e) by the Shareholders, if there has been a material violation or breach by
Buyer of any representation or warranty (or any such representation or
warranty shall have become untrue in any material respect after the date of
this Agreement) or covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement (or in
the case of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement qualified by
materiality or Material Adverse Effect, any violation or breach thereof) which
would, in either case, prevent the satisfaction of or result in the failure of
any condition to the obligations of the Shareholders



 at the Closing and such violation or breach has not been waived by the
Shareholder Representative or, with respect to a breach of any covenant or
agreement under this Agreement that is curable, has not been cured by Buyer
prior to the earlier to occur of: (i) thirty (30) days after receipt by Buyer
of written notice of such breach from the Company or (ii) the Outside Date;
provided, however, that the Shareholders may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.1(e) at any time during which the Company or a
Shareholder is in material breach of this Agreement.

Section 9.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1, this Agreement shall thereafter
become void and have no effect, and no party shall have any liability to the
other party or their respective Affiliates, or their respective directors,
officers, shareholders partners, members, attorneys, accountants, agents,
representatives or employees or their heirs, successors and permitted assigns,
except for the obligations of the parties contained in Section 6.4 (Public
Disclosure; Confidentiality), this Section 9.2 and Article 10 (Miscellaneous)
(and any related definitional provisions set forth herein), and except that
nothing in this Section 9.2 shall relieve either party from liability for any
willful breach of this Agreement that arose prior to such termination.

ARTICLE 10

"Shareholder Representative") with respect to those provisions of this
Agreement that contemplate action by the Shareholder Representative and with
respect to the Escrow Agreement; provided, however, that if Duong at any time
is unable, due to incapacity or otherwise, to serve as Shareholder
Representative or resigns as Shareholder Representative, then Huynh shall

Shareholder, by operation of Law, whether by such Shareholder's death,
disability, protective supervision or any other event. The Shareholder
Representative shall promptly deliver to each Shareholder any notice received
by the Shareholder Representative concerning this Agreement. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Shareholder Representative has full power

Shareholder Representative shall not be liable to any Shareholder relating to
the performance of the Shareholder Representative's duties under this
Agreement for any errors in judgment, negligence, oversight, breach of duty or
otherwise except to the extent it is finally determined in a court of
competent jurisdiction by clear and convincing evidence that the actions taken
or not taken by the Shareholder Representative constituted actual fraud or
were taken or not taken in bad faith. The Shareholder Representative shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Shareholders against all losses,
including costs of defense, paid or incurred in connection with any action,
suit, proceeding or claim to which the Shareholder Representative is made a
party by reason of the fact that the Shareholder Representative was acting as

Section 10.3. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including all Schedules,
Exhibits and Appendices hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement and the
Transaction Documents contain the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters.

Section 10.4. Amendment; Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by Buyer, the Company and the Shareholder
Representative, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom such
waiver is intended to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege.

Section 10.5. No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective
successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other parties and any purported assignment in violation of the foregoing shall
be null and void ab initio. Except as expressly set forth herein in Section
6.7 or Article 8, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to confer upon any Person other than Buyer, the Company and the Shareholders,
and their respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns,
any rights, benefits or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 10.6. Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the party incurring
such costs and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary herein, (a) all filing fees and similar expenses to be paid in
connection with the HSR Act shall be paid by Buyer, and (b) Buyer shall pay
fifty percent (50%) of all fees and expenses relating to the Escrow Agent, and
the Shareholder Representative shall be responsible for the other fifty
percent (50%) of such fees and expenses.





 Section 10.7. Disclosure Schedule.

(a) The "Disclosure Schedule" means that certain document (as may be modified
from time to time in accordance with the terms hereof) identified as the
Disclosure Schedule, dated as of the date hereof, delivered by the Company and
the Shareholders to Buyer in connection with this Agreement. Each Section in
the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to qualify the corresponding Section
of this Agreement and shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any
other Section of the Disclosure Schedule to which the application of such
disclosure is reasonably apparent.

(b) Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
the Disclosure Schedule is intended to vary the definition of "Material
Adverse Effect" or to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or
the item so included or other items, are or are not material, and no party
shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of
any such item in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether
any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the
Disclosure Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.
Unless this Agreement specifically provides otherwise, neither the
specification of any item or matter in any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the
Disclosure Schedule is intended to imply that such item or matter, or other
items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of business, and no
party shall use the fact of the setting forth or the inclusion of any such
item or matter in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether
any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the
Disclosure Schedule is or is not in the ordinary course of business for
purposes of this Agreement.

(c) Each Section of the Disclosure Schedule is qualified in its entirety by
reference to specific provisions of this Agreement and does not constitute,
and shall not be construed as constituting, representations, warranties or
covenants of any party, except as and to the extent provided in this
Agreement. Certain matters set forth in the Disclosure Schedule are included
for informational purposes only notwithstanding that, because they do not rise
above applicable materiality thresholds or otherwise, they may not be required
by the terms of this Agreement to be set forth herein. All attachments to the
Disclosure Schedule are incorporated by reference into the Section of the
Disclosure Schedule in which they are referenced.

(d) The Company and the Shareholders shall, from time to time prior to or at
the Closing, by notice to Buyer, supplement, amend or create any Section of
the Disclosure Schedule, in order to add information or correct previously
supplied information which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the
Disclosure Schedule. No such supplement, amendment or addition shall be
evidence, in and of itself, that the representations and warranties in the
corresponding section are no longer true and correct in all material respects.
It is specifically agreed that the Disclosure Schedule may be supplemented,
amended and/or added to, to add immaterial, as well as material, items
thereto. No such supplement, amendment or addition shall be deemed to cure any
breach for purposes of Section 7.2(a). If, however, the Closing occurs, any
such supplement, amendment or addition, to the extent it discloses facts,
circumstances, matters, events, or issues that together with all such other
supplements, amendments or additions give rise to Buyer's right to terminate
this Agreement, shall be effective to cure and correct for all other purposes
any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty, or covenant



 which would have existed if such supplement, amendment or addition had not
been made, and all references to any part of the Disclosure Schedule which is
supplemented or amended shall for all purposes after the Closing be deemed to
be a reference to the Disclosure Schedule as so supplemented or amended. In
such case, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any and all rights, remedies
or other recourse to which Buyer might otherwise be entitled in respect of
such breach or inaccuracy. If, however, the Closing occurs, any such
supplement, amendment or addition to the Disclosure Schedule that does not in
the aggregate with all such other supplements, amendments or additions give
rise to Buyer's right to terminate this Agreement shall not be deemed to have
cured any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant
for purposes of the indemnification rights contained in this Agreement, and
Buyer shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses resulting therefrom
in accordance with Article 8.

Section 10.8. Governing Law; Arbitration; Submission to Jurisdiction.

(a) This Agreement and all Actions arising out of or relating to this
Agreement ("Agreement Proceedings") shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the internal laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to

conflicts of laws principles of such state.

however, that if the amount involved in the dispute is less than $5,000,000,

except as necessary to give effect to res judicata and collateral estoppel, in

permissible by the court. Nothing in this Section 10.8(c) is intended to, or
shall, preclude a party to the arbitration from communicating with, or making
disclosures to his or its lawyers, tax advisors, auditors and insurers, as
necessary and appropriate or from making such other disclosures as may be
required by any applicable law.

(d) To the maximum extent permitted by Law, the decision of the arbitrator
shall be final and binding and not be subject to appeal. If a party against
whom the arbitrator renders an award fails to abide by such award, the other
party may seek to enforce such award in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(e) Except as otherwise provided herein, the successful or prevailing party in
any Agreement Proceeding shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys\'
fees and other costs incurred in that Agreement Proceeding.



 (f) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each party hereby: (i)
irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of the applicable
state or federal courts sitting in Los Angeles County, California, for
purposes of all Agreement Proceedings, (ii) agrees not to commence any
proceeding except in such courts and (iii) irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any objection which such party may now or hereafter
have to the laying of the venue of any such court or that such proceeding has
been brought in an inconvenient forum.

including the secured folders located therein ("Data Room"), (ii) the
provision of access to hard copies of such items or



 information, or (iii) the provision of such items or information in electronic
format (including by fax, e-mail or by other electronic means).

Section 10.10. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more

transmission or email (including in PDF format), shall be deemed an original,
and all of which shall constitute one and the same Agreement.

provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

Section 10.12. Time of Essence. Time is of the essence for each and every
provision of this Agreement.

Section 10.13. No Rescission. After the Closing, no party shall be entitled to
rescind the transactions contemplated hereby by virtue of any failure of any
party's representations and warranties herein to have been true or any failure
by any party to perform its obligations hereunder.

Section 10.14. Legal Representation. Sheppard, Mullin, Richter and Hampton LLP
("SMRH") has acted as counsel for the Shareholders and the Company in
connection with this Agreement (the "Acquisition Engagement"). SMRH has also
represented, on or prior to the Closing, the Company in respect of other
matters ("Company Engagements").

(a) Acquisition Engagement. Only the Shareholders and the Company shall be
considered clients of SMRH in the Acquisition Engagement. All communications
between Shareholders or the Company and SMRH in the course of the Acquisition
Engagement shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong
solely to the Shareholders and not the Company. Accordingly, Buyer shall not
have access to any such communications, or to the files of SMRH relating to
the Acquisition Engagement, whether or not the Closing occurs. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing: (i) the
Shareholders and SMRH shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client
privilege with respect to the Acquisition Engagement, and neither the Company
nor Buyer shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of SMRH in
respect of the Acquisition Engagement constitute property of the client, only
the Shareholders shall hold such property rights, and (iii) SMRH shall have no
duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications
or files to the Company or Buyer by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between SMRH and the Company or otherwise.

(b) Company Engagements. The parties acknowledge the community of interest
between the Company and the Shareholders in view of the fact that the
Shareholders hold all the equity of the Company. Accordingly, Buyer agrees
that the principles that apply to the Acquisition Engagement regarding client
confidences, attorney-client communications, attorney-client privilege,



 client files and disclosures shall also apply to Company Engagements. Thus,
notwithstanding that the Company is or was a client in the Company
Engagements, from and after the Closing: (i) all communications between the
Shareholders or the Company and SMRH in the course of all Company Engagements
shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the
Shareholders and not the Company, (ii) Buyer shall not have access to any such
communications, or to the files of SMRH relating to any Company Engagement,
(iii) the Shareholders and SMRH shall be the sole holders of the attorney-
client privilege with respect to each Company Engagement, and neither the
Company nor Buyer shall be a holder thereof, (iv) to the extent that files of
SMRH in respect of any Company Engagement constitute property of the client,
only the Shareholders shall hold such property rights, and (v) SMRH shall have
no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files to the Company or Buyer by reason of any attorney-
client relationship between SMRH and the Company or otherwise.

(c) Post-Closing Representation of the Shareholders Including Matters Relating
to the Acquisition. If the Shareholders so desire, and without the need for
any consent or waiver by the Company or Buyer, SMRH shall be permitted to
represent the Shareholders after the Closing in connection with any matter,
including without limitation anything related to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the Closing, SMRH shall be
permitted to represent the Shareholders, any of their agents and affiliates,
or any one or more of them, in connection with any matter whatsoever,
including, without limitation, any negotiation, transaction or dispute
("dispute" includes litigation, arbitration, mediation, negotiation or other
adversary proceeding) with Buyer, the Company or any of their agents or
Affiliates under or relating to this Agreement, any transaction contemplated
by this Agreement, and any related matter (such as claims for indemnification
and disputes involving employment or noncompetition or other agreements
entered into in connection with this Agreement), whether or not such matter is
related to the Acquisition Engagement or any Company Engagement.

(d) Cessation of Attorney-Client Relationship With the Company. Upon and after
the Closing, the Company shall cease to have any attorney-client relationship
with SMRH, including with respect to any Company Engagements, unless after the
Closing SMRH is subsequently engaged in writing by the Company to represent
the Company and either such engagement involves no conflict of interest with
respect to the Shareholders or the Shareholders consent in writing to such
engagement. Any such representation of the Company by SMRH after Closing shall
not affect the provisions of this Section 10.14. For example, and not by way
of limitation, even if SMRH is representing the Company after the Closing,
SMRH shall be permitted simultaneously to represent the Shareholders in any
matter, including, without limitation, any disagreement or dispute relating to
this Agreement. Furthermore, SMRH shall be permitted to withdraw from any
Company Engagement in order to be able to represent or continue so
representing the Shareholders even if such withdrawal causes the Company or
Buyer additional legal expense (such as to bring new counsel "up to speed"),
delay or other prejudice.

(e) Consent and Waiver of Conflicts of Interest. The Shareholders, the Company
and Buyer consent to the arrangements in this Section and waive any actual or
potential conflict of interest that may be involved in connection with any
representation by SMRH permitted hereunder.
