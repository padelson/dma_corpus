NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

SECTION 1.01. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), the Company shall be merged with and
into Parent at the Effective Time. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of the Company shall cease and Parent shall continue as
the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

SECTION 1.02. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 9:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by the parties,
which shall be no later than the third Business Day after satisfaction or (to
the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law) waiver of those conditions);  _provided_ that in
the event that (a) the condition set forth in Section 6.01(d) is the final
condition set forth in Article VI that is satisfied or waived (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law)
waiver of those conditions), then the Closing shall be required to occur no
later than the tenth Business Day following such satisfaction or waiver
and (b) on the date on which all of the conditions set forth in Article VI
have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms
are to be satisfied at Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of those conditions), Parent has
not completed its Marketing Period, then the Closing shall be required to
occur no later than the earlier to occur of (x) the tenth Business Day
following the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions set forth in Article
VI and (y) the third Business Day following the last day of the Marketing
Period; _provided further however_ that if the Closing has not occurred prior
to the Outside Date and all of the conditions set forth in Article VI are
satisfied or waived on the third Business Day prior to the Outside Date, then
the Closing shall be required to occur on the Outside Date. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Closing may be consummated at such other 

 



2  time or date as Parent and the Company may agree. The date on which the
Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ". The
Closing shall be held at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425
Lexington Ave., New York, New York 10017, unless another place is agreed to by
Parent and the Company.

SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
at the Closing the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger
(the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), in such form as required by, and executed
and acknowledged by the parties in accordance with, the relevant provisions of
the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the
DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective upon the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware or at such later time as Parent and the Company shall agree and
shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes
effective being hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time,
all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the
Company and Parent shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Parent shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

(a) At the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended, of Parent shall be amended so as to read in its
entirety as set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto, and as so amended shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by applicable Law
(subject to Section 5.05).

(b) The Amended and Restated By-laws, as amended, of Parent in effect at the
Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and as provided by
applicable Law (subject to Section 5.05).

SECTION 1.06. _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be.

SECTION 1.07. _Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The officers of
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be.

 



3 ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT

 

CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any shares of
the Companys Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Company Common
Stock_ "), or of any shares of capital stock of Parent:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Parent_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Parent outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company or that is directly
or indirectly owned by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor; _provided_ for the avoidance of
doubt, that no shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by a Subsidiary
which is directly or indirectly wholly owned by the Company shall be canceled
pursuant to this Section 2.01(b).

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_.

 

(i) Subject to Section 2.02(e), each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding (1) shares
to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and (2) any Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive (A) 0.402 (the "
_Exchange Ratio_ ") validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Parent Common Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ ") and (B) $4.75 in cash,
without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ " and, together with the Stock
Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all
shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.01(c) shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ ") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends
or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu
of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e), without
interest, in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.02(b), in the case
of certificated shares, and automatically, in the case of book-entry shares.

 

(ii) In the event that between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, there is a change in the number of shares of Parent Common Stock or
Company Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding 

 



4  as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer
tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such action.

(iii) The right of any holder of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(e) shall, to the extent provided in Section 2.02(j), be subject
to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under
applicable Tax Law.

(iv) At the Effective Time, subject to and in accordance with Section 5.04,
all Company Stock Options (including those former Holdings Stock Options)
issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent.

(d) _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(i) Shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders who have not voted
in favor of or consented to the adoption of this Agreement and who are
entitled to demand and have properly demanded their rights to be paid the fair
value of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be canceled and converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof
shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the
DGCL; _provided, however_ , that if any such stockholder of the Company shall
fail to perfect or shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such
stockholders rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholders
Dissenting Shares in respect of which the stockholder would otherwise be
entitled to receive fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon
be deemed to have been canceled, at the Effective Time, and the
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, as
applicable (payable without any interest thereon), as compensation for such
cancellation.

(ii) The Company shall give Parent reasonably prompt notice of any notice
received by the Company of intent to demand the fair value of any shares of
Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such notices and any other instruments
or notices served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and Parent shall direct
negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights
under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by an Order, (x) make any
payment or other commitment with respect to any such exercise of appraisal

the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares, book-entry shares (or certificates if requested) representing

to time at or after the Effective Time, any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares
payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e). All shares of Parent Common Stock, cash,
dividends and distributions deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to
this Section 2.02(a) shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_ ". The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Parent Common Stock, cash,
dividends and distributions contemplated to be issued and delivered pursuant
to Sections 2.01 and 2.02(c) out of the Exchange Fund. Except to the extent
set forth in Section 2.02(h), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i)  _Certificates_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e) (i) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in customary form
and contain customary provisions) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration,
any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e).
Each holder of record of one or more Certificates shall, upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of such Certificate or Certificates, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange
therefor as promptly as practicable (i) the amount of cash to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(c), (ii) shares of Parent
Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a
physical certificate is requested by such holder of record) representing, in
the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (after taking into account all shares of
Company Common Stock then held by such holder), (iii) any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and (iv) cash in lieu of
any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e), and the

surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
transfer or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.02(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable
pursuant to Section 2.02(e). No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any
payment to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article
II.

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this Article II. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of
one or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Common Stock were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of
any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e) shall automatically
upon the Effective Time (or, at any later time at which such Book-Entry Shares
shall be so converted) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time (i) the amount of cash to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.01(c), (ii) shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall
be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested by such holder of record) representing, in the aggregate, the whole
number of shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.01(c) (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then
held by such holder), (iii) any dividends or distributions payable pursuant
to Section 2.02(c) and (iv) cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable
pursuant to Section 2.02(e), and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall
forthwith be canceled. 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares
of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares
of Parent Common Stock that the holder thereof has the right to receive upon
the surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section
2.02(e), in each case until the holder of such Certificate shall have
surrendered such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Following
the surrender of any Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of
the certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock, issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of such surrender,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock, and the amount of any cash

 



7  payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and (B) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Holders of Book-Entry Shares who are entitled to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock under this Article II shall be paid (A)
at the time of payment of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent under
Section 2.02(b), the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock, and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a
fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to the time of such payment by the Exchange Agent
under Section 2.02(b) and a payment date subsequent to the time of such
payment by the Exchange Agent under Section 2.02(b) payable with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(e) paid upon the surrender of Certificates (or automatically, in
the case of Book-Entry Shares) in accordance with the terms of this Article
II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates or such Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to the
Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have
been declared or made by the Company on the shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time. At
the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall
be canceled against delivery of and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares or book-entry credit of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or upon the conversion of Book-Entry
Shares, no dividends or other distributions of Parent shall relate to such
fractional share interests and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent.
Each holder of Company Common Stock who otherwise would have been entitled to
a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall receive in lieu thereof
cash (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after
taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by all Certificates surrendered by such holder and all Book-Entry Shares
formerly held by such holder that are converted) would otherwise be entitled
by (B) the per share closing price of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq
Global Select Market on the last trading day immediately prior to the Closing
Date.

 



8 (f) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for twelve
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and
any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with
this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall
remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash
in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e) in
accordance with this Article II.

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of
Parent Common Stock, cash, dividends or other distributions from the Exchange
Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have
been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which any Merger
Consideration (and any dividends or other distributions payable with
respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.02(e))
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity),
any such shares (and any dividends or other distributions payable with
respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional
shares payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.02(e)) shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(h)  _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to and be income of
Parent;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of such cash shall in
all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term
obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that
no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders
of Certificates or Book Entry Shares pursuant to this Article II. If for any
reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient
to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the
Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the
Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of
cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such

 



9  lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash
in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e), in each
case pursuant to this Article II.

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to
be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, the Treasury Regulations thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate Taxing Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

in the Parent SEC Documents filed or furnished with the SEC since January 1,
2010 and publicly available at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date
of this Agreement (but excluding any forward-looking disclosure set forth in
any risk factor section, any disclosures in any section relating to forward-
looking statements and any other disclosures included therein to the extent
they are predictive or forward-looking in nature), and except as set forth in
the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to the Company concurrently with
the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being
understood that any items or matters set forth in one Section or subsection of
the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the
Section or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds and each other
Section or subsection of this Agreement to the extent the relevance of such
items or matters to such other Section or subsection of this Agreement is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure), Parent represents and
warrants to the Company as follows:

 

(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries has been duly organized and is validly existing and in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize that concept) under the
Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation, as the case may
be, and has all requisite power and authority necessary to enable it to use
its corporate or other name and to own, lease or otherwise hold and operate
its properties and other assets and to carry on its business as currently
conducted, except, in the case of Subsidiaries that, individually or in the
aggregate, do not own more than 5% of the consolidated assets of Parent and
its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010, where the failure to be so
organized, existing and in good standing, or to have such power and authority,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize that concept) in each
jurisdiction in which the conduct or nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation

 



28  of its properties or other assets makes such qualification, licensing or
good standing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed
or in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize that
concept) individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has made
available to the Company, prior to the date of this Agreement, true, complete
and accurate copies of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
of Parent (the " _Parent Certificate_ ") and the Amended and Restated By-laws
of Parent (the " _Parent Bylaws_ "), in each case as amended to the date

owned by Parent. All the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of,
or other equity interests in, each such Subsidiary owned by Parent have been
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and free of any preemptive
rights, and are owned directly or indirectly by Parent free and clear of all
Liens, and free of any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise
dispose of such capital stock or other equity interests. Each of Parent and
its Subsidiaries does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or
other equity interest in any person other than the Subsidiaries set forth in
Section 3.02(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter.

Parent; and

(E) except as set forth above in this Section 3.02(c) and except for changes

pursuant to Parent Stock Options or the settlement of restricted stock units
as expressly permitted by Section 4.01(b), (x) there are not issued, reserved
for issuance or outstanding (A) any shares of capital stock or other voting

a Parent Stock Option or for purposes of satisfying Tax withholding
obligations with respect to holders of Parent Stock Options or restricted
stock units). All outstanding Parent Stock Options are evidenced by stock
option agreements or other award agreements. There are no bonds, debentures,
notes or other indebtedness of Parent having the right to vote (or

Agreement to the earlier to occur of (i) the date of the termination of this
Agreement and (ii) the Effective Time, except as set forth in this Section
4.01(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter or as consented to in writing by the
Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or

 



46  delayed) or as otherwise permitted, contemplated or required by this
Agreement or required by Law, Parent shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, carry on its business in the ordinary course consistent with
past practice and in compliance with all material Laws and all material

extent consistent therewith, use commercially reasonable efforts to
preserve intact its current business organization and goodwill, keep
available the services of its current officers, employees and consultants and

addition to and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the
period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier to occur of (i) the date

(vi) authorize any of, or commit or agree to take any of, the foregoing
actions.

(c) _Other Actions_. Except as permitted by Section 4.02, the Company
and Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of their respective
Subsidiaries to, take any action or fail to take any action that could
reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to the Merger set
forth in Article VI not being satisfied or that could otherwise be reasonably
expected to prevent or delay the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 4.02. _Takeover Proposals_.

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 4.02(a), the Company agrees
that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its and their
respective directors or officers shall, and the Company shall cause its
financial advisor and each of the Blackstone Entities and each of its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective managers and officers not to, and
shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly through
another person (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or knowingly
facilitate any Takeover Proposal or the making or consummation thereof or (ii)
other than to inform any person of the existence of the provisions
contained in this Section 4.02, enter into, continue or otherwise participate
in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any
information in connection with, or enter into any agreement, understanding or
arrangement with respect to, any Takeover Proposal. Upon execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective directors and officers to, and shall direct and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries other
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore
with respect to any Takeover Proposal. The Company shall enforce the terms of
any existing standstill or similar agreement it has entered into with any
party, and the Company shall not amend or otherwise modify any such standstill
or similar agreement unless the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the directors of the Company under
applicable Law. The Company shall promptly, and in any event within 7 days,
request, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause, the prompt
return or written acknowledgement of destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished to such parties or their Representatives in
connection with any Takeover Proposal to the extent that the Company is
entitled to have such documents returned or destroyed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
(i) the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide Takeover Proposal from any
third party and (ii) the Special Committee or the Board of Directors of the
Company,

 



48  acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, determines in good
faith that (A) (after consultation with its financial advisor (including at
least one financial advisor who is not, and whose affiliates are not,
proposing to provide debt or equity financing in connection with such Takeover
Proposal) and outside legal counsel), such Takeover Proposal constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel), the failure to provide non-
public information concerning the Company or enter into discussions or
negotiations with such third party would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under Law, the Company may (x) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person
making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (except that the Company may enter
into a confidentiality agreement without a standstill provision or with a
standstill provision less favorable to the Company if it waives or similarly
modifies the standstill provision in the Confidentiality Agreement) (an "
_Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "); provided, that, subject to
applicable Law, all such information has previously been provided to Parent
or is provided to Parent promptly, and in any event within 24 hours after the
time it is provided to the person making such Takeover Proposal or such
persons Representatives, and (y) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall,
promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, upon receipt of any Takeover
Proposal, notify Parent orally and in writing, which notice shall specify the
terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal (including the identity of
the party making such Takeover Proposal and a copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements, if any, received by the Company or
its Representatives in connection with such Takeover Proposal).

The term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal, indication of
interest or offer concerning (i) a merger, consolidation or other business
combination, tender offer, exchange offer, recapitalization, reorganization or
any transaction involving the purchase or acquisition of 20% or more of the
shares of Company Common Stock, including as a result of a primary issuance of
Company Common Stock, or (ii) a direct or indirect purchase or acquisition of
20% or more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole (other than any such proposal or offer made by Parent or any of its
Affiliates).

The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Takeover
Proposal which the Special Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company,
acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, concludes in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel), taking into account (A) any proposal by Parent to amend or modify
the terms of this Agreement, (B) the terms, conditions, timing, likelihood of
consummation and all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects,
including financing certainty, of the Takeover Proposal and (C) the person
making the Takeover Proposal, (i) would, if consummated, be more favorable to
the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) is reasonably capable of
being completed on the terms proposed ( _provided_ that for the purpose of
this definition, references to "20%" in the definition of Takeover Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "50%").

 



49 (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor the Special Committee
shall withdraw or modify or qualify (or publicly propose to withdraw or
modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to Parent the Company Recommendation
(a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ _"_ ); except that at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Special Committee or
the Board of Directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a bona fide Takeover Proposal if the
Special Committee or the Board of Directors, acting upon the recommendation
of the Special Committee, concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor (including at least one financial advisor who is not, and
whose Affiliates are not, proposing to provide debt or equity financing in
connection with such Takeover Proposal) and outside legal counsel, that (1)
such Takeover Proposal would, if consummated, constitute a Superior Proposal
and (2) the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under Law. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, neither the Board of Directors nor the Special
Committee shall be entitled to exercise its right to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(e) unless (i) the Company notifies Parent in writing, at least three
Business Days before taking such action, of its intention to do so (which
notice shall specify in reasonable detail the terms and conditions of the
Takeover Proposal giving rise to the intention to take such action (including
the identity of the party making such Takeover Proposal and a copy of the
relevant proposed transaction agreements, if any, received by the Company or
its Representatives in connection with such Takeover Proposal), and (ii)
during such three Business Day period the Company and its financial advisors
and outside counsel negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
so desires to negotiate) to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that the Special Committee or the Board of Directors of the
Company, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee,
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
(including at least one financial advisor who is not, and whose affiliates are
not, proposing to provide debt or equity financing in connection with such
Takeover Proposal) and outside counsel) that such Takeover Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal; _provided_ that in the event any material
revisions are made to such Takeover Proposal, the Company shall be required to
deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of
this Section 4.02(b) with respect to such new written notice. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the obligation of the Company to deliver a new written notice
to Parent and to provide a new three Business Day period under this Section
4.02(b) shall apply only once with respect to a particular Takeover Proposal
(after giving effect to any amendment, modification or change to such Takeover
Proposal, made within such three Business Day period, that would require the
Company to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the
requirements of this Section 4.02(b) with respect to such new written notice),
regardless of any subsequent amendment, modification or change to
such Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Company shall not be entitled to enter into any agreement (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to a Superior Proposal
unless this Agreement has been or is concurrently terminated by its terms
pursuant to Section 7.1, and, if required pursuant to Section 7.3, the Company
has paid, or concurrently pays, to Parent the Company Termination Fee.

 

(c) Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, (i) the
obligation of the Company to call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholders Meeting and to hold a vote of the Companys stockholders
on the adoption of this Agreement at

 



50  the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be limited or otherwise affected
by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to it of any
Takeover Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal), or by a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, and (ii) in any case in which the Company makes
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 4.02, the
Company shall nevertheless submit this Agreement to a vote of its
stockholders; _provided_ that the Company shall not be obligated to recommend
to its stockholders the adoption of this Agreement at the Company
Stockholders Meeting or to include such a recommendation in the Joint
Proxy Statement if the Special Committee or the Board of Directors of the
Company, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, makes a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed of any material developments with respect to any Takeover Proposal.
The Company shall not, and shall cause the Companys Subsidiaries not to,
enter into any Contract with any person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing such information to
Parent.

(e) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any person from the
restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL
(or any similar provisions) or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply,
in each case, unless such actions are taken simultaneously with a termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a)(2) or (3) under the Exchange Act or making a statement required under
Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or
exchange offer) or from making any legally required disclosure to stockholders
with regard to a Takeover Proposal; _provided _ that any disclosure of a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) of the Exchange Act other than a "stop,
look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, a rejection of any applicable Takeover
Proposal or a reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation shall be deemed to
be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

ARTICLE V

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

SECTION 5.01. _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement;
Stockholders  Meetings_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (i)
Parent and the Company shall jointly prepare and file with the SEC the joint
proxy statement (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Joint
Proxy Statement_ ") to be sent to the stockholders of Parent relating to the
meeting of Parents stockholders (the " _Parent Stockholders  Meeting_") to
be held to consider adoption of this Agreement and the Parent Share Issuance
and to the stockholders of the Company relating to the meeting of the
Companys stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_") to be held
to consider adoption of this

 



51  Agreement and (ii) Parent shall prepare (with the Companys reasonable
cooperation) and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (as
amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Form S-4_ "), in which the
Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the
registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Common Stock to be issued
in the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing (including by responding to comments
of the SEC), and, prior to the effective date of the Form S-4, Parent shall
take all action reasonably required to be taken under any applicable state
securities Laws in connection with the Parent Share Issuance. Each of Parent
and the Company shall furnish all information as may be reasonably requested
by the other in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing
and distribution of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement. As promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 shall have become effective, each of Parent and
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement to be mailed to its respective stockholders. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing
of, or amendment or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement will made by
Parent or the Company, in each case without providing the other party a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any time prior to
the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any
of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by
the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to either the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that either such
document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of Parent and the Company. The parties shall
notify each other promptly of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective,
of the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the
Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or for
additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all
correspondence between any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Joint
Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or the Merger.

(b) Unless the Board of Directors of the Company, acting upon
the recommendation of the Special Committee, or the Special Committee has
made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company Recommendation shall
be included in the Joint Proxy Statement. The Company shall duly take all
lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting on a date as soon as reasonably practicable following
the effectiveness of the Form S-4 for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, and, subject to any Company Adverse Recommendation
Change that the Board of Directors of the Company may make, shall take all
lawful action to solicit the adoption of this Agreement by such stockholders.

 

(c) The Board of Directors of Parent shall make the Parent Recommendation and
shall include such Parent Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement.
Neither the Board

 



52  of Directors of Parent nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify or
qualify (or publicly propose to withdraw or modify or qualify) in any manner
adverse to the Company the Parent Recommendation. Parent shall duly take all
lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Parent
Stockholders Meeting on a date as soon as reasonably practicable following
the effectiveness of the Form S-4 for the purpose of obtaining the Parent
Stockholder Approval, and shall take all lawful action to solicit the adoption
of this Agreement and the approval of the Parent Share Issuance by such
stockholders.

 

SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and Contract, (i) the Company
shall, subject to Section 5.03(d), afford to Parent, and to Parents
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
Representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable prior notice during the period prior to the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement to all of the Companys and its Subsidiaries
properties, books, Contracts, commitments, personnel and records as Parent may
from time to time reasonably request in connection with the matters set forth
in Section 5.01 and 5.12 and (ii) upon request, each party shall provide the
other party with its audit work papers and the minutes and resolutions of its
Board of Directors; _provided_ that in no event shall either party be required
to provide the other party (i) minutes and resolutions of its Board of
Directors to the extent relating to the evaluation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or, in the case of the Company, any alternative
transactions, including any Takeover Proposal, or (ii) any information that
such party determines in good faith would not be appropriate to share with the
other party due to the competitively sensitive nature of such information.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall hold, and shall cause their
respective Representatives to hold, all information received from the other
party, directly or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with, and shall
otherwise abide by and be subject to, the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement dated as of February 3, 2011 between Parent and
the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). The Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement. No investigation
pursuant to this Section 5.02 or information provided or received by any
party hereto pursuant to this Agreement will affect any of the
representations or warranties of the parties hereto contained in this
Agreement.

SECTION 5.03. _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) _General Obligations_. Each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to:

 

(i) use their reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable and to
obtain or make as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the
Outside Date, all requisite authorizations, consents, orders, approvals or
filings that are or may become necessary, proper or advisable to be obtained
or made respectively by them to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

 



53 (ii) take all actions as may be requested by any Governmental Entity
to obtain such authorizations, consents, orders and approvals, and

(iii) cooperate with the reasonable requests of each other in seeking to
obtain as promptly as practicable all such authorizations, consents, orders
and approvals.

Neither Parent nor the Company shall, and each shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries, not to, take or cause to be taken any action that they are aware
or should reasonably be aware would have the effect of delaying, impairing or
impeding in any material respect the receipt or making of any such required
authorizations, consents, orders, approvals or filings.

(b) _Antitrust Obligations: Initial Filing and Second Request_.

(i) __Initial Filing__. Each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to, promptly make all filings and notifications
with all Government Entities that may be or may become necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Antitrust Laws to consummate and make effective
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent
and the Company agree to file the initial pre-merger notifications with
respect to the Merger required under the HSR Act (which filing, including
the exhibits thereto, need not be shared or otherwise disclosed to the other
party except to outside counsel of each party) no later than ten Business Days
after the date of this Agreement and to make all other filings required to be
made under any other Antitrust Law as promptly as practicable after the date
of this Agreement. Parent will not withdraw its initial filing under the HSR
Act and refile it unless it has consulted in good faith with counsel for the
Company in advance of such withdrawal and refiling. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Antitrust Law_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton
Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended,
and all other federal, state and foreign, if any, statutes, rules,
regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and other
Laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or
lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

(ii) __Request for Additional Information__. Parent and the Company each
shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, supply as promptly as
practicable any information and documentary material that may be requested by
any Governmental Entity pursuant to Antitrust Laws or any other applicable
Laws. If a request for additional information has been issued under the HSR
Act or a civil investigative demand or subpoena has been issued pursuant to
any other Antitrust Law, Parent and the Company shall supply, or cause to be
supplied, the information necessary for such party to certify substantial
compliance with the applicable Governmental Entity in connection with such a
request as promptly as practicable such that Parent and the Company,
as applicable, can, if required to do so, certify substantial compliance with
such request as soon as practicable after the issuance thereof, but in no
event later than 120 days of the issuance thereof.

 



54 (c) _Obligation to Attempt to Resolve Issues_. Without limiting the
generality of the other obligations described in this Section 5.03, each of
Parent and the Company shall take or cause to be taken the actions described
in the following clauses (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv). The obligation of each of
Parent and the Company to take or cause to be taken these actions includes an
obligation on their part to cause their respective Subsidiaries to take such
actions.

(i) In accordance with Section 5.03(b), each of Parent and the Company will,
as promptly as practicable, provide to any relevant Governmental Entity such
documents or testimony as is requested by such Governmental Entity to permit
consummation of the Merger.

(ii) If such action is necessary to prevent (A) the commencement of any
proceeding in any forum or (B) the issuance of any order, decree, decision,
determination or judgment by any Governmental Entity that, in the case of
either (A) or (B), would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise
prohibit consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Parent will, prior to such commencement or issuance and on
behalf of itself and such of its Subsidiaries as may be relevant in
this regard, proffer their willingness to take, and agree to take, such
actions (including with respect to selling, holding separate or otherwise
disposing of any business or assets, or agreeing to any conditions or
restrictions), and Parent will agree promptly to effect such actions (and
will enter into agreements with, and submit to orders of, the relevant
Governmental Entity) in each case as may be necessary to prevent such
commencement or issuance.

 

(iii) In the event of any such commencement or issuance, Parent will defend
through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court, agency or
other proceeding by any person, including any Governmental Entity, seeking to
delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(iv) Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction
or other order, decree, decision, determination or judgment, that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that any
permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination or decree is entered or issued or becomes reasonably foreseeable
to be entered or issued, in any proceeding or inquiry of any kind that would
make consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that
would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of
any of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Parent will use its best efforts to take any and all steps (including the
appeal thereof, the posting of a bond reasonably called for or the taking of
the steps contemplated by clause (ii) of this Section 5.03(c)) necessary to
resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove such
actual, anticipated or threatened injunction, decision, order,
judgment, determination or decree so as to permit such consummation as soon
as reasonably practicable.

 



55 Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, neither Parent, the Company nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be obligated to agree to any remedy not conditioned on the
consummation of the Closing.

(d) _Notice and Cooperation_. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the
sharing of information, in connection with obtaining or making all
authorizations, consents, orders, approvals or filings that are or may become
necessary, proper or advisable to be obtained or made to consummate the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, promptly
notify each other of any communication it receives from any Governmental
Entity and permit the other party to review in advance any proposed
communication by such party to any Governmental Entity and shall provide
each other with copies of all correspondence, filings or communications
between such party or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Entity or members of the staff of any Governmental Entity, on the
other hand, in each case to the extent relating to the matters that are the
subject of this Agreement. In connection with the efforts to obtain all
requisite approvals, clearances and authorizations for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law,
Parent shall take the lead in directing strategy, subject to reasonable
consultation with the Company, in connection with all matters relating to
obtaining clearances and approvals from Governmental Entities and the
expiration of waiting periods. The Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Entity relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement unless
it consults with Parent in advance and, to the extent permitted by the
relevant Governmental Entity, gives Parent the opportunity to attend and
participate at such meeting. Each of Parent and the Company may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other under this Section 5.03 as "outside counsel
only." Such competitively sensitive material and the information contained
therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and
will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or
directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance
from Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or its legal counsel.

 

SECTION 5.04. _Company and Holdings Stock Options_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company Stock Option
(including those former Holdings Stock Options), whether or not exercisable at
the Effective Time, will be assumed by Parent. Subject to, and in accordance
with, the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan and Holdings Stock Plan
and award agreement, each Company Stock Option so assumed by Parent under this
Agreement will otherwise continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms
and conditions (including with respect to vesting) set forth in the applicable
Company Stock Option and Holdings Stock Option (including any applicable plan,
award agreement or other document evidencing such Company Stock Option
or Holdings Stock Option) immediately prior to the Effective Time and be
exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
(giving effect to the conversion of Holdings Stock Options into Company Stock
Options) multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and (B) the per share exercise
price for the shares of Parent

 



56  Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Stock Option
will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock of such Company Stock Option by the Option
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The parties acknowledge
and agree that the Holdings Stock Options shall be converted into Company
Stock Options prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Holdings Merger
Agreement.

(b) Company and Parent agree that prior to the Effective Time, Company shall,
and shall be permitted under this Agreement to, take all corporate action
necessary, including, but not limited to, amending any Company Stock Option,
Holdings Stock Option, or other equity award agreement evidencing such award,
or Company Stock Plan or Holdings Stock Plan, to effectuate the provisions of
Section 5.04(a). The parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the conversion of any Company Stock Options and Holdings Stock Options
shall be effected in a manner intended to avoid the imposition of taxes under
Section 409A of the Code.

(c) The Company shall (or shall cause the applicable committee or other
appropriate party to) take all actions reasonably necessary prior to the
Effective Time to make such adjustments required to convert partnership units
authorized by the Holdings Stock Plans and covered by outstanding
Holdings Stock Options into shares of Company Common Stock, to be effective
upon the completion of the Holdings Transaction and make such adjustments in
the partnership units and shares authorized by the Holdings Stock Plans and
covered by outstanding Holdings Stock Options and to the applicable exercise
prices to reflect such conversion and the merger contemplated by the Holdings
Merger Agreement. Following the conversion of partnership units underlying the
Holdings Stock Plans and outstanding Holdings Stock Options into shares of
Company Common Stock, the Holdings Stock Options shall continue to be referred
to as Holdings Stock Options and the Holdings Stock Plans shall continue to be
referred to as Holdings Stock Plans for purposes of this Agreement.

(d) Parent shall take all action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise
of the Company Stock Options (including those former Holdings Stock Options)
following the Effective Time. On the Closing Date, Parent shall register the
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to Company Stock Options by filing an
effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or
another appropriate form, and Parent shall maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements with respect thereto for so
long as such awards remain outstanding. Parent shall take all action
reasonably required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in
connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
Company Stock Options. Following the Closing Date, the Company Stock Plans
and Holdings Stock Plans will be administered by the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors of Parent and Parent may grant equity awards under the
Company Stock Plans and Holdings Stock Plans to Company employees who
continue employment with Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their
Subsidiaries following the Closing Date, to the extent shares are available
for grant under any such plan, in accordance with the mergers
and acquisitions exemption to the equity compensation plan shareholder
approval requirement under the Nasdaq Global Select Market rules.

 



57 SECTION 5.05. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) indemnify, defend and
hold harmless, all past and present directors and officers of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any
costs, expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses and disbursements),
judgments, fines, losses, claims damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining
to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer,
employee or fiduciary of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was
serving at the request of, or to represent the interest of, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, partner, member, trustee,
fiduciary, employee or agent of any other corporation, partnership, joint
venture, limited liability company, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, including any charitable or not-for profit public service
organization or trade association whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time (including with respect to acts or omissions
occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby), and provide advancement of expenses to the
Indemnified Parties (within 10 days of receipt by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation from an Indemnified Party of a request therefor), to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law as it presently exists or may hereafter be
amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent such
amendment permits Parent or the Surviving Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights or rights of advancement of expenses than such Law
permitted Parent or the Surviving Corporation to provide prior to such
amendment), (ii) without limitation to clause (i), to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, include and cause to be maintained in effect in
the Surviving Corporations (or any successors) certificate of incorporation
and bylaws for a period of six years after the Effective Time, provisions
regarding elimination of liability of directors, and indemnification of and
advancement of expenses to directors and officers of the Company, no less
favorable than those contained in the Company Certificate or the Company
Bylaws and (iii) not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any proceeding or threatened Action (and in which
indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder), unless
such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of
such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Action or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing, and cooperates in the
defense of such proceeding or threatened Action.

(b) In the event that either Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties, rights and
other assets to any person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause
proper provision to be made so that such successor or assign shall expressly
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.05. 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time the Company shall, and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall as of the Effective Time, obtain and fully pay for,
at no expense to the beneficiaries, non-cancellable "tail" insurance policies
with a claims period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time
from insurance carriers with the same or better claims-paying ability ratings
as the Companys current insurance carriers with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance
policies (collectively, " _D andO_ __

 



58   _Insurance_ "), for the persons who are covered by the Companys existing
DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at
least as favorable to the insured individuals as the Companys existing DandO
Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby);  _provided, however_ , that the Company
shall not pay, or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall not be
required to pay, for such "tail" insurance policies a one-time premium in
excess of 250% of the Companys current annual premium for DandO Insurance. If
the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to
maintain in effect, at no expense to the beneficiaries, DandO Insurance for a
period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time for the persons
who are covered by the Companys existing DandO Insurance, with terms,
conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable as
provided in such existing DandO Insurance, from insurance carriers with the same
or better claims-paying ability ratings as the Companys current DandO
Insurance carriers; _provided, however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall
not be required to pay for such DandO Insurance an annual premium in excess of
250% of the Companys current annual premium for DandO Insurance (the "
_Premium Cap_ "), in which case the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to maintain in effect, at no expense to the beneficiaries, for a period of at
least six years from the Effective Time for the persons who are covered by the
Companys existing DandO Insurance, DandO Insurance with the best overall terms,
conditions, retentions and levels of coverage reasonably available for
an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap.

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.05 are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable from and after the Effective Time by, each
Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such person may have by Contract or otherwise.

SECTION 5.06. _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, Parent and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior
to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system. The parties agree that the initial press release to be
issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

SECTION 5.07.  _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Parent and the Company shall cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) or
acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by each person (including any person who is deemed to be a
"director by deputization" under applicable securities laws) who is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 



59 SECTION 5.08. _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Parent Common Stock (a) to be issued in the Merger
and (b) to be reserved for issuance upon exercise of Company Stock Options
(including those former Holdings Stock Options) to be approved for listing
upon the Effective Time on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, subject to
official notice of issuance.

SECTION 5.09. _Transaction Litigation_. Each party shall give the other party
the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any litigation
brought by a third party against such first party and/or its directors
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without the second partys prior written
consent.

 

SECTION 5.10. _Employee Matters_.

(a) For a period commencing on the Effective Time, and ending on the date that
is 9 months following the Closing Date, each employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, other than employees whose terms and conditions of employment
are governed by a collective bargaining agreement, the terms and conditions of
which shall be binding following the Effective Time and shall be respected by
Parent, who remains in the active employment of Parent and its Subsidiaries
(the " _Continuing Employees_ ") shall receive (i) an annual rate of salary or
wages and annual incentive opportunities that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than that provided to such employee as of the date of this
Agreement, and (ii) employee benefits, including severance, that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, to the employee benefits provided to such
employee as of the date of this Agreement.

 

(b) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent and its
Subsidiaries to continue any specific employee benefit plans or to continue
the employment of any specific person.

(c) Parent and its Subsidiaries shall recognize the service of each Continuing
Employee with the Company or its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any
predecessor employer of the Company or its Subsidiaries to the extent service
with such predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or its
Subsidiaries) as if such service had been performed with Parent with respect
to any plans or programs in which Continuing Employees are eligible
to participate after the Effective Date (i) for purposes of eligibility for
vacation, (ii) for purposes of eligibility and participation under any defined
contribution retirement plan, health or welfare plan (other than any post-
employment health or post-employment welfare plan), (iii) for purposes of
eligibility for and vesting of any company matching contributions under any
Code Section 401(k) plan, and (iv) unless covered under another arrangement
with or of the Company, for benefit accrual purposes under any severance
plan, except, in each case, to the extent such treatment would result in
duplicative benefits.

 



60 (d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent and its Subsidiaries
in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective
Time, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions and limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work
requirements and waiting periods to the extent such conditions and exclusions
were satisfied or did not apply to such employees under the welfare plans
maintained by the Company prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each
Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
prior to the Effective Time in the same plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements,
as if there had been a single continuous employer. 

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall honor
all obligations under the Company Benefit Plans and Foreign Plans and
compensation, retention and severance arrangements and agreements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time.

 

(f) Parent shall cause the Company to pay to each participant who is, as of
the Closing Date, in the Company annual bonus plans (including the Company
Annual Incentive Plan (the " _Bonus Plans_ ")), a pro-rated annual bonus in
respect of the 2011 calendar year calculated based on service and actual year-
to-date performance of the Company through the Closing Date; _provided_ that
payment of such bonuses shall remain contingent on the participants continued
employment through December 31, 2011 (except that any such participant whose
employment is terminated by the Company without "cause" or by the participant
for "good reason" (as such terms are defined in Section 5.10(f) of the Company
Disclosure Letter) after the Closing Date and on or prior to December 31, 2011
shall be entitled to receive such pro-rated bonus upon such termination of
employment (or, if necessary to avoid imposition of additional taxes under
Code Section 409A, upon such later date specified in the participants
employment agreement or the Companys severance plans for pro-rated
bonuses)). After the Closing Date, Parent shall establish in good faith
performance metrics for the remainder of the 2011 calendar year for the
Company under, and in compliance with, the Bonus Plan. All bonuses under the
Bonus Plans in respect of calendar year 2011 shall be paid by the Company no
later than March 15, 2012.

(g) The provisions of this Section 5.10 are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person, other
than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns,
any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies with respect to the matters
provided for in this Section 5.10.

 

SECTION 5.11. _Takeover Laws_. Each party and its Board of Directors shall (1)
use reasonable best efforts to ensure that no state takeover Law (including
Section 203 of the DGCL) or similar Law is or becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Voting Agreements, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreements, including the
receipt of Merger Consideration by the stockholders of the Company and (2) if
any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement,
the Voting Agreements, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreements, use reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Voting Agreements may be consummated 

 



61  as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
the Voting Agreements and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this
Agreement, the Voting Agreements, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreements.

SECTION 5.12.  _Financing_.

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including using best efforts to
(i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter and, if entered into prior to
the Closing, the definitive documentation with respect to the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter (the " _Definitive Agreements_ "), (ii)
negotiate and execute the Definitive Agreements on terms and conditions
contemplated by the Commitment Letter (including any "flex" provisions
thereof) or on such other terms and conditions that are in the aggregate, not
materially less favorable to Parent than those contained in the Commitment
Letter and do not expand upon the conditions precedent set forth in the
Commitment Letter in a manner that would reasonably be expected to make any
portion of the funding of the Financing less likely to be obtained or delay
in any material respect the funding of the Financing and, upon execution
thereof, deliver a copy thereof to the Company (which copy shall exclude
and/or redact any references to fees contained therein), (iii) satisfy on a
timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and its Subsidiaries in the
Commitment Letter and Definitive Agreements that are within its control and
comply with its obligations thereunder and not take or fail to take any action
that would be reasonably expected to prevent or impede or delay the
availability of the Financing, (iv) take each of the actions required of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in paragraphs (b)(i) through (b)(ix) below with
respect to itself and its Subsidiaries, and (v) enforce its rights under the
Commitment Letter and Definitive Agreements in the event of a breach by the
Financing Sources that impedes or delays the Closing, including by seeking
specific performance of the parties thereunder if necessary, unless Parent
reasonably concludes that seeking specific performance is impracticable or not
reasonably likely to succeed under such circumstances. In the event that all
conditions to the Financing have been satisfied, Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and the other persons
providing such Financing to fund such Financing on the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent shall have the right
from time to time to amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify, or waive
any of its rights under, the Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements,
including to add additional lenders, agents or other parties to the Commitment
Letter and/or the Definitive Agreements, and/or substitute other debt (but
not equity financing) for all or any portion of the Financing from the same
and/or alternative financing sources, including by electing to utilize its
existing senior secured credit facility as a form of alternative financing
(subject to obtaining the consent of the Required Lenders (as defined in such
credit facility) prior to the consummation of the Merger), _provided_ that any
such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver
of any provision of the Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreements that
amends the Financing and/or substitution of all or any portion of the
Financing shall not (A) expand upon the conditions precedent to the Financing
as set forth in the Commitment Letter, (B) prevent or impede or delay the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (C) provide for terms and conditions (including any "flex"
provisions) that are, in the aggregate, materially less favorable to Parent
than those in the Commitment Letter. Parent

 



62  shall be permitted to reduce the amount of Financing under the Commitment
Letter or Definitive Agreements in its reasonable discretion, _provided_ ,
that Parent shall not reduce the Financing to an amount committed below the
amount that is required, together with the financial resources of Parent,
including cash on hand and the proceeds of loans under existing revolving
credit facilities of Parent, to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the payment of
the Required Refinancing Indebtedness), and _provided further_ that such
reduction shall not (I) expand upon the conditions precedent to the Financing
as set forth in the Commitment Letter in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to make any portion of the funding of the Financing less likely to be
obtained or delay in any material respect the funding of the Financing, (II)
prevent or impede or delay the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (III) provide for other terms
and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) that are, in the aggregate,
materially less favorable to Parent than those in the Commitment Letter. If
any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable or Parent becomes aware of
any event or circumstance that makes any portion of the Financing unavailable,
in each case, on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment
Letter and such portion is reasonably required to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the payment
of the Required Refinancing Indebtedness), Parent shall use its best efforts
to arrange and obtain as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
such event alternative financing from alternative financing sources in an
amount sufficient to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the repayment of the Required
Refinancing Indebtedness), _provided_ , that without the prior written consent
of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld), no such alternative
financing (a) shall be equity financing or (b) shall be on terms and
conditions (including any "flex" provisions and conditions to funding) that
are not, in the aggregate, at least as favorable to Parent and the Company as
those in the Commitment Letter. Parent shall give the Company prompt oral and
written notice (but in any event not later than 48 hours after the occurrence)
of any material breach by any party to the Commitment Letter or Definitive
Agreements or of any condition not likely to be satisfied, in each case, of
which Parent becomes aware or any termination or waiver, amendment or other
modification of the Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreements. Parent shall
keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis and in reasonable
detail of the status of its effort to arrange the Financing and shall provide
to the Company copies of all documents related to the Financing (excluding fee
letters and engagement letters, except to the extent that such documents
contain any conditions to funding or "flex" provisions (excluding provisions
related solely to fees)). In the event that Parent commences an enforcement
action to enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter or the Definitive
Agreements and/or cause the Financing Sources to fund the Financing (any such
action, a " _Financing Action_ "), Parent shall (x) keep the Company
reasonably informed of the status of the Financing Action and (y) at the
reasonable request of the Company, shall make Parents employees and
Representatives (other than any of its Financing Sources) reasonably available
to discuss the status of, and material developments with respect to, the
Financing Action.

 

(b) The Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its and their
respective Representatives, including legal, tax, regulatory and accounting,
to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent and/or the
Financing Sources in connection with the Financing ( _provided_ that
such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the

 



63  Company and its Subsidiaries), including, but not limited to, (i) promptly
providing information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Financing Sources to the extent reasonably requested by Parent to assist in
preparation of customary offering or information documents to be used for the
completion of the Financing as contemplated by the Commitment Letter, (ii)
participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-
one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers for the Financing and
senior management and Representatives, with appropriate seniority and
expertise, of the Company), presentations, road shows, drafting sessions, due
diligence sessions (including accounting due diligence sessions) and sessions
with the rating agencies, (iii) assisting in the preparation of documents and
materials, including, but not limited to, (A) any customary
offering documents, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar
documents (including historical and pro forma financial statements and
information) for any of the Financing, and (B) materials for rating agency
presentations, (iv) cooperating with the marketing efforts for any of the
Financing (including consenting to the use of the Companys and its
Subsidiaries logos; _provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner
that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company
or its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), (v) executing and delivering (or using reasonable best efforts
to obtain from its advisors), and causing its Subsidiaries to execute and
deliver (or use reasonable best efforts to obtain from its advisors),
customary certificates (including a certificate of the principal financial
officer of the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to solvency matters),
accounting comfort letters (including consents of accountants for use of their
reports in any materials relating to the Financing), legal opinions or other
documents and instruments relating to guarantees and other matters ancillary
to the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent as necessary and
customary in connection with the Financing, (vi) assisting in (A) the
preparation of and entering into one or more credit agreements, currency or
interest hedging agreements or (B) the amendment of any of the Companys or
its Subsidiaries existing credit agreements, currency or interest hedging
agreements, in each case, on terms satisfactory to Parent and that are
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Financing; _provided_
that no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any such
agreements or amendments shall be effective until the Effective Time, (vii) as
promptly as practicable, furnishing Parent and the Financing Sources with all
financial and other information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as
may be reasonably requested by Parent and/or the Financing Sources to assist
in preparation of customary offering or information documents to be used for
the completion of the Financing as contemplated by the Commitment Letter,
(viii) using its reasonable best efforts, as appropriate, to have its
independent accountants provide their reasonable cooperation and assistance
and (ix) cooperating reasonably with Parents Financing Sources due
diligence, to the extent customary and not unreasonably interfering with the
business of the Company; _provided_ that, until the Effective Time occurs,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall (1) be required to pay
any commitment or other similar fee, (2) have any liability or any obligation
under any credit agreement or any related document or any other agreement
or document related to the Financing (or alternative financing that Parent
may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
(3) be required to incur any other liability in connection with the Financing
(or any alternative financing that Parent may raise in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or (4) be required to issue a
notice of optional redemption for any outstanding series of notes of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries if the indenture governing such series of
notes does not provide that such notice may be conditioned on

 



64  the occurrence of the Effective Time unless, in the case of clauses (1), (2)
and (3), reimbursed or indemnified by Parent to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Company; _provided_ ,  _further,_ that (I) all non-public or other
confidential information provided by the Company or any of its Representatives
pursuant to this Section 5.12 shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent shall be permitted to
disclose such information to potential syndicate members during syndication,
subject to customary confidentiality undertakings by such potential syndicate
members and (II) the Company shall be permitted a reasonable period to
comment on any documents or other information circulated to potential
financing sources that contain or are based upon any such non-public or other
confidential information. Parent (A) shall promptly, upon request by
the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out of pocket costs
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with the
cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their Representatives
contemplated by this Section 5.12, (B) acknowledges and agrees that the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall not have
any responsibility for, or incur any liability to any person prior to the
Effective Time under, the Financing or any alternative financing that Parent
may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (C) shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and

party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party
to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or

partial exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its rights under
this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any
other rights under this Agreement.

requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled

the transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 8.10. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial

other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by,
among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 8.10.

SECTION 8.11.  _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

SECTION 8.12. _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified
as parties hereto and no former, current or future equity holders,
controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates of
any party hereto or any

 



82  former, current or future stockholder, controlling person, director,
officer, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, agent or

Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on,
in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith. Without limiting the rights of any party against the other parties
