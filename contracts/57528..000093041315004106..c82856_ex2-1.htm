The Parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as

Article 1

  



  

Description of Transaction

  



  

Section 1.1 _The Mergers_.

  



  

(a) _Merger of Merger Sub into the Company_. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined
in _Section 1.3_ ), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. By
virtue of the First Merger, at the Effective Time, the separate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation in the First Merger (the " _First Step Surviving Corporation_ ").

  



  

(b) _Merger of the First Step Surviving Corporation into Merger Sub II_. Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
Second Effective Time (as defined in _Section 1.3_ ), the First Step Surviving
Corporation shall be merged with and into Merger Sub II. By virtue of the
Second Merger, at the Second Effective Time, the separate existence of the
First Step Surviving Corporation shall cease and Merger Sub II shall continue
as the surviving limited liability company in the Second Merger (the " _Final
Surviving Company_ ") (it being understood that references to "Merger Sub II"
shall be deemed to be references to the "Final Surviving Company" to the
extent such references relate to the period after the Second Effective Time).

  



  

Section 1.2 _Effects of the Mergers_. Each of the First Merger and Second
Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the
applicable provisions of the DGCL and the DLLCA.

  



  

Section 1.3 _Closing; Effective Time_. The consummation of the First Merger
(the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Fenwick and West LLP,

--- 

    

no later than the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the
last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in _Article 5_
(other than the conditions set forth in _Section 5.2(d)_ and _Section 5.3(d)_
, which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions). The date on which the
Closing actually takes place is referred to as the " _Closing Date_." Subject
to the provisions of this Agreement, a certificate of merger that the Parties
shall agree satisfies the applicable requirements of the DGCL (the " _First
Certificate of Merger_ ") shall be duly executed by the Company and
concurrently with or as soon as practicable following the Closing shall be
filed with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The
First Merger shall become effective at the time of the filing of the First
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or
at such later time as may be agreed by Parent and the Company and specified
in the First Certificate of Merger (the time as of which the First Merger
becomes effective being referred to as the " _Effective Time_ "). Promptly
following the Effective Time, but in no event later than two Business Days
thereafter, a certificate of merger that the Parties shall agree satisfies the
applicable requirements of the DGCL and the DLLCA (the " _Second Certificate
of Merger_ ") shall be duly executed by Merger Sub II and filed with the
Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Second Merger
shall become effective at the time of the filing of the Second Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Second
Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.5 _Conversion of Company Common Stock; Restricted Stock, Options
and RSUs_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any
further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any
equityholder of the Company:

  



  

(i) _Treasury Shares_. All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by
the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion or payment of any
property or consideration, and shall cease to exist;

  



  

(ii) _Company Common Stock Held by Parent, Merger Subs or any Subsidiaries of
Parent_. Any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Subs or
any other Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion or payment of any
property or consideration, and shall cease to exist;

  



  

(iii) _Company Common Stock_. Except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)"
above and subject to _Section 1.5(b)_ and  _Section 1.5(c)_ , each share of
Company Common Stock, excluding Company Restricted Stock, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall
be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive (A) an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to $12.50 (the " _Per Share Cash
Consideration_ ") and (B) 0.775 of a share of Parent Common Stock (the " _Per
Share Stock Consideration_ " and together with the Per Share
Cash Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Shares of Company
Restricted Stock shall be cancelled and automatically converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration; _provided, however_ , that such
Merger Consideration shall be unvested and subject to the same repurchase
option, risk of forfeiture or other condition that the Company Restricted
Stock was subject to immediately prior to the Effective Time, taking into
account the transactions that are the subject of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each share of Company Restricted
Stock held by a non-employee director of the Company that is outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(iv) _Company Options_. Each Company Option (whether vested or unvested)
shall be assumed by Parent and shall become an option to acquire Parent
Common Stock, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the
applicable Company Equity Plan and Company Option agreement in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, taking into account the transactions
that are the subject of this Agreement, as follows:

  



  

(1) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Company
Option assumed by Parent shall be determined by multiplying the number
of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding
the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock; and

   

4 
--- 

  

--- 

    

(2) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of each Company Option assumed by Parent shall be determined by
dividing the per share exercise price of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the
Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest
whole cent.

  



  

Any restriction on the exercise of any Company Option assumed by Parent shall
continue in full force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting
schedule and other provisions of such Company Option shall otherwise remain
unchanged as a result of the assumption of such Company Option, in each case
except to the extent otherwise provided in any Company Equity Plan, the
Company Change in Control Plan, or any stock option or other agreement
between the holder of a Company Option and the Company and taking into account
the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement. Within five Business
Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to any holder of a
Company Option an appropriate notice setting forth such former participants'
rights with respect to the Company Options assumed by Parent, as provided in
this _Section 1.5(a)(iv)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Company Option
held by a non-employee director of the Company that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not be assumed by Parent and
shall instead be cancelled in exchange for a payment by Parent of (x) an
amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option multiplied by (2) the
excess, if any, of the Per Share Cash Consideration over the product of (I)
the applicable per share exercise price under such Company Option multiplied
by (II) the Cash Consideration Percentage, and (y) a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of (1) the product of (I) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option multiplied by (II) the excess, if any, of the Per Share
Stock Consideration Value over the product of (A) the applicable per share
exercise price under such Company Option multiplied by (B) the Stock
Consideration Percentage divided by (2) the Parent Stock Transaction Value.

  



  

(v) _Company RSUs_. Each Company RSU that is unexpired, unsettled and
outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent and shall
become a RSU to receive, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under the applicable Company Equity Plan and Company RSU agreement in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject
to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock. Any restriction on the
settlement of any Company RSU assumed by Parent shall continue in full force
and effect and the term, settlement terms, vesting schedule and other
provisions of such Company RSU shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of
the assumption and conversion of such Company RSU, in each case except to the
extent otherwise provided in any Company Equity Plan, the Company Change in
Control Plan, or any RSU or other agreement between the holder of a Company
RSU and the Company and taking into account the transactions that are the
subject of this Agreement. Within five Business Days following the Effective
Time, Parent shall deliver to any holder of a Company RSU an appropriate
notice setting forth such former participants' rights with respect to the
Company RSUs assumed by Parent, as provided in this _Section 1.5(a)(v)_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Company RSU held by a non-
employee director of the Company that is outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall not be assumed by Parent and shall instead be

   

5 
--- 

  

--- 

    

cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock that is subject to the
Company RSU.

  



  

(vi) _Company Performance RSUs_. (A) Each 2015 Company Performance RSU that
is unexpired, unsettled and outstanding as of the Effective Time shall
be assumed by Parent and shall become a RSU to receive, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under the applicable Company Equity Plan and
2015 Company Performance RSU agreement in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (1) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to the Target Number of Award
Units as set forth in each Notice of Grant of Award and Award Agreement
pursuant to which Company Performance RSUs were granted multiplied by (2) the
Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock;  _provided, however_ , that any
performance metric, terms or conditions that applied to such Company
Performance RSU shall be deemed satisfied as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and such Company Performance RSU shall vest and become
payable by Parent on the date upon which the applicable Company Common Stock
subject to the Company Performance RSUs would have vested under the time-
based vesting terms set forth in the Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit
Award Agreement governing such Company Performance RSU, it being understood
that pursuant to this provision, a portion of such Company Performance RSUs
would be deemed immediately vested upon the Effective Time correlating to the
portion of the Measurement Period (as defined in the Company Performance RSU)
completed as of the Effective Time. Except as set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence, any restriction on the settlement of any 2015 Company
Performance RSU assumed by Parent shall continue in full force and effect and
the term, settlement terms, vesting schedule and other provisions of such
2015 Company Performance RSU shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of
the assumption and conversion of such Company Performance RSU, in each case
except to the extent otherwise provided in any Company Equity Plan, the
Company Change in Control Plan, or any Performance RSU or other agreement
between the holder of a Company Performance RSU and the Company and taking
into account the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement. Within
five Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to any
holder of a 2015 Company Performance RSUs an appropriate notice setting forth
such former participants' rights with respect to the 2015 Company Performance
RSUs assumed by Parent, as provided in this _Section 1.5(a)(vi)_.

  



  

(B) Each 2014 Company Performance RSU that is unexpired, unsettled and
outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be, by virtue of the occurrence
of the Effective Time and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company, the holder of such 2014 Company Performance RSU or any
other Person, cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive
the product of (1) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (2) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock equal to the Target Number of Award Units as
set forth in each Notice of Grant of Award and Award Agreement pursuant to
which Company Performance RSUs were granted.

(b) If, during the period from the Agreement Date through the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are
changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock
split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock
split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other
similar transaction, or if a stock dividend is declared by the Company or
Parent during such period, or a record date with respect to any such event
shall occur during such period, then the components of the Merger
Consideration, the Exchange Ratio and the other terms hereof shall be
adjusted to the extent appropriate to provide the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

  



  

(c) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or options, RSUs or other
equity awards for a fractional share of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued in connection with the First Merger, and no certificates, scrips or
equity awards for any such fractional shares shall be issued. Any holder of
Company Common Stock or Company Restricted Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to receive, or entitled to a right to receive, a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable to such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a
share and upon surrender of such holder's Company Common Stock or
Company Restricted Stock be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the
nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by multiplying such
fraction by the Parent Stock Consideration Value.

  



  

Section 1.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly
demanded appraisal for such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance
with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such
Company Common Stock, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and shall
instead represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section
262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives,
withdraws or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or
other applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value
of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be
exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law
in accordance with _Section 1.8(g)_. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of
Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall
have the opportunity to direct all negotiations and Proceedings with respect
to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, (unless required by Law) the
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any
payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or
compromise, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any portion
of the aggregate Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent
(as defined in _Section 1.8_ ) to pay for Company Common Stock that have
become Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

Section 1.7 _Closing of the Company 's Transfer Books_. At the Effective
Time: (a) all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist in exchange for the consideration issued pursuant to _Section 1.5_ ,
and all holders of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as Company
Stockholders except as provided for in _Section 1.5_ ; and (b) the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No
further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on
such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, a valid certificate previously representing any shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "
_Company Stock Certificate_ ") is presented to the Exchange Agent (as defined
in _Section 1.8_ ) or to the First Step Surviving Corporation, Final Surviving
Company or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall
be exchanged as provided in _Section 1.8_.

  



  

Section 1.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall cause Computershare Trust
Company, N.A. (" _Computershare_ ") (or, if Computershare is not serving in
this role, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company) to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "). As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (and
no later than one Business Day after the Effective Time), Parent shall make
available or deposit with the Exchange Agent: (i) shares of non-certificated
Parent Common Stock represented by book-entry shares or certificates
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section
1.5_ ; and (ii) cash sufficient to make all payments pursuant to
_Section 1.5_. The shares of Parent Common Stock and cash amounts so
deposited with the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or
distributions received by the Exchange Agent with respect to such shares of
Parent Common Stock, are referred to collectively as the " _Exchange Fund_."

  



  

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the First Step
Surviving Corporation, Final Surviving Company or Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Company Stock
Certificate or shares of non-certificated Company Common Stock represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each case, which shares of Company
Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement:

  



  

(i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Stock Certificates or transfer
of the Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, to the Exchange Agent, and
shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent, the
Company and the Exchange Agent shall reasonably agree; and

  



  

(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Stock
Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration.

   

8 
--- 

  

--- 

    

(c) Upon the surrender of Company Stock Certificates or transfer of Book-
Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, and upon delivery of
a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form in accordance with
the instructions thereto, with respect to such Company Stock Certificates or
an agent's message in the case of a book entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares,
the holder of such Company Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Company Stock Certificates and for
each Book-Entry Share and any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 1.5(c)_ and any cash in respect to any dividend or distribution
pursuant to _Section 1.8(e)_. Any Company Stock Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
any surrendered Company Stock Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition precedent of payment that the Company Stock Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Company Stock Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the
satisfaction of the First Step Surviving Corporation or Final Surviving
Company that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid.
Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall
only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Company Stock
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(d) If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person
of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company
Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of
the Exchange Fund and subject to _Section 1.8(h)_ , Parent) shall deliver, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, the
Merger Consideration as set forth in _Section 1.5_ and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to _Section 1.5(c) _ and any cash in respect of
any dividend or distribution that the holder has the right to receive pursuant
to _Section 1.8(e)_.

  



  

(e) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
or otherwise delivered to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Common Stock
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the
right to receive in the Merger until such holder surrenders such Company
Common Stock in accordance with this _Section 1.8_. Subject to applicable Law
(including applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws),
following surrender of any such Company Common Stock, the Exchange Agent
shall deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest, (i) a
certificate(s) representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor along with payment in cash pursuant to _Section 1.5_ and
the amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the

   

9 
--- 

  

--- 

    

Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Company Common Stock as of the one year anniversary of the Closing Date shall
be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock
who have not theretofore surrendered their shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with this _Section 1.8_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for
satisfaction of their claims for Parent Common Stock, cash and any dividends
or distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

(g) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the First Step Surviving Corporation
and the Final Surviving Company and their designees shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Common
Stock, Company Restricted Stock, Company Options, Company RSUs and Company
Performance RSUs such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
from such consideration under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law or under any other applicable Law. To the extent such amounts
are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid.

  



  

(h) Neither Parent nor the Final Surviving Company shall be liable to any
holder or former holder of Company Common Stock, Company Restricted
Stock, Company Options, Company RSUs and Company Performance RSUs or to any
other Person with respect to any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends
or distributions with respect thereto), or for any cash amounts, properly
delivered to any public official as required by any applicable abandoned
property Law, escheat Law or similar Law.

  



  

Section 1.9 _Tax Consequences_. For federal income tax purposes, the Merger
is intended to constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368 of the Code. The Parties to this Agreement adopt this Agreement as a "plan
of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a)
of the United States Treasury Regulations.

  



  

Section 1.10 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent or the Final Surviving Company to be
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest
the Final Surviving Company with full right, title and possession of and to
all rights and property of Merger Subs and the Company, the officers,
directors and board of managers of the Final Surviving Company and Parent
shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Subs, in the name of the
Company and otherwise) to take such action.

the executed commitment letter, dated as of the Agreement Date, by and
among Parent and lenders party thereto (the " _Lenders_ "), including all
exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto (the " _Financing
Commitments_ ") and the related fee letters (the " _Fee Letters_ ")
with respect to fees and related arrangements with respect to the Financing
(provided, however, that the provisions in the Financing Commitments relating
to fee amounts and pricing caps (none of which could adversely affect the
amount or availability or conditionality of the Financing), including the
provisions relating to fee amounts and pricing caps set forth in any

   

37 
--- 

  

--- 

    

market flex provisions, may be redacted), pursuant to which, and subject to
the terms and conditions of which, the Lenders have committed to lend
the amounts set forth therein to Parent for the purpose of funding the
Transactions (such committed financing, together with, unless the context
otherwise requires, any debt securities issued in lieu thereof, the "
_Financing_ ").

  



  

(b) As of the Agreement Date, (i) the Financing Commitments are in full force
and effect (subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other
similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, and
general equitable principles), and have not been withdrawn, rescinded or
terminated, or otherwise amended or modified in any respect, and (ii) each of
the Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered, constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the
other parties thereto, enforceable against it or them, as the case may be, in
accordance with its terms except as enforceability may be affected by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, and
general equitable principles. Except for the Fee Letters, the Financing
Commitments are the only agreements relating to the Financing as of the
Agreement Date. Other than as expressly set forth in such Financing
Commitments and the Fee Letters, there are no other agreements, side letters,
or arrangements relating to the Financing Commitments that could affect the
amount, availability or conditionality of the Financing.

  



  

(c) As of the Agreement Date, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on
the part of Parent under any term or condition of the Financing Commitments
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, would (i) make any of the assumptions or any
of the statements set forth in the Financing Commitments inaccurate in any
material respect, (ii) result in any of the conditions in the Financing
Commitments not being satisfied or (iii) otherwise result in the Financing not

Merger Consideration and all associated fees, costs and expenses in
connection with the Transactions, including the Financing, and to repay,
retire and redeem in full all Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries
set forth in items 1, 2 and 4 of Section 2.11(a)(vii) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Required Amount_ "). The Financing
Commitments contain all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the
parties thereunder to make the Financing available to Parent on the terms and
subject only to the conditions set forth therein. Parent acknowledges that its
obligation to consummate the Merger is not contingent on Parent's ability to
obtain any financing whether pursuant to the Financing Commitments or
otherwise, and Parent's failure to consummate the Financing or alternative
financing for the Required Amount upon the satisfaction or waiver of the
closing conditions set forth in _Section 5.1_ and _Section 5.2_ of this
Agreement shall constitute an Intentional Breach by Parent of this Agreement.

material risk of any Governmental Authority entering an Order prohibiting
the consummation of the Merger or materially increasing the risk of not being
able to remove any such Order on appeal or otherwise;

to obtain all regulatory approvals needed to ensure that the Parent Common

Recommendation in and of itself.

  



  

(iii) Notwithstanding any Change of Company Board Recommendation, the Company
shall nonetheless submit this Agreement to the Company Stockholders
for adoption at the Company Stockholders Meeting unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Article 6_ prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this
Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and
matters required by Law to be voted on by the Company Stockholders in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by
the Company Stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting.

declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to provide that all proxies solicited in connection with
the Parent Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with all
applicable Laws. In the event that during the five Business Days prior to the
date that the Parent Stockholders Meeting is then scheduled to be held, Parent
delivers a notice of an intent to make a Change of Parent Board

not enforce, any standstill agreement to the extent such provision would
otherwise prohibit the counterparty thereto from making an unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board).

  



  

The Company shall immediately (A) cease and cause to be terminated any

any time following the Agreement Date and prior to the Company
Stockholder Approval, in response to a _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith After Consultation

participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person (or such Person's
representatives) that has made such Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) furnish to
the Person (or such Person's representatives) that has made the Acquisition

Acquisition Proposal as a result of a breach of the terms of this _Section
4.6_ , (B) prior to engaging or participating in any such discussions or
negotiations with or furnishing any information to, such Person, the Company
gives Parent written notice of the identity of such Person and its

reflecting conditions or other material terms relating to any Acquisition
Proposal is furnished to Parent) and (y) the identity of the Person or "group"
(as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) making any such

material contains any financial terms, conditions or other material
terms relating to any Acquisition Proposal, including the financing thereof)
exchanged between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the
Company Representatives, on the one hand, and the Person making an Acquisition
Proposal or any of its Affiliates, or their respective officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or
representatives, on the other hand.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the
Company receives an Acquisition Proposal, other than as a result of a
material breach of this _Section 4.6_ , that the Company Board concludes in
good faith, After Consultation, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company
Board may, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, if it determines in good faith, After Consultation, that the
failure to take such actions contemplated by clauses (x) and/or (y) below
would be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders under applicable Law, (x) effect a Change of
Company Board Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal and/or
(y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.1(g) _ and simultaneously
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;
_provided, however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless in advance of or concurrently
with such termination the Company pays the Termination Fee; and _provided
further_ that the Company Board may not effect a Change of Company Board
Recommendation pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless:

  



  

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four Business Days in advance (the " _Superior Proposal Notice Period_ "), of
its intention to effect such a Change of Company Board Recommendation (which
notice itself shall not constitute a Change of Company Board Recommendation)
or terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Company Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify
the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity
of the Person or group making such Superior Proposal, and shall have
contemporaneously provided (in the case of a proposed termination pursuant to
clause (y) above) the execution draft of the relevant proposed definitive
transaction agreements with the Person making such Superior Proposal (the "
_Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement_ ")) and other material documents
with respect to such Superior Proposal (including any with respect to the
financing thereof); and

  



  

(ii) prior to effecting such Change of Company Board Recommendation or
terminating this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Company Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, (A) if requested by Parent,
the Company shall have, and shall have caused the Company Representatives to,
during the Superior Proposal Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good
faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal,
and (B) Parent shall not have, during the Superior Proposal Notice Period,
made an irrevocable written offer during the Superior Proposal Notice Period
that would, upon the Company's acceptance thereof, be binding on Parent and
that, after consideration of such offer by the Company Board in good faith
and After Consultation, results in the Company Board determining that such
Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal.

   

52 
--- 

  

--- 

    

In the event of any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a
new written notice to Parent pursuant to _Section 4.6(d)(i)_ and to comply
with the requirements of this _Section 4.6(d)_ with respect to such new
written notice (including a new Superior Proposal Notice Period), except the
Superior Proposal Notice Period shall be at least two Business Days (rather
than the four Business Days contemplated by _Section 4.6(d)(i)_ above).

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and
solely in response to an Intervening Event, the Company Board may effect a
Change of Company Board Recommendation prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval if the Company Board determines in good faith, After
Consultation, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Company
Board's fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law;
_provided, however_ , that the Company Board may not effect such a Change of
Company Board Recommendation unless:

  



  

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four Business Days in advance (the " _Company Intervening Event Notice
Period_ "), of its intention to effect such a Change of Company Board
Recommendation (which notice itself shall not constitute a Change of Company
Board Recommendation), which notice shall specify the details of such
Intervening Event and the basis upon which the Company Board intends to
effect a Change of Company Board Recommendation; and

  



  

(ii) prior to effecting such Change of Company Board Recommendation, (A) if
requested by Parent, the Company shall have, and shall have caused the
Company Representatives to, during the Company Intervening Event Notice
Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that a Change of Company Board
Recommendation is no longer necessary, and (B) that Parent shall not have,
during the Company Intervening Event Notice Period, made an irrevocable
written offer during the Company Intervening Event Notice Period that would,
upon the Company's acceptance thereof, be binding on Parent and that,
after due consideration of such offer by the Company Board in good faith and
After Consultation, results in the Company Board determining that it would
not be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties to the Company
Stockholders under applicable Law to not effect the Change of Company Board
Recommendation.

  



  

In the event of any material changes to the circumstances applicable to the
Intervening Event, after the start of the Company Intervening Event Notice
Period, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to
Parent pursuant to _Section 4.6(e)(i)_ and to comply with the requirements of
this _Section 4.6(e)_ with respect to such new written notice (including a new
Company Intervening Event Notice Period) except the Company Intervening Event
Notice Period shall be at least two Business Days (rather than the four
Business Days contemplated by _Section 4.6(e)(i)_ above).

similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act, (ii) an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition
Proposal, and/or (iii) an express reaffirmation of the Company

such provision would otherwise prohibit the counterparty thereto from making
an unsolicited Parent Acquisition Proposal to the Parent Board).

  



  

Parent shall immediately (A) cease and cause to be terminated any

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time following the Agreement Date and prior to the Parent
Stockholder Approval, in response to a _bona fide_ written Parent Acquisition
Proposal that the Parent Board determines in good faith, After Consultation,
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a Parent
Superior Proposal, Parent and the Parent Representatives may (i) engage or
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person (or such
Person's representatives) that has made such Parent Acquisition Proposal, and
(ii) furnish to the Person (or such Person's representatives) that has made
the Parent Acquisition Proposal information relating to Parent and its
Subsidiaries and/or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books,
records or the personnel of Parent and its Subsidiaries, in each case pursuant
to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that (A) the Parent
Acquisition Proposal was unsolicited and Parent did not receive such Parent
Acquisition Proposal as a result of a breach of the terms of this _Section
4.7_ , (B) prior to engaging or participating in any such discussions or
negotiations with or furnishing any information to, such Person, Parent gives
the Company written notice of the identity of such Person and its
representatives and all of the material terms and conditions of such Parent
Acquisition Proposal and of Parent's intention to engage or participate in
discussions or negotiations with, or furnish information to such Person and
(C) contemporaneously with or promptly (but in no event later than one

(c) In addition to the obligations of Parent set forth in _Section 4.7(b)_ ,
Parent shall promptly, and in all cases within one Business Day after the
receipt by Parent, notify the Company orally and in writing of the receipt by
Parent or the Parent Representatives of any Parent Acquisition Proposal or
Parent Acquisition Inquiry, which notice shall include (x) the material terms
and conditions of such Parent Acquisition Proposal or Parent Acquisition
Inquiry

   

55 
--- 

  

--- 

    

(for the purposes of clarity, this clause (x) shall be deemed satisfied in
the event a copy of any written Parent Acquisition Proposal and any
related agreements, reflecting conditions or other material terms relating to
any Parent Acquisition Proposal is furnished to the Company) and (y) the
identity of the Person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act) making any such Parent Acquisition Proposal or Parent
Acquisition Inquiry. Commencing upon the provision of any notice referred to
above until any such Parent Acquisition Proposal or Parent Acquisition
Inquiry has been withdrawn, Parent (or its outside counsel) shall (A) provide
prompt notice to the Company no later than one Business Day after any material
change in the material terms of any such Parent Acquisition Proposal or
Parent Acquisition Inquiry and (B) promptly (and in any event not later than
one Business Day) after receipt or delivery thereof, provide the Company (or
its outside counsel) with copies of all material documents (including any
written, or electronic material to the extent such material contains any
financial terms, conditions or other material terms relating to any Parent
Acquisition Proposal, including the financing thereof) exchanged between
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Parent Representatives, on
the one hand, and the Person making a Parent Acquisition Proposal or any of
its Affiliates, or their respective officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or
representatives, on the other hand.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Parent
receives a Parent Acquisition Proposal, other than as a result of a
material breach of this _Section 4.7_ , that the Parent Board concludes in
good faith, After Consultation, constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal, the
Parent Board may, at any time prior to the receipt of the Parent Stockholder
Approval, if it determines in good faith, After Consultation, that the
failure to take such actions contemplated by clauses (x) and/or (y) below
would be inconsistent with the Parent Board's fiduciary duties to the Parent
Stockholders under applicable Law, (x) effect a Change of Parent Board
Recommendation with respect to such Parent Superior Proposal and/or (y)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.1(h)_ and simultaneously
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Parent Superior
Proposal; _provided, however_ , that Parent shall not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless in advance of or
concurrently with such termination Parent pays the Parent Termination Fee;
and _provided further_ that the Parent Board may not effect a Change of
Parent Board Recommendation pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless:

  



  

(i) Parent shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least four
Business Days in advance (the " _Parent Superior Proposal Notice Period_ "),
of its intention to effect such a Change of Parent Board Recommendation (which
notice itself shall not constitute a Change of Parent Board Recommendation)
or terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Parent Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Parent Superior Proposal, which notice shall
specify the material terms and conditions of such Parent Superior Proposal
and the identity of the Person or group making such Parent Superior Proposal,
and shall have contemporaneously provided (in the case of a proposed
termination pursuant to clause (y) above) the execution draft of the relevant
proposed definitive transaction agreements with the Person making such Parent
Superior Proposal (the " _Alternative Parent Acquisition Agreement_ ")) and
other material documents with respect to such Parent Superior Proposal
(including any with respect to the financing thereof); and

   

56 
--- 

  

--- 

    

(ii) prior to effecting such Change of Parent Board Recommendation or
terminating this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Parent Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Parent Superior Proposal, (A) if requested by
the Company, Parent shall have, and shall have caused the
Parent Representatives to, during the Parent Superior Proposal Notice Period,
negotiate with the Company in good faith to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Parent Acquisition
Proposal ceases to constitute a Parent Superior Proposal, and (B) the Company
shall not have, during the Parent Superior Proposal Notice Period, made an
irrevocable written offer during the Parent Superior Proposal Notice Period
that would, upon Parent's acceptance thereof, be binding on Parent and that,
after consideration of such offer by the Parent Board in good faith and After
Consultation, results in the Parent Board determining that such Parent
Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal.

  



  

In the event of any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
revisions to the Parent Superior Proposal, Parent shall be required to deliver
a new written notice to the Company pursuant to _Section 4.7(d)(i)_ and to
comply with the requirements of this _Section 4.7_ with respect to such new
written notice (including a new Parent Superior Proposal Notice Period),
except the Parent Superior Proposal Notice Period shall be at least two
Business Days (rather than the four Business Days contemplated by _Section
4.7(d)(i)_ above).

  



  

(e) Parent shall keep confidential any proposals made by the Company to
revise the terms of this Agreement, other than in the event of any
amendment to this Agreement and to the extent required by applicable Law to
be disclosed in any Parent SEC Documents.

  



  

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent Board from
taking and disclosing to the Parent Stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9, Item 1012 of Regulation M-A or otherwise
complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012 under the Exchange
Act; _provided, however_ , that none of the following shall be deemed to be a
Change of Parent Board Recommendation: (i) a "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act, (ii) an express rejection of any applicable Parent Acquisition
Proposal, and/or (iii) an express reaffirmation of the Parent Board
Recommendation.

for the consummation of the Transactions or required by the terms of any
Contract of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the
execution, performance or consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ that,
the Company and Parent shall determine reasonably and jointly whether to seek
any Consents from third parties under any Company Material Contract. In the
event that such third party Consent described in this _Section 4.8(a)_ shall
not be obtained, the Company and Parent shall determine reasonably and jointly
whether to take any further actions with respect to such Contracts;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that without its consent (such consent
to be given or withheld in its sole discretion), the Company shall not be
required to pay any amount or change its business

Agreement, the Company and Parent agree, and Parent and the Company agree to
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to
consummate and make effective the Transactions and to use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions to each Party's obligation to

as practicable, including taking all actions necessary (i) to obtain all
Governmental Consents required for the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in _Section 5.1(c)_ , (ii) to effect all such necessary registrations

judicial or administrative, brought under, pursuant to or relating to any
regulatory Law challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions. The Parties shall cooperate fully with each other to the extent
necessary in connection with the foregoing.

  



  

(c) In connection with the efforts referenced in _Section 4.8(b)_ and without
limiting the generality of the undertaking pursuant thereto, Parent and
Company shall promptly make all filings which may be required for the
satisfaction of the condition set forth in _Section 5.1(c)_ by each of them
in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, which, in any event,
shall be made within ten Business Days following the Agreement Date with
respect to the initial filings required under the HSR Act and all other
applicable Antitrust Laws. In addition, Parent and the Company agree, and
shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use
their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any Governmental Consents
required for the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 5.1(c)_
as contemplated by _Section 4.8(b)_ above as promptly as possible, including,
within ten Business Days of the Agreement Date, to make all other necessary
filings, notifications or registrations to obtain all such
Governmental Consents and to respond as promptly as practicable to any

Parent be required to (i) sell or otherwise dispose of, hold separate or agree
to sell or dispose of, any assets, categories of assets or businesses of
Parent or its Subsidiaries, (ii) amend, modify or terminate existing
relationships, contractual rights or obligations or (iii) amend, modify or
terminate existing licenses or other intellectual property agreements or enter
into new licenses or other intellectual property agreements to avoid, prevent
or terminate any action by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or the U.S.
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority which would
restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent consummation of the Transactions. Each
Party shall furnish to the other such necessary information and assistance as
the other Party may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of
any necessary filings or submissions by it to any Governmental Authority.
Neither Party shall Consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory
deadline or withdraw its notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act
or any other filing made pursuant to any Antitrust Law or other regulatory Law
unless the other Party has given its prior written Consent to such extension
or delay.

(d) Parent and the Company will consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and
provide to the other in advance (to the extent legally permissible), any
analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals
made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party hereto in connection with
Proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Laws. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, in connection with this Agreement and the

notice of all meetings with any Governmental Authority relating to any
Antitrust Laws, (ii) give each other an opportunity to participate in each of
such meetings, (iii) give each other reasonable advance notice of all

substantive communications from any Governmental Authority relating to any
Antitrust Laws. Any disclosures or provision of copies by one Party to the
other may be made on an outside counsel basis, if appropriate.

  



  

(e) Each of Parent and the Company shall notify and keep the other advised as
to (i) any material communication from any Governmental Authority
regarding any of the Transactions, and (ii) any litigation or administrative
Proceeding pending and known to such Party, or to its Knowledge threatened,
which challenges, or would challenge, the Transactions. The Company and Parent
shall not take any action inconsistent with their obligations under this
Agreement or, without prejudice to the Company's or Parent's rights under this
Agreement, which would materially hinder or delay the consummation of the
Transaction

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent shall have the principal responsibility for devising and
implementing the strategy for obtaining any necessary Antitrust Laws or
competition clearances and shall take the lead in all meetings
and communications with any Governmental Authority in connection with
obtaining any necessary Antitrust Laws or competition clearances. All
expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing shall be shared equally by
Parent and the Company. In furtherance and not in limitation of this Section
4.8(f), subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
each of the Company and Parent shall consult and cooperate with the other in
connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum,
brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or other legal proceeding. In
addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by Law,
in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or other
legal proceeding, each of the Company and Parent shall permit authorized
Company Representatives and Parent Representatives, respectively, (x) to
participate at or in each substantive meeting, conference or telephone call
with a representative of a Governmental Authority relating to such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or other legal proceeding and (y) to have
reasonable access to and be consulted in connection with any material
document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Authority
in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or other
legal proceeding. Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material

   

59 
--- 

  

--- 

    

provided to the other under this _Section 4.8(f)_ as "outside counsel only."
Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by
such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient
unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the
materials or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 4.8(f), materials provided to the other party or its
outside counsel may be redacted to remove references concerning the
valuation, pricing and other competitively sensitive terms from an antitrust
perspective in the Contracts of Parent, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries.

  



  

(g) During the period from the Agreement Date until the Closing Date, except
as required by this Agreement, Parent and its Affiliates shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Company, engage in any action or enter into
any transaction or permit any action to be taken or transaction to be entered
into by Parent or any of its Affiliates, that would reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

the Financing Commitments, by causing the Lenders to provide such Financing)
on or prior to the date on which the Closing is required to occur pursuant to
_Section 1.3_ , (v) in the event that the conditions set forth in Section 5.1

the Lenders) in the event of any breach thereof, (vi) comply with and maintain
in effect the Financing Commitments and (vii) in the event that the

Senior Notes due 2017, in the case of clauses (1) and (2), on or before
the Closing (and take all action required therefor, including providing any
required notices of prepayment or redemption, as applicable, by such times as
are necessary in order to repay such borrowings and obligations, and redeem
such notes, on or prior to the Closing).

  



  

(c) In the event that, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by
Parent to satisfy its obligations under _Section 4.9(a)_ , any portion of the
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms (including any market flex
provisions) and subject only to the conditions contemplated in the Financing
Commitments (unless such portion is not reasonably required to consummate the
Transactions), Parent shall promptly notify the Company thereof and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing for the
Required Amount as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
occurrence of such event; provided that such alternative financing shall not
have any of the effects described in clause (d)(i) below. Parent shall deliver

modification or waiver shall (A) reduce (or have the effect of reducing) the
aggregate amount of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees
to be paid or original issue discount in respect of the Financing), (B) add
conditions precedent to the Financing or amend, replace, supplement or modify

delay the availability of the Financing, (C) adversely impact the ability of
Parent to enforce or cause the enforcement of its rights under the Financing

agreed that Parent may amend the Financing Commitments to add lenders,
arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities that have not
executed the Financing Commitments as of the Agreement Date.

  



  

(e) To the extent Parent obtains alternative financing pursuant to _Section
4.9(c)_ , or amends, replaces, supplements, modifies or waives any of the
Financing pursuant to _Section 4.9(d)_ , references to the "Financing" and
"Financing Commitments" (and other like terms in this Agreement) shall be
deemed to refer to such alternative financing, or the Financing as so

(f) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably timely
basis and in reasonable detail of the status of Parent's efforts to arrange

breach or default by any party to any Financing Commitment, (iii)
Parent receives any written communication from any Person providing a
Financing Commitment with respect to any (A) actual, potential or threatened

Commitments with respect to a material provision of the Financing Commitments
or (B) a material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the
Financing Commitments with respect to the obligation to fund the Financings
or the amount of the Financings to be funded at Closing, or (iv) any other
event or development occurs that Parent expects to have a material and adverse
impact on the ability of Parent to obtain all or any material portion of the
Financings contemplated by the Financing Commitments on the terms, in the
manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Commitments or the
definitive documents related to the Financing or Parent, for any reason,
otherwise no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain all
or any portion of the Financing on the terms described in the Financing
Commitments. As soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within one
Business Day after the date the Company delivers to Parent a written request
therefor), Parent shall provide any information reasonably requested by the
Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (i) through (iv) of
the immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

(g) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to provide, such

requested by Parent, in each case at Parent's sole expense, including (i)
participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows,
drafting sessions, due diligence sessions and sessions with the Financing
Sources and ratings agencies, and reasonably cooperating with the
marketing efforts of Parent and its Financing Sources, in each case in

the Financing Sources in connection with the Financing, provided, that such
participation will be limited to the Company's executive officers and will be
solely for the purpose of providing information in relation to the Company,

information memoranda, and similar documents required in connection with the
Financing, (iv) taking such steps reasonably requested by Parent as may be

attach or otherwise become effective prior to the occurrence of the Closing,
(v) executing and delivering, on behalf of the Company's Subsidiaries, any
necessary pledge and security documents and otherwise reasonably facilitating
the granting of a security interest (and perfection thereof) in collateral,
guarantees, mortgages and other definitive financing documents as may
reasonably be requested by Parent; _provided_ that any obligations contained
in all such agreements and documents shall be subject to the occurrence of the
Closing and effective no earlier than the Closing, (vi) providing customary
authorization letters with respect to the information regarding the Company in
the

   

62 
--- 

  

--- 

    

bank information memoranda and (vii) using reasonable best efforts to obtain
surveys and title insurance at the expense of and as reasonably requested
by Parent on behalf of the Financing Sources; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would
interfere unreasonably with the operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Company, its Subsidiaries and
its and their respective officers, directors or employees shall not be
required, prior to Closing, to (a) authorize, execute, deliver or perform
under any agreement with respect to the Financing that is not contingent upon
the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing, (b) disclose any
confidential information to any party who is not subject to
customary confidentiality undertakings with respect thereto, (c) deliver any
assets to the possession of any other party as collateral, (d) pay any
commitment or other fees in connection with the Financing, (e) execute or
deliver any closing or officer's certificate, solvency certificate or similar
certificate, (f) publicly disclose any projections or other forward-looking
information, or (g) require any corporate authorization or approval, or
adoption of any resolutions, by the Board of Directors of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. The Company hereby consents to the use of the
Company's logos in connection with the Financing; _provided_ , that such
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to, nor reasonably
likely to, harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries. Parent shall be
responsible for all fees and expenses related to the Financing and shall
promptly reimburse upon request of the Company, all out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company
as contemplated by this Section 4.9. Parent shall, and hereby agrees to,
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
representatives from and against any and all Liabilities suffered or incurred
by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing, except to the
extent resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Company or its Affiliates. All non-public or other confidential information
provided by the Company or its representatives pursuant to this Agreement will
be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except
that Parent will be permitted to disclose such information to any
financing sources or prospective financing sources and other financial
institutions and investors that may become parties to the Financing (and, in
each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons
(i) agree to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto;
or (ii) are subject to other confidentiality undertakings reasonably
satisfactory to the Company and of which the Company is a beneficiary.

  



  

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent
acknowledges and agrees that its obligations to consummate the Merger or
any of the other Transactions is not contingent upon Parent obtaining the
Financing or any other third party financing, and Parent's failure to
consummate the Financing or alternative financing upon the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions in _Section 5.1 _ and _Section 5.2_ shall constitute
an Intentional Breach by Parent of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 4.10 _Certain Notices_. During the Pre-Closing Period, each of Parent
and the Company shall promptly notify the other Party of the occurrence of
any event that would be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of
Parent or the Company, respectively, to effect the Merger not to be
satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this _Section 4.10 _ shall not cure any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or
otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the Party
receiving such notice.

Section 4.11 _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Subs agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the
Transactions (including any communication required to be filed with the SEC)
shall be issued by any Party or its Affiliates without the prior written
Consent of the Company and Parent (which Consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required
by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any Governmental Authority to
which the relevant Party is subject, in which case the Party required to make
the release or announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
allow each other Party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance. The Company, Parent and Merger Subs
agree that the initial press release announcing the execution and delivery of
this Agreement shall be a joint press release of, and shall not be issued
prior to the approval of each of, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent,
on the other hand. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section
4.11_ , (i) Parent, the Parent Representatives, the Company and the Company
Representatives and Parent's and the Company's respective Subsidiaries may
make public releases or announcements concerning the Transactions that are
not materially inconsistent with previous press releases or
announcements made by Parent and/or the Company in compliance with this
_Section 4.11_ , (ii) Parent, the Parent Representatives, the Company and the
Company Representatives and Parent's and the Company's respective Subsidiaries
may make public statements in response to specific questions by the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial
analyst conference calls, so long as any such statements are not materially
inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made jointly by the Company and Parent and do not reveal material,
non-public information regarding the other Party or Parties, the Merger or
the other Transactions and (iii) the restrictions set forth in this _Section
4.11_ shall not apply to any release or announcement made or proposed to be
made in connection with, or in response to, a Change of Company Board
Recommendation that is effected in compliance with _Section 4.6_ or a Change
of Parent Board Recommendation that is effected in compliance with _Section
4.7_.

  



  

Section 4.12 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

  



  

(a) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which any director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Company
Employees_ ") will participate effective as of or after the Effective Time
(collectively, " _New Plans_ "), subject to applicable Law and applicable Tax
qualification requirements, Parent shall, or shall cause the Final Surviving
Company to, recognize all service of the Company Employees with the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that is reflected in the books and records of
the Company, as the case may be, for vesting, eligibility and level of
benefits purposes (but not for accrual purposes, except for vacation and
severance) in any New Plan in which such Company Employees will be eligible to
participate after the Effective Time, in each case except to the extent that
recognizing such service would result in a duplication of benefits. To the
extent any Company Employee participates in a New Plan that is a group health
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (a " _Parent
Welfare Plan_ "), Parent and any of its Subsidiaries will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and any insurer or service provider under the
applicable Parent Welfare Plan, cause all (i) pre-existing condition
limitations which otherwise would be applicable to such Company Employee and
his or her covered dependents to be waived to the extent satisfied under a
Company Benefit Plan comparable to such Parent

   

64 
--- 

  

--- 

    

Welfare Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date or, if later, immediately
prior to such Company Employee's commencement of participation in such Parent
Welfare Plan, (ii) participation waiting periods under each Parent Welfare
Plan that would otherwise be applicable to such Company Employee to be waived
to the same extent waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan
comparable to such Parent Welfare Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date
or, if later, immediately prior to such Company Employee's commencement of
participation in such Parent Welfare Plan and (iii) co-payments and
deductibles paid by Company Employees in the plan year in which the Effective
Time occurs to be credited for purposes of satisfying any applicable
deductible or out of pocket requirement under any such Parent Welfare Plan.
In addition, to the extent that any Company Employee has begun a course of
treatment with a physician or other service provider who is considered "in
network" under a Company Benefit Plan and such course of treatment is not
completed prior to the Closing, Parent will use reasonable efforts to arrange
for transition care, whereby such Company Employee may complete the
applicable course of treatment with the pre-Closing physician or other service
provider at "in network" rates.

  



  

(b) For any Company Employee that remains an employee of the Company, the
First Step Surviving Corporation or the Final Surviving Company, or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates (each a " _Continuing Employee_
"), Parent shall (x) for a period of 12 months following the Effective Time,
provide for cash compensation and bonus opportunity at least equal to the
aggregate economic value of the total cash compensation and bonus opportunity
(excluding equity compensation) that such Continuing Employee received
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (y) until December 31, 2016, provide
employee benefits (excluding equity compensation) no less favorable in the
aggregate economic value of the benefits under the Company Benefit Plans as
provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time
(which obligation, for clarification, only extends so long as such
individual remains an employee of the Company), and (z) and upon a
termination without cause of a Continuing Employee, provide
severance benefits consistent with Parent's policies for similarly situated
employees, giving effect to service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, _provided, however_ , the payment
for any Continuing Employee terminated within twelve (12) months following
the Effective Time shall not be less than the Transaction Severance Benefits
the Continuing Employee would have received had he or she been a Non-
Continuing Employee pursuant to _Section 4.12(b)_ , and _provided further,_
that if the Continuing Employee is entitled to severance and/or termination
payments or benefits pursuant to any written agreement between such Company
Employee and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or is entitled to receive
severance and/or termination payments or benefits pursuant to the Company
Change in Control Plan or the terms of any agreement or plan, the terms of
such agreement or plan shall govern in lieu of this paragraph if resulting in
the provision of greater benefits than this _Section 4.12(b)_. For purposes
of Section 409A of the Code, all such benefits will be paid consistent with
the terms of the arrangements that provide the greatest economic value to the
Continuing Employee.

  



  

(c) For any Company Employee that is not a Continuing Employee (each a "
_Non-Continuing Employee_ "), Parent shall provide such Non-
Continuing Employee with the severance payments and termination payments or
benefits under the applicable formula set forth, or otherwise described, in
_Section 4.12(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule or any higher amount of
severance and/or termination payments or benefits as may be required by

   

65 
--- 

  

--- 

    

applicable Law, any agreement between such Company Employee and the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or any agreement governing the
relationship between such Company Employee and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (such payments and benefits, the " _Transaction Severance
Benefits_ "). Except as otherwise required by applicable Law or the terms of
such Transaction Severance Benefits, Parent will pay or deliver the
Transaction Severance Benefits to any such Non Continuing Employee as soon as
reasonably practicable following the termination of such Non Continuing
Employee's employment.

  



  

(d) The Company and Parent or any Parent Subsidiary shall each use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take any action reasonably appropriate to
mitigate and/or minimize the impact of the tax consequences of Section 280G of
the Code (including as a result of the Transactions under all employment,
severance and termination agreements, other compensation arrangements and
Company Benefit Plans) on any individual that is regarded as a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section
1.280G-1).

  



  

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as
Parent may reasonably request so as to enable the First Step
Surviving Corporation and Final Surviving Company to effect such actions
relating to the 401(k) plan of the Company (the " _401(k) Plan_ ") as Parent
may deem necessary or appropriate, including amending and/or terminating the
401(k) Plan or any such other plan prior to the Effective Time, subject to
the terms of the 401(k) Plan or any such other plan and applicable Law
and provided that such action does not preclude the immediate participation
of the Company Employees in any successor 401(k) plan or other replacement
plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to applicable Law and
collective bargaining arrangements, the Company agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to terminate, prior to Closing, any Company Benefit Plan as
Parent may direct at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective
Time.

  



  

(f) This _Section 4.12_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 4.12_
, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section
4.12_. Nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any
particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) give any third party any right to
enforce the provisions of this _Section 4.12_ or (iii) require Parent or any
of its Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular Company Benefit Plan or (B)
retain the employment of any particular employee

  



  

(g) Parent shall (i) file with the SEC, no later than one Business Day after
the date on which the Merger becomes effective, a registration statement on
Form S-8, Form S-3, or another appropriate or successor form (or any other
appropriate or successor form), relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable with respect to the Company Options, Company RSUs, and Company
Performance RSUs assumed by Parent in accordance with _Section 1.5(a)(iv)_
and _Section 1.5(a)(v)_ (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such assumed
Company Options, Company RSUs, and Company Performance RSUs remain
outstanding; and (iii) deliver to each

    

66 
--- 

  

--- 

    

holder of an assumed Company Option, Company RSU or Company Performance RSUs
an appropriate notice setting forth such holder's rights pursuant to such
option or RSU

  



  

(h) Following the date hereof, each of Parent and the Company (and their
respective Affiliates) will use reasonable best efforts in all
matters necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section
4.12_ and the requirements of any applicable Law and will provide, and will
cause each of their respective representatives, including legal, human
resources and regulatory compliance personnel, to provide, all cooperation
reasonably requested by the other Party in that regard, including, (i)
cooperating and providing each other with all necessary and reasonable
assistance and information to ensure that any works councils or committees,
trade unions and/or employee representatives applicable to the Continuing
Employees are provided with the information required in order for proper
consultation, notification and other required processes under applicable Law
to take place, and (ii) exchanging information and data, including reports
prepared in connection with bonus plan participation and related data of
Continuing Employees (other than individual bonus opportunities based on
target bonus as a percentage of base salary), relating to workers'
compensation, employee benefits and employee benefit plan coverages,
including information and data that are necessary to support or perform any
compensation consultant process or that is otherwise reasonably requested in
connection with any compensation consultant process (in each case, except to
the extent prohibited by applicable Law or to the extent that such information
and data relates to performance ratings or assessments of employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries), making any and all required filings and
notices, making any and all required communications with Company Employees
and obtaining any Governmental Authorizations required hereunder.
Such cooperation will include the provision of any information and
consultation required by applicable Law, the terms of any Contract, or as
reasonably requested by the other Party. Each of Parent and the Company will
make available its representatives at such times and in such places as the
other Party may reasonably request for purposes of discussions with
representatives of any such works council, economic committee, union or
similar body.

  



  

Section 4.13 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

  



  

(a) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Final
Surviving Company shall (and Parent shall cause the Final Surviving Company
to) indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors, officers and
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Persons_ ") to the same extent such Persons are indemnified as of
the Agreement Date by the Company pursuant to applicable Law, the Company
Certificate, the Company Bylaws, and indemnification agreements in existence
on the Agreement Date and the comparable documents of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _D andO Indemnification Agreements_"), arising out of acts
or omissions in their capacity as directors, officers or employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. The
Final Surviving Company shall (and Parent shall cause the Final Surviving
Company to) advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
incurred in the defense of any Proceedings with respect to the matters
subject to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 4.13(a)_ in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws,
the DandO Indemnification Agreements and the comparable documents of its
Subsidiaries, in existence on the Agreement Date; _provided, however_ , that
the director, officer or employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries to whom
expenses are advanced undertakes, to

   

67 
--- 

  

--- 

    

the extent required by the DGCL, to repay such advanced expenses to the Final
Surviving Company if it is ultimately determined that such director, officer
or employee is not entitled to indemnification under applicable Law, the
Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws, the DandO Indemnification Agreements
and comparable documents of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law the certificate of formation and
limited liability company agreement of the Final Surviving Company shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors,
officers and employees of the Company for periods at or prior to
the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company Certificate
and the Company Bylaws. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the DandO
Indemnification Agreements shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall bind and purchase
directors and officers runoff insurance coverage (the " _D andO
Runoff Insurance_"), which by its terms shall survive the Merger for not less
than six years for the benefit of the Company, its Subsidiaries, the
Company's and any Company Subsidiary's past and present directors and/or
officers that are insured under the Company's current directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy in effect as of the Agreement Date. The
DandO Runoff Insurance shall provide coverage for the Company, its Subsidiaries
and such persons in their capacity as directors, officers and/or employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time that is not
less favorable in the aggregate than the Company's existing directors and
officers policy (true and complete copies which have been made available to
Parent) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the
best available coverage. The Final Surviving Company shall maintain the DandO
Runoff Insurance in full force and effect and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder for a period of six years after the Effective Time or,
if such policies are terminated or cancelled, obtain (subject to the
limitations set forth in the next sentence) alternative DandO Runoff Insurance
on substantially similar terms as set forth in this _Section 4.13(c)_.
Neither the Company nor the Final Surviving Company shall be required to pay
an annual premium for the DandO Runoff Insurance in excess of 300% (the "
_Maximum Amount_ ") of the last annual premium paid prior to the Agreement
Date (it being understood and agreed that in the event the cost of such DandO
Runoff Insurance exceeds the Maximum Amount, in the aggregate, the Company
shall remain obligated to provide, and the Final Surviving Company shall be
obligated to maintain, the broadest DandO Runoff Insurance coverage as may be
obtained for the Maximum Amount). The Company and Indemnified Parties may be
required to make reasonable application and provide reasonable and customary
representations and warranties to applicable insurance carriers for the
purpose of obtaining such DandO Runoff Insurance. Parent shall upon written
request furnish a copy of such insurance policy to each beneficiary of such
policy.

  



  

(d) In the event the Final Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries or their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and are not the continuing or surviving company or Entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of their
properties and assets to any Person, then proper provision shall be made so
that such continuing or surviving corporation or Entity or transferee of such
assets, as

   

68 
--- 

  

--- 

    

the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
4.13_ , without relieving Parent of its obligations under this
_Section 4.13_.

  



  

(e) The obligations under this _Section 4.13_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect in any material respect any
indemnitee to whom this _Section 4.13_ applies without the Consent of such
affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom
this _Section 4.13_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 4.13_ ).

(a) Each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
First Merger and Second Merger, taken together, to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. None of
the Parties shall (and each of the Parties shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries not to) take any action, or fail to take any action,
that could reasonably be expected to cause the First Merger and Second
Merger, taken together, to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The Parties intend to report and,
except to the extent otherwise required by Law, shall report, for federal
income tax purposes, the First Merger and Second Merger, taken together, as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

(b) Prior to the effectiveness of the Form S-4 Registration Statement, Parent
and the Company shall execute and deliver to Fenwick and West LLP tax

respectively. To the extent requested by Parent or the Company, each of
Parent, Merger Subs and the Company shall confirm to Fenwick and West LLP the
accuracy and completeness as of the Effective Time of the tax representation
letters made available pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.
Following the delivery of the tax representation letters pursuant to the
first sentence of this _Section 4.14(b)_ , the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause Fenwick and West LLP to deliver to it a tax
opinion satisfying the requirements of Item 601 of Regulation S-K under the
Securities Act. In rendering such opinion, such counsel shall be entitled to
rely on the tax representation letters referred to in this _Section 4.14(b)_.

  



  

Section 4.15 _State Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law becomes or is deemed
to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Subs, the Merger, including
by reason of the acquisition of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
thereto, the Company Stockholder Voting Agreements or any other transaction
contemplated to be consummated by the Parties pursuant to this Agreement, then
the Company Board shall take all action necessary to render such Law
inapplicable to the foregoing.

(h) All payments under this _Section 6.2_ shall be made by wire transfer of

(i) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Subs acknowledges that (i) the
agreements contained in this _Section 6.2_ are an integral part of the
Transactions, (ii) without these agreements, Parent, Merger Subs and the
Company would not enter into this Agreement, and (iii) none of the Parent
Termination Fee, Regulatory Termination Fee, Financing Termination Fee or
Termination Fee is a penalty, but rather constitute damages in a
reasonable amount that will, subject to _Section 6.2(j)_ , compensate Parent
or the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances in which such Parent
Termination Fee, Regulatory Termination Fee, Financing Termination Fee or
Termination Fee is payable. Accordingly, if a Party fails to pay in a timely
manner the Parent Termination Fee, Regulatory Termination Fee, Financing
Termination Fee or the Termination Fee, as applicable, and, in order
to obtain such payment, the Party to receive such fee makes a claim that
results in a judgment for the amount set forth in this _Section 6.2_ , the
Party paying such fee shall also pay to the Party receiving such fee its
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and costs of
counsel) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount
set forth in this _Section 6.2_ at the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A. in
effect from time to time from the date such payment was required to be

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that this Agreement is terminated as described in _Section 6.2(g)_  and the
Financing Termination Fee is paid to the Company (or its designee) in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall have the
right, exercisable by written notice to Parent within two Business Day after
receipt of payment of such Financing Termination Fee, to refund such
Financing Termination Fee to Parent, and in the event that Parent receives a
full refund of the Financing Termination Fee within two Business Day after
the delivery of such notice, the Company shall be entitled to all
remedies available to it pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)_ and _Section 7.7_. If,
after receiving a Financing Termination Fee, the Company fails to exercise
its right to refund the Financing Termination Fee in accordance with the time
periods provided for in this _Section 6.2(j)_ , the Company shall be deemed
to have irrevocably waived such right and Parent and its agents and
representatives shall have no further liability to the Company relating to or
under this Agreement, or with respect to the negotiation, execution,
performance or any actual or purported breach hereof or the Transactions, or
in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity, or in respect of
any representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made or alleged to
be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, except as set forth in _Section 6.2(a)(i)_. In
no event shall any Party be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee, the
Regulatory Termination Fee, Financing Termination Fee or the Termination Fee
on more than one occasion.

Section 6.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Company, Parent
and Merger Subs by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of
directors at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that,
after the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval or Parent Stockholder
Approval, there shall be no amendment that by Law or in accordance with the
rules of NASDAQ requires further approval by the Company Stockholders or
Parent Stockholders, as applicable, without the further approval of the
Company Stockholders or Parent Stockholders, as applicable. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the Parties
hereto.

  



  

Section 6.4 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Subs, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may
(i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other, (ii) waive any Uncured Inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties of the other contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance by the other with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein; _provided, however_ , that after
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder
Approval, there shall be made no waiver that by Law or in accordance with the
rules of NASDAQ requires further approval by the Company Stockholders or
Parent Stockholders, as applicable, without the further approval of the
Company Stockholders or Parent Stockholders, as applicable. Any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
by the Party or Parties to be bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement
or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure. The failure of any Party to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights.

  



  

Section 6.5 _General_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
_Section 6.3_ or _Section 6.4_ , in no event shall _Section 4.9(g)_ , this
_Section 6.5_ , _Section 7.6_ , _Section 7.8_ , _Section 7.9_ or _Section
7.13_ (or any other provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment,
modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify the
substance of _Section 4.9(g)_ , _Section 7.6_ , _Section 7.8_ , _Section 7.9_
or _Section 7.13_ be amended, modified, waived or terminated in a manner that
impacts or is adverse in any respect to the Financing Sources without the
prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

Section 7.4 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
of this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties hereto
agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit
the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace any
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is
valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be
enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the Parties hereto agree to
replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and
enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

  



  

Section 7.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Company

of them, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and, except as
otherwise

expressly provided herein, are not intended to confer upon any other Person
any rights or remedies hereunder.

  



  

Section 7.6 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall not be assigned by any Party without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, and any attempted assignment,
without such consent, shall be null and void _;_ _provided_ that Parent,
Merger Sub and Merger Sub II may assign all or a portion of their respective
rights hereunder to any Financing Source, including, without limitation, any
agent or other representative thereof, as collateral security for obligations
thereto in respect of the Financing, including any refinancings, extensions,
refundings or renewals thereof without the consent of the Company, but any
such assignment shall not relieve Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Sub II of
their respective obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each Party hereto and their respective permitted successors and
permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, other
than pursuant to _Section 4.13_ (Indemnification of Directors and
Officers), is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing clause (a), the Financing Sources shall be
third party beneficiaries of the provisions set forth in _Section 6.5_ , this
_Section 7.6_ , _Section 7.8_ , _Section 7.9_ and _Section 7.13_ (and such
provisions shall be enforceable against all parties to this Agreement by each
Financing Source and their respective successors and assigns).

  



  

Section 7.7 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an
adequate remedy for any such damage. It is accordingly agreed that prior to
any valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 6.1_ ,
(a) each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at Law or in equity and (b) the Parties shall waive,
in any Proceeding for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a
remedy at Law. Each Party further agrees that no other Party hereto or any
other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this _Section 7.7_ , and each Party hereto irrevocably
waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting
of any such bond or similar instrument. A party's pursuit of specific
performance at any time shall not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver
of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which such party may be
entitled, including the right to pursue remedies for Liabilities or damages
incurred or suffered by such party in the case of a breach of this Agreement
involving fraud or willful or intentional misconduct.

  



  

Section 7.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims arising out of
this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the internal Laws of the State of Delaware (whether arising in contract,
tort, equity or otherwise), without regard to any conflicts of law principles
