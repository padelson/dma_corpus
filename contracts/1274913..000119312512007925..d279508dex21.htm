WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, in furtherance of the acquisition of the Company by Parent and in
accordance with the terms hereof, Parent shall cause Sub to commence (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) an offer (the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all
of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Company (collectively, the " _Shares_ " or the " _Company Common
Stock_ "), other than shares of Company Common Stock directly owned by Parent
or Sub or held by the Company as treasury shares, for the consideration and
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that each of
this Agreement, the Merger (as defined herein) and the Offer is advisable,
fair to and in the best interests of the Company and the stockholders of the
Company (the " _Stockholders_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, and has determined to recommend that the Stockholders accept
the Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer and, if required by
applicable Law, vote in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger;

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and Sub have each approved this
Agreement and the respective transactions contemplated hereby, including the
making of the Offer and the Merger;

 

WHEREAS, it is further proposed that following the completion of the Offer,
Sub will merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), and the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "); and

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Sub to enter
into this Agreement, certain Stockholders have delivered to Parent and Sub a
support agreement (the " _Support Agreement_ "), dated as of the date hereof,
in substantially the form set forth in Annex II, providing that such
Stockholders have, among other things, agreed to (i) tender the shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by them in the Offer, and (ii) support
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, each on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in the Support Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree
as follows:

ARTICLE I

The Offer

 

Section 1.01. _The Offer_.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Article VIII hereof, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof
(but in no event later than the tenth (10th) business day following the public
announcement of the execution hereof), Sub shall commence (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), and Parent shall cause Sub to commence,
the Offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding Shares at a price per
Share equal to $26.00 net to the holder thereof in cash, without interest and
less any taxes required to be withheld as described in Section 3.04 (such
amount for each Share, or any different amount per Share that may be paid
pursuant to the Offer in accordance with the terms hereof, the " _Offer
Price_ "). The Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than any Shares held on behalf of third parties) will be
tendered pursuant to the Offer.

 

(b) The obligations of Sub, and of Parent to cause Sub, to accept for payment
and pay for any Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or prior
to the Expiration Date (the " _Tendered Shares_ ") shall be subject only to
(i) the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and (ii) the satisfaction or
waiver by Sub of the other conditions set forth in  _Annex I_ hereto (such
conditions, together with the Minimum Condition, the " _Offer Conditions_ ")
and the terms and conditions hereof. The Offer Conditions are for the sole
benefit of Parent and Sub and may be waived by Parent or Sub, in whole or in
part, at any time or from time to time, in their sole discretion, other than
the Minimum Condition, which may be waived by Parent and Sub only with the
prior written consent of the Company. Parent and Sub expressly reserve
the right to increase the Offer Price or to waive or to modify the terms or

tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer and not validly withdrawn a
number of Tendered Shares that, together with the Shares then owned by

 



2  Parent and Sub (if any) represents a majority of the sum of (x) the number
of Shares then issued and outstanding plus (y) all Shares which the Company
may be required to issue as of such date upon the vesting (including vesting
solely as a result of the consummation of the Offer), conversion or exercise
of all Company Options, the Company Warrants and any other derivative
securities, including warrants, options (other than the Top-Up Option),
convertible or exchangeable securities or other rights to acquire Company
Common Stock, regardless of the conversion or exercise price or other terms
and conditions thereof.

 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, the

the Offer. Sub may, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the
Company (in each case unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to
Article VIII), (i) extend the Offer, if at the then-scheduled Expiration Date
of the Offer any of the facts, events or circumstances described in any of the
Offer Conditions shall have occurred and be continuing, for one or more
successive periods of up to ten (10) business days per extension (the length
of such period to be determined by Parent and Sub) until the earlier to occur

discretion, waived or (B) the Outside Date, and/or (ii) elect to provide for a
subsequent offering period (and one or more extensions thereof) in accordance
with Section 1.01(g). To the extent requested in writing by the Company at
the then-scheduled Expiration Date of the Offer, Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause it to (in each case unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant
to Article VIII), extend the Offer, if at the then-scheduled Expiration Date
of the Offer any of the facts, events or circumstances described in any of the
Offer Conditions shall have occurred and be continuing, for one or more
successive periods of up to ten (10) business days per extension (the length
of such period to be determined by the Company) until the earlier to occur of
(A) the date such Offer Conditions are satisfied or, at Subs sole discretion,
waived or (B) the Outside Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 1.01(c) or elsewhere in this Agreement, in no event shall Sub be
required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date. Nothing in this Section
1.01(c) shall be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner
the right of Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII.

(d) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") containing the terms set forth in this Agreement and the
conditions set forth in _Annex I_ hereto. Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Sub to, on the terms and subject to the prior satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions of the Offer ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Minimum Condition
may not be waived without the written consent of the Company), accept for
payment and pay for all Tendered Shares as soon as practicable after the
Expiration Date (such time, the " _Offer Closing_ ").

 



3 (e) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Sub shall file with
the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer,
which shall contain the Offer to Purchase and a related letter of transmittal
and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein
pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or
amendments thereto and including the exhibits thereto, the " _Offer Documents_
"), and cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the Stockholders as

the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, with respect to the Offer, the
Company shall file a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9

obligations under this Agreement with respect to consummation of the Offer and
the Merger and payment or issuance of consideration contemplated by this
Agreement in respect thereof.

(g) Sub may, and the Offer Documents shall reserve the right of Sub to,
extend the Offer for a subsequent offering period (within the meaning of Rule
14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act) in compliance with Rule 14d-11
promulgated under the Exchange Act and all other provisions of applicable
securities Laws of not less than three (3) nor more than twenty (20) business

promulgated under the Exchange Act) immediately following the expiration of
the Offer. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and the Offer, Parent shall cause Sub to, and Sub shall, accept for

pursuant to the Offer as so extended by such subsequent offering period as
promptly as reasonably practicable after any such Shares are tendered during
such subsequent offering period and in any event in compliance with Rule
14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

(h) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company, or securities convertible into or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of such capital stock, shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, merger or other similar transaction, the Offer Price shall be
equitably adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such change; provided
that nothing in this Section 1.01(h) shall be construed to permit the Company
to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

Section 1.03. _Directors_.

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, promptly upon the initial
acceptance for payment by Sub of the Tendered Shares pursuant to the Offer
(the " _Acceptance Time_ ," the use of which term herein shall not depend
upon whether Parent shall exercise its rights under this Section 1.03)
representing at least such number of Shares as shall satisfy the Minimum
Condition, and from time to time thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to
designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on
the Company Board as is equal to the product of the total number of directors
on the Company Board (giving effect to any increase in the number of
directors pursuant to the next sentence) multiplied by the percentage that
the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent or its Affiliates
at such time (including Shares so accepted for payment and, if the Top-Up
Option is exercised, the Shares purchased upon the exercise of the Top-Up
Option) bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall be entitled to designate at least a majority of
the directors on the Company Board as long as Parent and its Affiliates
beneficially own a majority of the Shares of the Company. In furtherance
thereof, promptly upon the Acceptance Time, the Company shall, upon request of
Parent, promptly take all actions necessary to cause Parents designees to be
so elected or appointed, including (at the election of Parent), without
limitation, increasing the size of the Company Board and/or seeking the
resignations of one or more incumbent directors. At such time, the Company
shall, upon request of Parent, also promptly take all actions necessary to
cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute at least the same
percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of
(i) each committee of the Company Board, (ii) each board of directors (or
similar body) of each Subsidiary of the Company and (iii) each committee (or
similar body) of each such board. Prior to the consummation of the Offer, the
Company shall obtain irrevocable resignations of each director on the Company
Board, each such resignation to be contingent solely upon the consummation of
the Offer and the Companys acceptance of such resignation. The Company shall
make available to Parent complete and correct copies of such resignations
prior to the consummation of the Offer. Upon the consummation of the Offer,
the Company shall accept such number of resignations as will be necessary to
effectuate the exercise of Parents rights under this Section 1.03(a).

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Company
Board pursuant to Section 1.03(a) shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all
actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill
its obligations under this Section 1.03, including mailing to the
Stockholders together with the Schedule 14D-9 the information required under
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable Parents designees to
be elected or appointed to the Company Board. Parent shall supply to the
Company any information with respect to itself and its officers, directors and
Affiliates to the extent required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

 



6 (c) In the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to the
Company Board pursuant to this Section 1.03 then, until the Effective Time,
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Board to
maintain at least three (3) directors who are members of the Company Board on
the date of this Agreement and who are independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3
under the Exchange Act (the " _Independent Directors_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the number of Independent Directors is reduced below three
(3) for any reason, the remaining Independent Director(s) shall be entitled
to nominate an individual or individuals to fill such vacancy who shall be
deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no
Independent Directors then remain, the other directors shall designate three
(3) individuals to fill such vacancies who are independent for purposes of
Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, and such individuals shall be deemed to be
Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement; _provided, further,_
that after the Acceptance Time, the Company shall, upon Parents request, take
all action reasonably necessary to elect to be treated as a "Controlled
Company" for purposes of Listing Rule 5615(c) of the NASDAQ rules (or any
successor provision) and make all necessary filings and disclosures associated
with such status. The Company and the Company Board shall promptly take all
action as may be necessary to comply with their obligations under this
Section 1.03(c). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
from and after the time, if any, that Parents designees pursuant to this
Section 1.03 constitute a majority of the Company Board and prior to
the Effective Time, subject to the terms hereof, any amendment or termination
of this Agreement by the Company, any extension by the Company of the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Sub or
waiver of any of the Companys rights hereunder, will require the concurrence
of a majority of the Independent Directors (or in the case where there are two
(2) or fewer Independent Directors, the concurrence of one (1) Independent
Director) if such amendment, termination, extension or waiver would
reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on any holders of Shares
other than Parent or Sub.

Section 1.04. _The Top-Up Option_.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up
Option_ "), exercisable upon the terms and conditions of this Section 1.04, to
purchase that number of newly-issued Shares (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") equal to
the lesser of (i) the number of Shares that, when added to the number of
Shares held by Parent and Sub at the time of such exercise, shall constitute
one (1) Share more than the number of Shares necessary for Sub to be merged
into the Company pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL (after giving effect to
the issuance of Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Top-Up Option), and
(ii) the aggregate number of Shares that the Company is authorized to issue
under the Company Charter but that are not issued and outstanding (and are
not subscribed for or otherwise committed to be issued) at the time of
exercise of the Top Up Option.

 



7 (b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable, in whole or in part at any time at
or after the Acceptance Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
the Top-Up Option be exercisable (x) for a number of Shares in excess of the
number of authorized but unissued and unreserved Shares (including as
authorized and unissued Shares, for purposes of this Section 1.04, any Shares
held in the treasury of the Company) or (y) if any judgment, injunction, order
or decree shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of
the Top-Up Shares. Except as otherwise provided in Section 1.04(c), the
aggregate amount payable to the Company for the Top-Up Shares shall be equal
to the product of the number of Top-Up Shares and the Offer Price (the " _Top-
Up Consideration_ "). The Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the earlier to
occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms.

(c) The Top-Up Consideration shall consist of (i) an amount equal to the par
value of the Top-Up Shares, to be paid in cash, and (ii) an amount equal to
the balance of the Top-Up Consideration, which may be paid in the sole
discretion of Parent and Sub (x) in cash or (y) by issuance of a promissory
note (which shall be treated as payment to the extent of the principal amount
thereof) with full recourse to Parent, or any combination of the foregoing.
Any such promissory note shall (A) accrue simple interest at the rate per
annum of 5.0%, (B) shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of
execution and delivery of such promissory note, (C) may be prepaid at any
time and from time to time, without premium or penalty, (D) shall provide that
the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest under the promissory note
shall immediately become due and payable in the event that (x) Sub fails to
make any payment on the promissory note as provided therein and such failure
continues for a period of thirty (30) days or (y) Sub files or has filed
against it any petition under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or makes
a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, and (E) shall have no
other material terms. The Company Board has determined that the Top-Up
Consideration is adequate in accordance with the DGCL and otherwise taken all
steps necessary such that upon issuance and delivery in accordance with this
Section 1.04 the Top-Up Option Shares shall be validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable.

(d) In the event Sub exercises the Top-Up Option, Sub shall so notify the
Company in writing, and shall set forth in such notice (i) the number of
Shares that will be owned by Parent and Sub immediately preceding the
purchase of the Top-Up Shares, (ii) the place and time for the closing of the
purchase of the Top-Up Shares (which, subject to applicable Law and any
required regulatory approvals, shall be effected as promptly as practicable
and not more than two (2) business days after date such notice is delivered to
the Company), (iii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that Sub
intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option and (iv) the manner in
which Sub intends to pay the applicable exercise price. Such notice shall also
include an undertaking signed by Parent and Sub that Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Sub to, as promptly as practicable after such exercise of the Top-
Up Option and the delivery by the Company of the Top-Up Shares, consummate
the Merger in accordance with the terms hereof. At the closing of the purchase
of the Top-Up Shares, Parent or Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company
the Top-Up Consideration, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Parent
or Sub a certificate representing such Shares, which certificate may include
any legends required by applicable securities Laws.

 



8 (e) Parent and Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares will not be registered
under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption
thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Each of Parent
and Sub represents and warrants that Sub will be, upon the purchase of the
Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation
D under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and Sub represents, warrants and
agrees that the Top-Up Option is being, and the Top-Up Shares will be,
acquired by Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for
resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the
Securities Act.

(f) The parties agree that any dilutive impact on the value of the shares of
Company Common Stock as a result of the existence or exercise of the Top-Up
Option or the issuance of the Top-Up Shares, and any effect of the promissory
note, will not be taken into account in any determination of the fair value
of any Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL as contemplated
by Section 3.05.

Section 1.05. _Short Form Merger_. If, after the consummation of the Offer and
any exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of Shares beneficially owned by
Parent and Sub and Parents other Subsidiaries collectively represents at
least the number of Shares necessary for Sub to be merged into the Company
pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL, Parent shall cause Sub to, and Parent and
Parents other Subsidiaries shall transfer any Shares they own to Sub to
enable Sub to, and the Company shall execute and deliver such documents and
instruments and take such other necessary and appropriate actions in order to,
cause the Merger to be completed as promptly as reasonably practicable in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL, and otherwise as provided in Article
II below, without convening a Stockholders Meeting.

part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of
capital stock of Parent or Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

 



12 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock, Parent-Owned Stock and Sub-Owned Stock_.
Each share of Company Common Stock that is directly owned by Parent or Sub or
held by the Company as treasury shares immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_.

 

(i) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.01(b) and any
Dissenting Shares) shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
Offer Price paid in the Offer, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_
"). At the Effective Time, all such Shares shall cease to be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each Certificate or Book-Entry Share which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented any such Shares shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration therefor.

(ii) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company, or securities convertible into or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of such capital stock, shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares,
or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, merger or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such change; _provided_
that nothing in this Section 3.01(c)(ii) shall be construed to permit the
Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited
by the terms of this Agreement.

Section 3.02. _Exchange and Payment_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the
" _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
deposit, in trust for the benefit of holders of Shares, an amount of cash
sufficient to deliver to holders of Shares the aggregate Merger Consideration
to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.01. Any cash deposited with
the Paying Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ".
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund
payments due pursuant to Section 3.01, except as provided in this Agreement.
Parent shall pay the fees and expenses of the Paying Agent.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no
event more than three (3) business days after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of an outstanding certificate or

 



13  outstanding certificates (" _Certificates_ ") and to each holder of
uncertificated Shares represented by book entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares that
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect
thereto pursuant to Section 3.01(c), (A) a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in
customary form and contain such other provisions as Parent or the Paying
Agent may reasonably specify), and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 3.01(c). Upon
surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal (or, in the case of a Book-Entry Share, upon delivery of such
letter of transmittal or upon the entry through a book-entry transfer agent
of the surrender of such Book-Entry Shares on a book-entry account statement),
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably require
(a " _Proper Delivery_ "), the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.01 in respect
of the Shares represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration payable in
respect of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Payment of Merger Consideration
shall be made as promptly as practicable after the date of Proper Delivery of
the applicable Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

(ii) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such
Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

 

(iii) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.02(b), each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, pursuant to Section 3.01(c), without
any interest thereon.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid upon
the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the
terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, subject,
however, to Parent and the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any
dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time which 

 



14  may have been authorized by the Company and which remain unpaid at the
Effective Time. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective
Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for
transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery of cash to the holder thereof
as provided in this Article III.

 

(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying
Agent to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall
thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for,
payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
provisions of this Article III.

 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance
with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have been
surrendered prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger
Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America, or in certificates of deposit, or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then
publicly available). Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid solely to Parent. Nothing contained herein and no
investment losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall
diminish the rights of any holder of Certificates to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided herein.

(g) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond or surety in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect thereto, without any interest thereon.

 



15 Section 3.03. _Company Stock Options; ESPP; Warrants._

 

(a) _Company Stock Options._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board
shall take such actions that do not involve payments (other than as described
in this Section 3.03(a)) as may be reasonably necessary to provide that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding unvested Company
Stock Option shall become fully vested and each unexercised Company Stock
Option that is then outstanding shall be canceled, with the holder of each
such Company Stock Option becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash (the
" _Option Amount_ ") equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger
Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock then subject to such Company Stock Option. In
the event that the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject
to a Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be canceled with no payment due
to the holder thereof and shall have no further force or effect. Each holder
of a Company Stock Option shall receive from the Surviving Corporation, with
respect to such Company Stock Option, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time (and in all events by no later than five
business days following the first payroll date following the Effective Time),
without interest, the Option Amount, net of any required withholding of Tax.

(b) _ESPP._ As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall take such actions (to the extent not already
taken prior to the date of this Agreement) as may be reasonably necessary to
provide that with respect to the ESPP (i) participation following the date of
this Agreement shall be limited to those employees who participate immediately
prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, (ii) participants may
not increase their payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in
effect immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement
(unless otherwise required by the Code), (iii) no offering period shall
commence after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, (iv) each
participants outstanding right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
under the ESPP shall terminate on the day immediately prior to the day on
which the Effective Time occurs (if not earlier terminated pursuant to the
terms of the ESPP); _provided_ that all amounts allocated to each
participants account under the ESPP as of such date shall thereupon be used
to purchase from the Company whole shares of Company Common Stock at the
applicable price determined under the terms of the ESPP for the then
outstanding offering periods using such date as the final purchase date for
each such offering period, and (v) the ESPP shall terminate no later than
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) _Warrants_. Each Company Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled at the Effective Time and, in exchange, the
holder of such Company Warrant shall receive, in full settlement of such
Company Warrant, either a cash payment or an instrument representing
the right to receive upon exercise a cash payment equal to either (x) the
product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B)
the exercise price per share of such Company Warrant multiplied by (ii)
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Warrant or (y) such amount as may

 



16  otherwise be payable pursuant to the terms of such Company Warrant. As
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company Board shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions,
including using reasonable best efforts in obtaining any consents from holders
of outstanding Company Warrants, to effect the treatment of the Company
Warrants as described in this Section 3.03(c) pursuant to the terms of the
Company Warrant Agreements.

(d) _Waivers_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary waivers, consents or
releases, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, from
holders of Company Options and the Company Warrants and take all such other
action, in all cases, without incurring any liabilities in connection
therewith, as Parent may deem to be necessary or reasonably required to give
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.03. As promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plans)
shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be reasonably
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section
3.03 (unless such resolutions or actions have been adopted or taken, as
applicable, prior to the date of this Agreement).

 

Section 3.04. _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, Sub and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock, Company
Stock Options or Company Warrants and from any other recipient of a payment
hereunder such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation, Sub or
the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, Sub or
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options or Company Warrants or
to such other payment recipient, as applicable, in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, Sub
or the Paying Agent.

 

Section 3.05. _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time held by a holder who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares of Company Common Stock
(" _Dissenting Shares_ "), pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights_ "), shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead
shall be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be due
such holder pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law unless such holder fails
to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to such payment
or appraisal. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Dissenting Shares, except the right to receive the fair value
of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of

 



17  Section 262 of the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to
perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses any such Appraisal Rights or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to
the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, each such share of such holder
shall no longer be considered a Dissenting Share and shall be deemed to have
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 3.01(c)(i), without any interest
thereon. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Shares of Company Common Stock or
written threats thereof, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to Delaware Law received by the Company, and Parent shall have
the right to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands or
agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

ARTICLE IV

Representations and Warranties

Section 4.01. _Representations and Warranties of the Company._ Except as
disclosed in (i) any SEC Document filed by the Company and publicly available
on or after December 31, 2010 and prior to the date of this Agreement
(excluding any exhibits filed pursuant to section 3 or section 10 of the
Exhibit Table contained in Item 601 of Regulation S-K and excluding any
disclosures set forth in any risk factor section or in any other section to
the extent they are forward-looking statements or cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature) (a " _Filed SEC Document_ ") (it being understood
that any information set forth in any Filed SEC Document shall qualify a
specific representation or warranty contained in this Section 4.01 only to
the extent that it is reasonably apparent that such information would be
expected to qualify such representation and warranty, and provided that the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.01(c) (Capitalization)
shall not be qualified by any information disclosed in the Filed SEC
Documents) or (ii) the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent on
or prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ")
(it being understood that any information set forth in one section or
subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to each
other section or subsection of this Agreement to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent that such information is relevant to such other section
or subsection, other than, in each case, any matters required to be disclosed
for purposes of Section 4.01(c) (Capital Structure), Section 4.01(h) (Absence
of Certain Changes or Events) and Section 4.01(p) (Intellectual Property) of
this Agreement which matters shall be specifically disclosed in Section
4.01(c), Section 4.01(h) and Section 4.01(p) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
respectively), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as
follows:

(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power._ The Company is a corporation
duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of the State of Delaware.
Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly organized and validly existing under
the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, except where the failure to be
so organized or existing, individually 

 



18  or in the aggregate, would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each
of the Company and its Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate or similar
power and authority to carry on its business as presently conducted, except
where the failure to have such power or authority, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business
and, with respect to jurisdictions in which such concept is recognized, is in
good standing (in jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing)
in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified, licensed or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made
available to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement a complete and
correct copy of the Company Charter, the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the
Company and any amendments thereto through the date hereof (the " _Company
Bylaws_ ") and the comparable organizational documents of each of its
Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement. As of
any date following the date hereof, notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary and notwithstanding anything set forth in the
Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of its "significant
subsidiaries" (as defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X under the Exchange
Act) has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization under the U.S. federal
bankruptcy Laws or similar state, federal or non-United States Law, become
insolvent or become subject to conservatorship or receivership.

 

(b) _Subsidiaries._ Section 4.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists
each Subsidiary of the Company and, for each such Subsidiary, its
jurisdiction of organization. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of,
or other Equity Interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company have been validly
issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned, directly
or indirectly, by the Company free and clear of all pledges, liens, charges,
mortgages, encumbrances or security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever
(collectively, " _Liens_ "), other than Liens under applicable securities
Laws. Except as set forth in Section 4.01(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, there are no arrangements relating to the issuance, acquisition,
redemption, repurchase or sale of any Equity Interest or other ownership
interests of any Subsidiary of the Company, including any right of conversion
or exchange under any outstanding security, instrument or agreement. Except
for the capital stock of, or voting securities or equity interests in, its
Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital
stock of, or voting securities or equity interests in, any Person.

(c) _Capital Structure._  

(i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 150,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value
$0.001 per share (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ " and, together with the
Company Common Stock, the " _Company Capital Stock_ "). At the close of
business on January 6, 2012, (i) 80,398,198 shares of Company Common Stock
were issued and outstanding, (ii) zero shares of Company Common Stock were
held by the Company as treasury shares, (iii) 9,212,371 shares of Company
Common Stock were reserved and available for issuance pursuant to the Amended

 



19  and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (the " _2004 Plan_ "), of which
7,395,074 shares of Company Common Stock were subject to outstanding Company
Stock Options, (iv) 106,816 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved and
available for issuance pursuant to the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("
_ESPP_ " and together with the 2004 Plan, collectively, the " _Company
Stock Plans_ "), (v) 10,547,932 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved
and available for issuance upon exercise of the warrants (the " _Company
Warrants_ ") granted or issued pursuant to warrant agreements executed by
the Company, true and correct copies of which have been delivered to Parent
prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Warrant Agreements_ "),
(vi) no shares of Company Common Stock were owned by any Subsidiary of the
Company and (vii) no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued or
outstanding or held by the Company as treasury shares. The Company has made
available to Parent a list of each Company Stock Option issued as of January
6, 2012, the holder thereof, the number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable thereunder and the exercise price thereof.

(ii) Except as set forth above, at the close of business on January 6, 2012,
no shares of Company Common Stock or other Equity Interests of the Company
were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. Since the close of business
on January 6, 2012, through the date of this Agreement, other than in
connection with the issuance of Company Common Stock pursuant to the exercise
of Company Stock Options and Company Warrants outstanding as of January 6,
2012 (in accordance with the terms thereof as of such date), no shares of
Company Common Stock or other Equity Interests of the Company were issued and
there has been no change in the number of outstanding Company Stock Options or
Company Warrants. All outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock are, and
all such shares that may be issued prior to the Effective Time will be when
issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not
subject to or issued in violation of any purchase option, call option, right
of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right
under any provision of the DGCL, the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or
any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
otherwise bound. Except as set forth above in Section 4.01(c)(i) or in
Section 4.01(c)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no options,
warrants, calls, rights, convertible or exchangeable securities, stock-based
performance units, or Contracts to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound (i) obligating the
Company or any such Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be
issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock or other Equity
Interests in, or any security convertible or exchangeable for any capital
stock of or other Equity Interest in, the Company or of any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) obligating the Company or any such Subsidiary to issue,
grant or enter into any such option, warrant, call, right, convertible or
exchangeable security, stock-based performance unit or Contract. As of the
date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding contractual obligations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any shares of capital stock of the Company or any such Subsidiary.
There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the
Company having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for,
securities having the right to vote) on any matter on which the Stockholders
may vote.

 



20 (iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any
Contract, or is otherwise obligated, to contribute capital, loan money or
otherwise provide funds or make additional investments in any other Person,
other than any Contract entered into in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice with respect to wholly owned Subsidiaries of
the Company. Other than the Master Rights Agreement, there are no stockholder
agreements, voting trusts, proxies or other Contracts to which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which it is bound relating to the
voting or registration of any Equity Interests of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or preemptive rights with respect thereto. Prior to the
consummation of the Offer, the Company shall enter into an irrevocable
agreement with the requisite number of holders of Company Equity Interests to
terminate the Master Rights Agreement, which termination shall be conditioned
solely upon the occurrence of the Acceptance Time, and the Company shall make
available to Parent a complete and correct copy of such agreement to
terminate the Master Rights Agreement.

(d) _Authority; Noncontravention._

 

(i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the
Merger, subject, in the case of the Merger, to receipt of the Stockholder
Approval (if required by applicable Law). The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company and no Stockholder votes are necessary
to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby subject, in the case of the Merger, to receipt of the Stockholder
Approval (if required by applicable Law). This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by each of the other parties hereto,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject, as to
enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
other Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights
and to general equity principles. The members present of the Company Board,

Offer, the Top-Up Option and the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the
best interests of the Stockholders of the Company, (ii) authorizing, approving
and declaring advisable this Agreement, the Support Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Offer, the Top-Up

constitutes approval of this Agreement, the Support Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Offer, the Top-Up
Option and the Merger, for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL, (iii) causing
any Takeover Provisions to not apply or to have been satisfied with respect
to (A) Parent, Sub or any other Affiliate of Parent with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Support Agreement, or (B)
the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger, or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or the

 



21  Support Agreement, (iv) directing that this Agreement be submitted to a vote
at a meeting of the Stockholders of the Company for adoption and approval
(unless the Merger is consummated in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL
as contemplated by Section 1.05) and (v) resolving to recommend that the
Stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their shares pursuant to
the Offer and vote in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger if required by
applicable Law (such recommendation, the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "),
which recommendation constitutes an irrevocable recommendation and approval
of the Company Board for purposes of any Takeover Provisions. None of the
resolutions described in the immediately preceding sentence have been
subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way except in
compliance (but only in compliance) with Section 5.02(c).

(ii) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement do not, and
the consummation of the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the provisions
of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any breach or
violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, vesting, amendment,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit
under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, any provision of (i)
the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or the comparable organizational
documents of any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) (A) any contract, lease,
sublease, concession, franchise, indenture, note, bond, license, sublicense,
mortgage, indenture or other agreement (a " _Contract_ ") to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their respective
properties or assets are bound or (B) subject to the filings and other matters
referred to in Section 4.01(d)(iii) and assuming the consents, approvals and
authorizations referred to Section 4.01(d)(iii) are duly and timely made or
obtained, any statute, law (including common law), ordinance, rule or
regulation of any Governmental Entity (" _Law_ ") or any judgment, order,
writ, stipulation, injunction, arbitration award, settlement or decree of
any Governmental Entity (" _Judgment_ "), in each case binding on the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets, other
than, in the case of clause (ii) above, any such conflicts, violations,
defaults, rights, losses or Liens that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, or notice to, any federal, state, local or foreign

end adjustments which, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
material). The books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been
maintained in all material respects to support the preparation of the Company
Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. None of the Company or any of

based on information supplied by, or on behalf of, Stockholders of the
Company, Parent or Sub. The Schedule 14D-9, the Information Statement, the
Proxy Statement and the Other Filings to be filed with the SEC in connection
with the Offer and the Merger, and any amendments or supplements thereto, when

Company or any of its Subsidiaries, determined as of the date of this
Agreement).

(v) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any of
its employees, officers or directors or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
other Person has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as such term is
defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) that could
subject the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Parent to the Tax or penalty
on prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or to any
material liability under Section 502 of ERISA. There is no audit,
investigation, action, proceeding, arbitration, or material claim (other than

the Company, threatened with respect to any Company Benefit Plan. 

 



32 (vi) No Company Benefit Plan provides health or welfare benefits (whether or

compensation or benefits due to any current or former employee, director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) directly or
indirectly cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to transfer or set
aside any assets to fund any benefits under any Company Benefit Plan. No
amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of
property), as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement alone, or in combination with any other event relating
thereto, by any employee, officer, director, stockholder or other individual
service provider of the Company or its Subsidiaries (whether current, former
or retired) under any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise would not be
deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or would be subject to an
excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any indemnity obligation for any Taxes imposed under
Section 4999 or 409A of the Code.

(viii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material
unfunded liabilities pursuant to any Company Benefit Plan that is not intended
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and that is an "employee
pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (other than

accordance with GAAP, for all material unpaid Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, for all Taxable periods and portions thereof ending on or
before the date of such financial statements, other than any Taxes the non-
payment of which would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



33 (B) No material deficiencies, audit examinations, refund litigation, proposed
adjustments or matters in controversy with respect to Taxes (other than Taxes
that are not yet due and payable, that may thereafter be paid without interest
or penalty, that have been adequately provided for in accordance with GAAP or
for amounts being contested in good faith) have been proposed, asserted or
assessed in writing against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which have
not been settled and paid. All assessments for material Taxes due and owing by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any with respect to completed and
settled examinations or concluded litigation have been paid. There is no
currently effective agreement or other document with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries extending, or having the effect of extending, the
period for assessment or collection of any material Taxes.

"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution of
stock that was purported or intended to be governed by Section 355 or 361 of
the Code (i) in the two years prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii)
which could otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related
transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in
conjunction with the Merger.

with all applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes
(including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 3121 and 3402
of the Code and similar provisions under any United States federal, state,
local or foreign Laws) and have, within the time and the manner prescribed by
Law, withheld from and paid over to the proper Governmental Entities all
material Taxes required to be so withheld and paid over under applicable Laws,
except for Taxes the non-payment of which would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

services, branch, payroll, unemployment, customs duties, premium,
compensation, windfall profits, franchise, gross receipts, capital, net worth,

34 (ii) Section 4.01(o)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a list of

Subsidiary of the Company. Each of the leases or subleases of the real
property set forth in Section 4.01(o)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter
(each a " _Company Real Property Lease_ ") is legal, valid, binding,
enforceable and in full force and effect, except for such failures to be in
full force and effect that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Companys (and, as applicable, the
Companys Subsidiaries) possession and quiet enjoyment under each Company
Real Property Lease has not been disturbed, and there are no disputes with
respect to such Company Real Property Lease which, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. None of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company has received
written notice of default under any Company Real Property Lease by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
there is no default by any other party thereto, and no event has occurred that
with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute a
default thereunder by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, by any other party, in each case except as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(p) _Intellectual Property_. (i) Section 4.01(p)(i) of the Company Disclosure

Company License Agreements and other than implied or express licenses granted

Company, the Company IPR solely owned by or exclusively licensed to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries constitutes all Intellectual Property
Rights necessary for the exercise of the Covered Product Rights. Each of the
Company License Agreements is valid and enforceable against the Company or
the applicable Subsidiary, and to the Knowledge of the Company, the other
parties thereto, except for such failures to be valid and enforceable that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

(B) No academic institution, research center or Governmental Entity (or any
personnel of any of the foregoing) or other Person has any right, title or
interest (including any "march in" rights) in or to any Company IPR solely
owned (or purported to be solely owned) by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or to the Knowledge of the Company in or to any Company IPR
jointly owned by or licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is

by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries included in 4.01(p)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter (other than, with respect to the Company IPR

the Knowledge of the Company, no Person has, or has asserted in writing to

ownership, joint inventorship or any other right, title or interest in or to
any of the Company IPR, and there is no reasonable basis for any such claim.

complaint, claim, demand, communication or other written notice in the past
six (6) years with respect to the Covered Product, or two (2) years otherwise,

misappropriating or violating the Intellectual Property Rights of any third
party (including any notice that the Company or any Subsidiary must license or
refrain from using any Intellectual Property Rights of any third party), and,
to the Knowledge of the Company, no such claim has been asserted or
threatened orally or in writing, and there is no reasonable basis for such
claim. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is or has been a party

Subsidiary infringed, misappropriated or violated the Intellectual Property

(q) _Insurance_. Section 4.01(q) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth
a list of all material insurance policies (including information on the
premiums payable in connection therewith and the scope and amount of the
coverage and deductibles provided thereunder) maintained by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, which policies have been issued by insurers which are
reputable and financially sound and provide coverage for the operations
conducted by the Company and its Subsidiaries of a scope and coverage
consistent

payable thereon have been paid, (ii) none of the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company has received written notice of default under any such policy by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the Knowledge of the Company,

in receivership, conservatorship or liquidation and (iv) no notice of

years. Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, as of the date of this
Agreement there are no unfair labor practice charges or complaints pending
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before the National Labor
Relations Board or other employment-related charges or complaints pending or
threatened before any other government agency or authority, nor are there any

organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to
carry on its business as presently conducted, except where the failure to be

to jurisdictions in which such concept is recognized, is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing
or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing

would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) _Capitalization of Sub; Operations of Sub._ The authorized share capital

combination of cash on hand and available lines of credit or other committed
financing (evidence of which has previously been provided to the Company, if
not available through public sources) to consummate the Offer and the Merger

sufficient funds therefor on the Closing Date. Parent and Sub will have at and

expected to have the effect of preventing, making illegal or otherwise
interfering with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Offer and the Merger, except for those that, individually or in

Parent Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any unsatisfied Judgment

referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

 

(ii) Notwithstanding this Section 5.02(c) or anything else in this Agreement
to the contrary, at any time prior to the Offer Closing, the Company Board
may (A)

 



52  in response to an Intervening Event, take or fail to take the actions
specified in clauses (A), (D)(2) or (F) of Section 5.02(c)(i) (an "
_Intervening Event Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that it
is required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
Stockholders of the Company under applicable Law and (B) in response to an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal from any Person that is not
withdrawn and that the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with an independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
constitutes a Superior Proposal, cause the Company to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01(f); _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) no Intervening
Event Adverse Recommendation Change may be made and (y) the Company shall not
exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f)
until after (1) the period of three (3) business days (the " _Notice Period_
") following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company advising
Parent, in the case of clause (x) above, of the reasons for such Intervening
Event Adverse Recommendation Change, including a description of the
Intervening Event in reasonable detail, and, in the case of clause (y) above,
that the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal (or, in the event of a
material modification of a Superior Proposal with respect to which prior
written notice to Parent has been provided, the period shall be two (2)
business days), specifying the material terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal (or material modification thereto), identifying the Person making
such Superior Proposal and stating that the Company Board has resolved to
exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f),
(2) the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to,
during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and the Parent
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, so that
such Intervening Event would cease to necessitate an Intervening Event
Adverse Recommendation Change or such Takeover Proposal would cease to
constitute a Superior Proposal; _provided_ that, in the event of any material
revisions to the Takeover Proposal that the Company Board has determined
to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new
written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section
5.02 (including Section 5.02(c)) with respect to such new written notice and
the revised Superior Proposal contemplated thereby and (3) a determination by
the Company Board that the Takeover Proposal described in such written notice
constitutes a Superior Proposal after taking into account any changes to this
Agreement proposed and irrevocably committed to by Parent during such Notice
Period. None of the Company, the Company Board or any committee of the Company
Board shall enter into any agreement with any Person to limit or not to give
prior notice to Parent of its intention to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change or to terminate this Agreement in light of a Superior Proposal.

For purposes of this Agreement the term " _Intervening Event_ " means a
material event, development or change in circumstances with respect to the
Company occurring, arising or coming to the attention of the Company Board
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Offer Closing, and which
was not known, and could not reasonably be expected to have been known or
foreseen, to or by the Company Board as of or prior to the date of this
Agreement and was not known by the Companys management or reasonably
foreseeable as of or prior to the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall (1) the receipt, existence or

 



53  terms of a Takeover Proposal, (2) any events, developments or change in
circumstances of Parent, (3) clearance of the Offer and the Merger under the
HSR Act, (4) events, developments or change in circumstances described on
Section 5.02(c)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter or (5) any matter
relating to the foregoing or consequence of the foregoing, constitute an
Intervening Event. The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_
unsolicited written proposal made by a third party constituting a Takeover
Proposal not arising out of or relating to any violation of Section 5.02 that
if consummated, would result in any Person becoming the beneficial owner of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, which the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with an independent
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and taking into consideration,
among other things, all of the terms, conditions, impact and all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Takeover Proposal and this
Agreement (in each case taking into account any revisions to this Agreement
made or proposed in writing by Parent prior to the time of determination),
including financing, regulatory approvals, equityholder litigation, identity
of the Person or group making the Takeover Proposal, breakup fee and
expense reimbursement provisions and other events or circumstances whether or
not beyond the control of the party seeking to assert that a Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, (i) is not less likely to be consummated in
accordance with its terms when compared to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (ii) would result in a transaction that is more favorable
to the Stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the
transactions provided for in this Agreement (after taking into account the
expected timing and risk and likelihood of consummation).

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its Stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act;  _provided_ that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look
and listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms
the Company Board Recommendation within two (2) business days following any
request by Parent, or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act.

(e) The Company agrees that in the event any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives takes any action which, if taken by the Company, would
constitute a breach of this Section 5.02, the Company shall be deemed to be in
breach of this Section 5.02.

 

ARTICLE VI

 

Additional Agreements

Section 6.01. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ The Company shall
afford to Parent, Sub and their respective Representatives, reasonable access
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice during the period
from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement to all of its and its Subsidiaries
properties, 

 



54  books and records, and, during such period, the Company shall furnish as
promptly as reasonably practicable to Parent all information concerning its
and its Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request (which shall not include any environmental testing or
sampling without written consent of the Company). All requests for access and
information shall be coordinated through senior corporate officers of the
Company, or such other Person as designated in writing to Parent and any
access to or discussion with Company employees shall be subject to the prior
approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) of such senior corporate officers or other Person designated in
writing to Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or disclose
information where the Company reasonably determines that such access or
disclosure could waive the attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or contravene any Law or any Contract to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party so long as the Company has taken all
reasonable steps to permit inspection of or to disclose such information on a
basis that does not contravene the applicable Law or Contract or waive the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries privilege with respect thereto;
_provided, however,_ that such access and information shall be disclosed or
granted, as applicable, to external counsel for Parent to the extent required
for the purpose of complying with applicable Laws, including antitrust Laws,
nor shall Parent or any of its Representatives be permitted to perform any on-
site procedure with respect to any property of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the
confidentiality letter agreement, dated as of October 21, 2011, between
Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), each of Parent and Sub shall hold, and shall
cause its partners, members, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors
(including financial and legal advisors, consultants and accountants),
controlling Persons, financing sources and other Representatives to hold, all
information received from the Company or its Representatives in confidence in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.02. _Reasonable Best Efforts._ (a) Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees
to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the
taking of all acts necessary to cause the Offer Conditions and conditions in
Article VII to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable, (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities) and
the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver
from, or to avoid a Proceeding by, any Governmental Entity and (iii) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of,
this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, Parent,
Sub and the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no
event later than ten (10) business days after the date hereof, duly file with
the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") the
notification and report form required under the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



55 (b) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any
filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, in each case,
regarding the transaction, (ii) keep the other party informed of any material
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the FTC,
the Antitrust Division, or any other Governmental Entity and of any
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding the transaction and (iii) subject to
applicable Law, permit the other party to review, in advance, any written
communication given by it to or received from, and consult with each other in
advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the Antitrust Division, or
any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party regarding the transaction, any other person, and to the extent
permitted by the FTC, the Antitrust Division, or other applicable
Governmental Entity or other person, give the other party the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meetings and conferences subject to applicable
Law.

 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) respond as promptly as
practicable under the circumstances to any inquiries received from the FTC or
the Antitrust Division for additional information or documentation and to all
inquiries and requests received from either Governmental Entity, (ii) not
extend any waiting period under the HSR Act without the prior written consent
of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) and (iii) not enter into any agreement with any Governmental
Entity not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent and the Company shall,
from the date of this Agreement until the Outside Date, use their respective
reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have lifted, vacated or
terminated, any injunction or Judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay
the Closing; _provided_ that the parties shall have no obligation to commence
any Proceeding against any Governmental Entity.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Sections 6.02(a) and (b), if any objections are asserted or if
any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the
Antitrust Division or any other applicable Governmental Entity with respect to
any of the transactions contemplated hereby that would prevent or materially
impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts, and cause their Affiliates to use their
reasonable best efforts, to resolve any such objections or suits so as to
permit consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall not be required to
sell, divest, hold separate, license or agree to any other structural or
conduct remedy with respect to, any operations, divisions, businesses, product
lines, customers, assets or relationships of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries following the Merger), on

 



56  the one hand, or the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, which
(A) would materially and adversely affect the business of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) would require the sale, divestiture,
holding separate or license of the Covered Product to any third party or
materially impair the benefits expected by Parent as of the date of this
Agreement to be derived by Parent from the acquisition of the Covered Product
(any such action, a " _Non-Required Remedy_ ").

Section 6.03. _Employee Matters_. (a) Parent covenants and agrees that, from
and after the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor in accordance with its terms, all existing severance
agreements and arrangements and all obligations thereunder, in each case as
of the date of this Agreement, including any obligations arising as a result
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not preclude the Surviving Corporation
from amending or terminating any such Company Benefit Plan in accordance with
its terms.

(b) For a period of not less than twelve (12) months following the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide (i)
base salary and non-equity based bonus opportunities to each Person who is an
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time and who continues without interruption as an employee of the
Surviving Corporation (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) severance benefits to each Continuing Employee that are
no less favorable than those that would have been provided to such Continuing
Employee under the applicable severance benefit plans, programs, policies,
agreements and arrangements as in effect on the date hereof and (iii) employee
benefit plans and arrangements (other than severance, base salary and bonus
opportunities and any equity-based plans) to each Continuing Employee that
are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to each Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. Nothing contained herein
shall be deemed to limit the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
following the Effective Time to terminate the employment of any Continuing
Employee at any time and for any or no reason. Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, pay to each Continuing Employee an amount with
respect to such Continuing Employees bonus award for the fiscal year of the
Company in which the Closing occurs that is no less than the amount that was
paid to such Continuing Employee in respect of such Continuing Employees
bonus award for the immediately preceding fiscal year, which amounts shall be
paid in accordance with the short-term cash incentive policies approved by the
Compensation Committee of the Company Board and the awards thereunder;
_provided_ that such amounts may be increased on an individual basis in a
manner consistent with past practice.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall give or cause to be given
to each Continuing Employee full credit for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting under any 401(k) plan and health or welfare plan and
for purposes of determination of level of benefits under any vacation or paid
time off policy and severance plans provided, maintained or contributed to by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (any such plans, " _Parent Plans_ ")
covering Continuing Employees, for such Continuing Employees service
with the Company or any of its

 



57  Subsidiaries, to the same extent recognized by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable
Company Benefit Plan in which such employee participates, except to the
extent such credit would result in duplication of benefits.

(d) With respect to any welfare benefit plan of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i)
waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods and actively-at-work requirements with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees and their
dependents and beneficiaries under such plan to the extent waived or
satisfied under the applicable corresponding Company Benefit Plan and (ii)
provide each Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents and
beneficiaries with credit under such plan for any co-payments, deductibles and
similar expenses paid under corresponding Company Benefit Plans in the
calendar year in which such Continuing Employee (or his or her eligible
dependents or beneficiaries) become eligible to participate in such plan for
purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket or similar
requirements.

(e) The provisions contained in this Section 6.03 are included for the
sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing in this Agreement,
whether express or implied, shall create any third-party beneficiary or other
rights in any other Person, including any current or former employees, any
participant in any Company Benefit Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof. Nothing contained in this Agreement express or implied: (i) shall be
construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, contract or arrangement; (ii) shall limit the ability of
Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, following the Effective Time, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any benefit
or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract or arrangement at any time
assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them; or (iii) is
intended to confer upon any current or former employee (including any
Continuing Employee) or any other Person any right to employment or continued
employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to
a particular term or condition of employment.

Section 6.04. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance._ (a) All rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the
current or former directors and officers of the Company as provided in the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or any indemnification agreement between
such directors and officers and the Company or its Subsidiaries set forth on
Section 6.04(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (in each case, as in effect
immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement) shall be
assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action,
as of the Effective Time, and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

 

(b) The Certificate of Incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification,

 



58  advancement of expenses and exculpation of individuals who were directors or
officers of the Company prior to the Effective Time than are presently set
forth in the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years
from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any such individuals.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, in the event of any pending, threatened
or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any
Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer
of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") is, or is threatened to be, made
a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of,
or pertaining to the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, jointly and severally, shall indemnify
and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
reasonable and documented costs, reasonable and documented expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any such threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. Neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation for which indemnification has been sought by an Indemnified
Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes
an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise
or consent. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with an
Indemnified Party in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified
Party could seek indemnification hereunder. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall advance all reasonable and documented fees and expenses
(including without limitation reasonable and documented fees and expenses of
legal counsel, experts, litigation consultants, and the cost of any appeal
bonds) incurred by an Indemnified Party in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation. The Indemnified Party shall qualify for
advances, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, solely upon
the execution and delivery to Parent of an undertaking providing that the
Indemnified Party undertakes to repay the advance to the extent that it is
ultimately determined that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Company under the provisions of this Agreement, the
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation or applicable Law.
Parents and the Surviving Corporations obligations under this Section
6.04(c) shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years
from the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation asserted or made prior to the Effective Time or within such
period shall continue until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit
or proceeding. 

(d) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.04(c), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly

 



59  notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent
or the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified
Party except to the extent such failure prejudices the indemnifying party. In
the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified
Parties for any legal expenses of counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such
defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues
which raise conflicts of interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation
and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
satisfactory to them, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable and documented fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; _provided,
however,_ that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated
pursuant to this Section 6.04(d) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction,  _provided further, however,_ if
such counsel chosen to represent the Indemnified Parties has advised the
Indemnified Parties that such counsel has a conflict of interest were it to
represent all such Indemnified Parties, then the Surviving Corporation shall
be obligated to pay for more than one such counsel in a maximum number
sufficient to avoid any such conflicts of interest amongst the Indemnified
Parties; (ii) the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense of any
such matter; and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
liable for any settlement or compromise effected without their prior written
consent; _provided, further,_ that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party (and the
Indemnified Party shall repay any advances previously made) if and when a
court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to (and if the Company is unable to, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to) obtain and fully
pay for "tail" insurance policies (providing only for the Side A coverage for
Indemnified Parties where the existing policies also include Side B coverage
for the Company) with a claims period of at least six (6) years from and after
the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with benefits and levels of coverage at
least as favorable as the Companys existing policies existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or
the Transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such "tail" insurance policies shall not require the payment of an
aggregate premium in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate
annual premium most recently paid by the Company prior to the date hereof to
maintain the DandO Insurance (which amount is set forth in Section 6.04(e) of
the Company Disclosure Letter). If the Company and the Surviving Corporation
shall for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of 

 



60  six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place
in effect immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement
with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as that provided
under the Companys existing policies in effect immediately prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best
efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six (6)-year period with
benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided under the
Companys existing policies in effect immediately prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an aggregate annual premium
for such DandO Insurance or comparable DandO Insurance in excess of three hundred
percent (300%) of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the
Company prior to the date hereof to maintain the DandO Insurance (which amount
is set forth in Section 6.04(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter).

(f) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and other assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall cause proper
provision to be made so that such successors and assigns shall expressly
assume (including by operation of Law) the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.04.

(g) The provisions of this Section 6.04 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have from the Company
or any other Person by contract or otherwise.

Section 6.05. _Public Announcements._ The parties agree that the initial press
release to be issued on the date hereof or promptly after the execution of
this Agreement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be a joint press release by the Company and Parent. Thereafter, Parent
and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each
other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any other press release or
other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or the rules or
regulations of any national securities exchange or national
securities quotation system, in each which case the party required to make
such release or statement shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, allow
the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or statement in
advance of such issuance;  _provided_ , _however_ , that each party may
without consultation with the other party issue any such press releases or
make any such public statements in connection with any dispute between the
parties hereto regarding this Agreement or the Transactions that is required
by applicable Law to be disclosed publicly. The Company shall, and shall cause
its Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to make solicitations and
recommendations to Stockholders for purposes of causing the facts, events or
circumstances described in the conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex I_
to cease to be in existence and the conditions to the Merger to be satisfied.

 



61 Section 6.06. _Offer Documents; Proxy Statement._ The Offer Documents,
the Schedule 14D-9 and, to the extent required by applicable Law, the Proxy
Statement shall comply in all material respects with the provisions of
applicable federal securities Laws. Parent, Sub and the Company shall take all
steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9, and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, the Proxy Statement to be filed with the
SEC and to be disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case,
as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. Each of
Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company on the other hand, shall
furnish to the Company or Parent and Sub, as the case may be, any and all
information relating to Parent and Sub, on the one hand, or the Company on
the other hand, required to be included in the Offer Documents, the Schedule
14D-9 and, to the extent required by applicable Law, the Proxy Statement. Each
of the Company and its counsel, on the one hand, and Parent and Sub and
their counsel, on the other hand, shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, the Proxy Statement before they are filed
with the SEC. Each of the Company, Sub and Parent shall (i) promptly correct
any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents or the Schedule
14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall become false or
misleading in any material respect, (ii) notify the other party in writing,
prior to the Offer Closing, of the occurrence of any event which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents or the Schedule
14D-9, and (iii) notify the other party in writing, prior to the Effective
Time, of the occurrence of any event which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement (to the extent required by applicable
Law). With the cooperation of the other party (including consulting with the

ARTICLE VIII

 

Termination, Amendment and Waiver

Section 8.01. _Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of Stockholder
Approval (if required under the DGCL): 

(a) subject to Section 1.03(c) by mutual written consent of Parent, Sub and
the Company;

 



65 (b) by either Parent or the Company:

 

(i) if the Offer shall not have been consummated on or before May 7, 2012;
_provided, however,_ that if the Acceptance Time has not occurred by May 7,
2012, but on such date none of the facts, events or circumstances described in
the Offer Conditions, other than the conditions set forth in Sections (i)
and/or (ix) of _Annex I_ , shall have occurred or be continuing, then neither
party is permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.01(b)(i) until July 7, 2012 (any such date, the " _Outside Date_ ");
_provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 8.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any party that has breached
its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have been the
primary cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Acceptance Time to have
occurred on or before such date;

(ii) if any Restraint enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of
the Offer or the Merger shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_
that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.01(b)(ii) shall have used reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry of
and to remove such Restraint as required by Section 6.02;

(iii) in the event that the Offer expires or is terminated in accordance with
its terms without any Shares being purchased thereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.01(b)(iii) shall not be available to any party that has breached its
obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have been the
primary cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Shares to be purchased
pursuant to the Offer;

 

(c) prior to the Offer Closing, by Parent, if the Company shall have breached
any of its representations or warranties or failed to perform any of its
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure
to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of the condition set forth in
Section (vii) of _Annex I_ hereto and (ii) is incapable of being cured by the
Outside Date or, if capable of being cured by the Company by the Outside Date,
is not cured by the Company within thirty (30) calendar days after the Company
receives written notice of such breach from Parent or Sub;  _provided_ that
Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.01(c) if Parent or Sub is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder; 

(d) prior to the Offer Closing, by the Company, if (i) Parent or Sub shall
have breached any of their respective representations or warranties set forth
in this Agreement, which breach would result in any such representations and
warranties of Parent or Sub set forth in this Agreement not being true and
correct as of immediately prior to the Offer Closing (except to the extent
such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in
which case as of such earlier date), except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct as of such dates
without giving effect to any qualification and limitations as to
"materiality" or "Parent Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, or (ii) Parent or Sub shall not have in all material respects
performed all covenants and agreements required to be performed by them under
this Agreement on or prior to the consummation of the Offer, in each case
which 

 



66  breach or failure to perform is incapable of being cured by Parent or Sub by
the Outside Date or, if capable of being cured by Parent or Sub by the Outside
Date, is not cured by Parent or Sub, as applicable, within thirty (30)
calendar days after Parent or Sub, as applicable, receives written notice of
such breach from the Company; _provided_ that the Company shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(d) if the
Company is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements hereunder;

(e) by Parent, (i) in the event that an Adverse Recommendation Change shall
have occurred, (ii) Parent shall have received written notice from the Company
to the effect that the Company intends to terminate this Agreement in

under Section 5.02; or

 

(f) prior to the Offer Closing, by the Company, in accordance with the terms
and subject to the conditions of Section 5.02(c)(ii)(B); _provided_ that the
right of the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.01(f) is conditioned on and subject to compliance with the terms and
conditions of Section 5.02(c) and the compliance by the Company with its
obligations under Section 8.03(a), and any purported termination pursuant to
this Section 8.01(f) shall be void and of no force or effect if the Company
shall not have complied with its obligations under Section 8.03(a).

Section 8.02. _Effect of Termination._ In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.01, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company, other than
the provisions of the final sentence of Section 6.01, Section 6.07, this
Section 8.02, Section 8.03 and Article IX, which provisions shall survive such
termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve the
Company, Parent or Sub from liability for any willful and material breach of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement prior to such termination, and the aggrieved party shall be
entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any party be liable for
punitive damages.

 

Section 8.03. _Company Termination Fee_. In the event that:

 

(a) (i) This Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.01(f), then the Company shall, concurrently with such termination: (A) pay
to Parent by wire transfer of same-day funds all reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket expenses of Parent and Sub incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, not to exceed $10,000,000
(the " _Expense Reimbursement_ "); and (B) issue a promissory note for the
amount of the Company Termination Fee, _minus_ any Expense Reimbursement paid,
in favor of Parent that shall accrue simple interest at the rate equal to the
prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such promissory note is
issued, which shall mature on the earlier of (1) the date the Superior
Proposal accepted by the Company pursuant to Section 5.02(c)(ii)(B)
is consummated or (2) the six (6) - month anniversary of the date of
termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(f),

 



67 (b) This Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(e), then
the Company shall pay Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of
same-day funds immediately following such termination of this Agreement, or

(c) (i) After the date of this Agreement, a Takeover Proposal shall have been
announced, commenced, publicly disclosed or made known to the Company Board,
(ii) thereafter, this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) or Section 8.01(b)(iii) or by Parent pursuant
to Section 8.01(c) and (iii) at any time after the execution of this Agreement
and prior to the expiration of the twelfth (12th) month after the termination
of this Agreement, the Company consummates a Takeover Proposal or enters into
any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other
similar Contract related to a Takeover Proposal or to commercialization rights
for the Covered Product (whether exclusive or non-exclusive), then the
Company shall pay Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-
day funds on the date of consummation of the transaction contemplated by any
Takeover Proposal referred to in clause (iii) above or on the date of entry
into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or
other similar Contract related commercialization rights for the Covered
Product (whether exclusive or non-exclusive).

 

(d) For purposes of:

(i) Section 8.03(c), the term " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall have the meaning
assigned to such term in Section 5.02(a) except that all references to "15%"
therein shall be deemed to be references to "35%".

(ii) This Section 8.03, the " _Company Termination Fee_ " means $75,879,404
(inclusive of Parents and Subs expenses), in cash.

(e) Each of the Company, Parent, and Sub acknowledges that (i) the agreements
contained in Section 8.03(a), (b) and (c) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) without these agreements
Parent and Sub would not enter into this Agreement and (iii) the Company
Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that is intended to compensate Parent and Sub in the
circumstances in which such Company Termination Fee is payable. Accordingly,
if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section
8.03(a), (b) or (c) and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a
suit that results in a judgment against the Company or any successor of the
Company for the amount set forth in Section 8.03(a), (b) or (c) or any portion
thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred by the Parent and its Affiliates in connection with
such suit, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the
prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made through the date of payment. If the Company Termination Fee is paid
when and as due in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.03(a), in
connection with a termination otherwise in accordance with the terms of
Section 8.01, such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to
Parent and Sub, except in a circumstance where Seller has otherwise
intentionally breached its obligations under this Agreement.

 



68 Section 8.04. _Amendment_. Subject to Section 1.03(c), this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto at any time before or after the Offer
Closing shall have occurred or the Stockholder Approval, if required by
applicable law, has been obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) after the
Offer Closing, there shall be no amendment that decreases the Merger
Consideration and (b) after receipt of Stockholder Approval (if required by
applicable Law), this Agreement may not be amended if applicable Law requires
further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such approval
having been obtained. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

Section 8.05. _Extension; Waiver._ Subject to Section 1.03(c), any time prior
to the Effective Time, the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) to the
extent permitted by Law, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or
(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after receipt of Stockholder Approval
(if required by applicable Law), no extension or waiver may be made that, by
Law, requires further approval by such stockholders without the further
approval of such stockholders. Any agreement on the part of a party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.
