to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Parent (i)&nbsp;has implemented and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to
ensure that information relating to Parent that is required to be disclosed in the reports Parent
files or submits under the Exchange Act, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of Parent, and (ii)&nbsp;has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to
the date hereof, to Parent&#146;s outside auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board of
Directors (A)&nbsp;any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent&#146;s ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (B)&nbsp;any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Parent&#146;s internal controls over financial reporting.
These disclosures were made in writing by management to Parent&#146;s auditors and audit committee and a
copy has previously been made available to the Company. There is no reason to believe that
Parent&#146;s outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be
able to give the certifications and attestations
