   ##### 

  

  

262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under
Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right
of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal
Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have
become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
1.4_ without interest. The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any
demands for appraisal of any of the Common Shares, attempted withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received

otherwise required under the DGCL, voluntarily make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit
to do any of the foregoing. 

   

 Section 1.9 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_.

No such holder will be entitled to dividends, voting rights, or any other rights as a stockholder in respect to any fractional shares. 

  

 Section 1.11 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended by the parties hereto that, for United States federal income tax purposes, the Integrated Merger is intended to be part of an integrated plan and is intended to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

to _Section 1.4_ in exchange for outstanding Common Shares. Any income
from investment of the Exchange Fund, which investment shall be made in
accordance with the instructions of Parent, will be payable solely to
Parent. 

   

 Section 2.2 _Exchange Procedures_. 

 

 (a) As soon as practicable and not later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding Common Shares subsequently converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as set forth in _Section 1.4_: (i) a letter of transmittal (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") that (A) shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof, together with any bond or indemnity agreement, as contemplated by _Section 2.6_) and (B) shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the Interim Surviving Corporation or Parent may reasonably specify; and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section 2.2_, each such Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration.

  

 (c) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the appropriate amount of the Merger Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Common Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and otherwise in proper form for transfer and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Interim Surviving Corporation to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable Taxes have been paid.

  

 (d) No dividends or other distributions, if any, declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Stock Merger Consideration to be issued in exchange therefor until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this _Section 2.2_. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of the Stock Merger Consideration issued in

    ##### 

  

     

exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount
of dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of the
Stock Merger Consideration. No interest shall be payable on any cash
deliverable upon the exchange of any Common Shares for Cash Merger
Consideration. 

   

 Section 2.3 _No Further Ownership Rights_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of the Certificates representing Common Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Common Shares and, after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the transfer books of the Interim Surviving Corporation of the Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Interim Surviving Corporation or the Final Surviving Entity, for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_, subject to applicable Law in the case of Appraisal Shares. 

  

 Section 2.4 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the former Company Stockholders on the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Final Surviving Entity upon demand, and any former holder of Common Shares who has not theretofore received any applicable Merger Consideration to which such Company Stockholder is entitled under this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Final Surviving Entity (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of claims with respect thereto and only as a general creditor thereof. 

  

 Section 2.5 _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Interim Surviving Corporation or the Final Surviving Entity shall be liable to any holder of Common Shares for any part of the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Common Shares two years after the Effective Time or at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law or Order, become the property of the Final Surviving Entity free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto. 

  

 Section 2.6 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by and at the discretion of Parent, the Interim Surviving Corporation or the Final Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent, the Interim Surviving Corporation or the Final Surviving Entity may direct, or the execution and delivery by such Person of an indemnity agreement in such form as Parent, the Interim Surviving Corporation or the Final Surviving Entity may direct, in each case as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Interim Surviving Corporation or the Final Surviving Entity with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the appropriate amount of the Merger Consideration.

Each Parent Report has complied, or will comply as the case may be, in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as applicable, each as in effect on the date so filed. None of the Parent Reports (including any financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference therein) contained or will contain, as the case may be, when filed (and, in the case of registration statement and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of mailing, respectively) any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits or will omit, as the case may be, to state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were or are made, not misleading. No executive officer of Parent has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302, 404 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to any Parent Report. Between December 31, 2009 and the date hereof, no event has occurred (other than the execution of this Agreement) that requires or will require Parent to file a Form 8-K with the SEC that has not been filed prior to the date hereof by Parent.

 (c) Parent has implemented and maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP.

These disclosures were made in writing by management to Parents auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made available to the Company. There is no reason to believe that Parents outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations 

      ##### 

  

    

required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when due.

Neither Parent nor the Company shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Entity to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable Laws, without the prior written consent of the other parties (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall require or be construed to require Parent or any of its Affiliates, in order to obtain the consent or successful termination of any review of any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger, to (i) sell or hold separate, or agree to sell or hold separate, before or after the Effective Time, any assets, businesses or any interests in any assets or businesses, or Parent or any of its Affiliates or of the Interim Surviving Corporation or the Final Surviving Corporation (or to consent to any sale, or agreement, by Parent or by the Interim Surviving Corporation or the Final Surviving Entity of any assets or businesses, or any interests in any assets or businesses), or any change in or restriction on the operation by Parent of any assets or businesses (including any assets or businesses of the Interim Surviving Corporation or the Final Surviving Entity), (ii) enter into any contract or be bound by any obligation that Parent may deem in its sole discretion to have an adverse effect on the benefits to Parent of the Merger, (iii) modify any of the terms of this Agreement or the Merger, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or (iv) initiate or participate in any legal proceeding with respect to such matters. 

   

 Section 5.5 _Proxy Statement; Registration Statement_. As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, and in any event within thirty (30) days of the date of the Agreement, the Company will prepare the Proxy Statement, and Parent will prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of Parent and the Company shall provide promptly to the other such information concerning its business affairs and financial statements as, in the reasonable 

   ##### 

  

    

judgment of the providing party or its counsel, may be required or
appropriate for inclusion in the Proxy Statement and the Registration
Statement pursuant to this _Section 5.5_, or in any amendments or
supplements thereto, and shall cause its counsel and auditors to cooperate
with the others counsel and auditors in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement and the Registration Statement. Each of Parent and the Company will
respond to any comments from the SEC, and will use all reasonable efforts
to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable (but in no event prior to such time
as all waiting periods (and any extensions thereof) under the HSR Act and
other applicable Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby
expire or terminate early and any objections raised by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby have been
resolved), and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is
necessary to consummate the Mergers and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Parent shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders of its
capital stock as the Company may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation of the Proxy Statement. Each of Parent and the Company will
notify the other promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
its staff in connection with the filing of, or amendments or supplements to,
the Registration Statement and/or the Proxy Statement. Parent shall promptly
inform the Company if, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or
circumstance relating to Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub or
any of their respective officers or directors, is discovered by Parent that
should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement or
the Registration Statement. The Company shall promptly inform Parent if, at
any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance relating to
the Company, or any of its officers or directors, is discovered by the
Company that should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the
Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement. Except in connection with the
withdrawal or modification by the Company Board of Directors of its approvals
or recommendations of the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby and
other than pursuant to Rule 425 of the Securities Act with respect to
releases made in compliance with _Section 5.8_ of this Agreement, no
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement,
nor any response to any comments or inquiry from the SEC with respect to such
filings, will be made by the Company or Parent without the approval of the
other party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed (it being understood that it shall be unreasonable to withhold
consent with respect to any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or
Registration Statement to the extent such amendment or supplement is required
to be included therein so that the Proxy Statement or Registration Statement
will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading as may be required by Rule 10b-5 or Rule 14a-9 under
the Exchange Act or Section 11 or Section 12 of the Securities Act). The
Company and Parent each will advise the other promptly after it receives
notice of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or
any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop
order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement
or the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information. Each of the parties
hereto shall cause the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement to
comply as to form and substance as to such party in 

   ##### 

  

    

all material respects with the applicable requirements of (i) the Exchange
Act, (ii) the Securities Act, and (iii) the rules and regulations of Nasdaq
and the NYSE. 

  

 Section 5.6 _Company Stockholders Meeting_. After the Registration Statement is declared effective and the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC, the Company, acting through the Company Board of Directors, shall take all actions in accordance with applicable Law, the Company Certificate of Incorporation, the Company By-laws and the rules of Nasdaq to promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as practicable the Company Stockholders Meeting for the sole purpose of considering and voting upon the adoption of the "agreement of merger" (as such term is used in Section 251 of the DGCL) contained in this Agreement. Subject to _Section 5.7(c)_ , to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) the Company Board of Directors shall recommend adoption of the "agreement of merger" (as such term is used in Section 251 of the DGCL) contained in this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the Company Stockholders and include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (ii) neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the Company Board of Directors that the Company Stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the "agreement of merger" (as such term is used in Section 251 of the DGCL) contained in this Agreement and approval of the Merger. Unless this Agreement has been duly terminated in accordance with the terms herein (including payment of any termination fees payable under Article VII), the Company shall, subject to the right of the Company Board of Directors to modify its recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent under certain circumstances as specified in _Section 5.7(c)_, take all lawful action to solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the "agreement of merger" (as such term is used in Section 251 of the DGCL) contained in this Agreement and approve the Merger and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the Company Stockholders that is required by the rules of Nasdaq or the DGCL. The Company shall keep Parent updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably requested by Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with Parent, may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any legally required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Company Stockholders or, if as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting. 

  

 Section 5.7 _No Solicitation of Transactions_. 

  

 (a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, Representatives and any other agents to immediately cease any discussions, negotiations or communications with any party or parties with respect to any Competing Transaction. The Company shall notify in writing each party with which the Company has, in the last twelve months, held any discussions, negotiations or communications with respect to a Competing Transaction and that remain in possession of non-public information in respect of the Company that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company and its Affiliates in connection with such discussions to return or destroy all such information in accordance with and subject to the terms of the applicable nondisclosure agreement between the Company and such party. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any Affiliate or Representative of the Company to, (i) solicit, initiate or intentionally encourage the submission of, any Competing Transaction or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Third Party any information or data with respect to or provide access to the properties, offices, books, records, officers, directors or employees of, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate, induce or encourage the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, (i) the Company has complied with this _Section 5.7_, and (ii) the Company Board of Directors reasonably determines in good faith that a Competing Transaction constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Competing Transaction, then, to the extent required by the fiduciary obligations of the Company Board of Directors, as determined in good faith by a majority thereof after consultation with the Companys outside counsel, the Company may, subject to the Companys providing prior written notice to Parent of its decision to take such action and compliance by the Company with _Section 5.7(d)_, furnish information with respect to the Company to, and participate in discussions and negotiations directly or through its Representatives with, such Third Party, subject to a confidentiality agreement not materially less favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 (c) Neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval and recommendation by the Company Board of Directors of the Merger, this Agreement and the "agreement of merger" (as such term is used in Section 251 of the DGCL) contained herein, the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and the actions taken in connection herewith and therewith, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose or resolve to approve or recommend, any Competing Transaction, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose or resolve to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any Acquisition Agreement, (iv) approve or recommend, or propose or resolve to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any written agreement requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger, this Agreement, any Transaction Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (v) take any action necessary to render the provisions of any Antitakeover Law inapplicable to any Competing Transaction, or (vi) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing constituting or related to, or that is intended to lead to, any Competing Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, in response to a Superior Competing Transaction that was not solicited, initiated, intentionally encouraged, participated in or otherwise facilitated by the Company in breach of _Section 5.7(b)_, the Company Board of Directors may, if it determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board of Directors to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law or Order, (1) modify, or propose or resolve to modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approvals and recommendations of the Company Board of Directors of the Merger, or the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Transaction Documents, or (2) terminate the Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1(d)_. 

   

 (d) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than thirty-six (36) hours) after it obtains Knowledge of the receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Competing Transaction, or of any inquiry that would reasonably be 

    ##### 

  

    

expected to lead to a Competing Transaction. In such notice, the Company
shall identify the Third Party making, and details of the material terms and
conditions of, any such Competing Transaction. The Company shall keep Parent
fully informed, on a current basis, of the status and material terms of any
such Competing Transaction, including any material amendments or proposed
amendments as to price and other material terms thereof. The Company shall
provide Parent with at least forty-eight (48) hours prior notice of any
meeting of the Company Board of Directors (or such lesser notice as is
provided to the members of the Company Board of Directors) at which the
Company Board of Directors is reasonably expected to consider any Competing
Transaction. The Company shall promptly provide Parent with a list of any
non-public information concerning the Companys business, present or future
performance, financial condition or results of operations, provided in
connection with any such Competing Transaction, and, to the extent such
information has not been previously provided to Parent, copies of such
information 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 5.7(d)_, the Company Board of Directors shall prior to recommending, approving or consummating a Superior Competing Transaction, give Parent the opportunity to meet with the Company and its outside counsel and Company Financial Advisor for the purpose of enabling Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, to negotiate in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Competing Transaction ceases to constitute a Superior Competing Transaction. 

   

 (f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.7_ or any other provision hereof shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party that is consistent with its obligations hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor the Company Board of Directors may either, except as provided by _Section 5.7(c)_, (i) modify, or propose publicly to modify, in a manner adverse to Parent and Merger Sub, the approvals or recommendations of the Company Board of Directors of the Merger or this Agreement and the "agreement of merger" (as such term is used in Section 251 of the DGCL) contained herein, or (ii) approve or recommend a Competing Transaction, or propose publicly to approve or recommend a Competing Transaction. 

   

 (g) Nothing in this _Section 5.7_ shall permit the Company to terminate this Agreement (except as expressly provided in _Article VII_). 

   

 Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such public statement as may be required by Law or Order or the applicable rules of Nasdaq or NYSE, as applicable, or any listing agreement if it has used its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party and to obtain such partys consent but has been unable to do so prior to the time such press release or public statement is so required to be issued or made. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 5.9 _Litigation_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the LLC and the Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging, or seeking damages or other relief as a result of, the Merger, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, including seeking to have any Order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents entered by any court or other Governmental Entity promptly vacated or reversed. 

  

 Section 5.10 _Employee Benefit Matters_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and provide for payment of all accrued obligations and benefits existing as of the Effective Time under all Company Benefit Plans and set forth, and identified as such, in the Company Disclosure Letter (including, without limitation, employment or severance agreements between the Company and Persons who are or had been of the Company at or prior to the Effective Time), all in accordance with their respective terms and shall provide the employees of the Company who remain employed immediately after the Effective Time with types and levels of compensation and benefits that are commensurate in all material respects with the compensation and benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent. 

   

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall transfer all eligible assets and Liabilities from the defined contribution retirement plan that Company maintained immediately prior to the Effective Time, to a qualified defined contribution retirement plan maintained by Parent, with respect to the Company Employees in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any such transfer shall be in an amount sufficient to satisfy Section 414(l) of the Code. 

   

 (c) With respect to any Parent Employee Benefit Plan in which any Company Employees will participate effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Interim Surviving Corporation or the Final Surviving Entity, as the case may be, to, recognize all service of the Company Employees with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, for vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for (i) purposes of early retirement subsidies under any Parent Employee Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan or (ii) benefit accrual purposes, except for vacation, if applicable) in any Parent Employee Benefit Plan in which such Company Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time; provided, that, such service shall not be recognized to the extent that (x) such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or (y) such service was not recognized under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan. All eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any Parent Benefit Plan that is a group health plan shall be waived with respect to such Company Employees and their eligible dependents, in each case, to the same extent as service with the Company was taken into account under the comparable Company Benefit Plan, and credit shall be provided for any co-payments, deductibles and offsets (or similar payments) made under Company Benefit Plans for the applicable plan year prior to the Effective Time for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket or similar requirements under any Parent Benefit Plans in which they become eligible to participate after the Effective Time. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) This _Section 5.10_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 5.10_, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 5.10_. Nothing contained herein, express or implied (i) shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement or (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of the Final Surviving Entity, the Interim Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this _Section 5.10_ shall not create any right in any Company Employee or any other Person to any continued employment with the Final Surviving Entity, the Interim Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, from and after the Effective Time, the Interim Surviving Corporation or the Final Surviving Entity, as the case may be, will have sole discretion over the hiring, promotion, retention, firing and other terms and conditions of the employment of the employees of the Interim Surviving Corporation or the Final Surviving Entity, as applicable. 

   

 (e) With respect to matters described in this _Section 5.10_, the Company will not send any written notices or other written communication materials to Company Employees without the prior written consent of Parent. 

   

 Section 5.11 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Interim Surviving Corporation, and from and after the LLC Effective Time, the Final Surviving Entity, shall indemnify and hold harmless all past and present officers and directors of the Company to the same extent and in the same manner such persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and its directors and officers as of the date hereof, and, to the extent applicable, the DGCL, the LLC Act, the Company Certificate of Incorporation, the Company By-laws, the Certificate of Formation and the Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Final Surviving Entity for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time or the LLC Effective Time, as the case may be, and the Parent shall guarantee such performance by the Interim Surviving Corporation and the Final Surviving Entity. The Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws of the Interim Surviving Corporation, and the Certificate of Formation and the Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Final Surviving Entity will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the indemnified parties as those contained in the Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company By-laws as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company, unless such a modification is required by Law. 

   

 (b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Interim Surviving Corporation and the Final Surviving Entity, as the case may be, to maintain in effect (or Parent may instead elect to maintain pursuant to Parents policy or policies) for the benefit of the Companys current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy 

     ##### 

  

    

that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time that is substantially equivalent to the Companys existing policy on
terms with respect to coverage in the aggregate no less favorable than those
of such policy in effect on the date hereof, or, if substantially equivalent
insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided,
however, that in lieu of the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, Parent
may request that the Company obtain, and upon such request the Company agrees
to obtain, in consultation with Parent, "tail" insurance policies as of the
Effective Time with a claims period of six years from the Effective Time with
at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions
that are not less advantageous to the Companys current directors and
officers. 

   

 (c) This _Section 5.11_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is intended to benefit the Company, the Interim Surviving Corporation and each indemnified party, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Interim Surviving Corporation and Parent, and shall be enforceable by the indemnified parties. The provisions of this _Section 5.11_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs, and his or her representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. 

   

 Section 5.12 _Exchange Matters_. Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to authorize for listing on NYSE the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Merger, and Parent and the Company shall give all notices and make all filings with the NYSE and Nasdaq required in connection with the transactions contemplated herein. 

  

 Section 5.13 _Treatment as Reorganization_. Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and LLC shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Integrated Merger to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, including by not taking any action that such party knows is reasonably likely to prevent such qualification. To the extent permitted by applicable Tax laws, each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and LLC will report the Integrated Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the treatment of the Integrated Merger as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

 Section 5.14 _Section 16 Matters_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Common Shares resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any acquisitions of Parent Common Stock resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who may be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

    ##### 

  

     

 Section 5.15 _Further Assurances_.
