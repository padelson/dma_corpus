(vii) THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of September 19, 2008 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is entered into by and among Constellation Energy Group, Inc.,
a Maryland corporation (the " _Company_ "), MidAmerican Energy Holdings
Company, an Iowa corporation (the " _Parent_ "), and MEHC Merger Sub Inc., a
Maryland corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the " _Merger
Sub_ ").

WHEREAS, the Company and the Parent have determined that it would be in each
of their best interests and in the best interests of their respective
shareholders, to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of Directors of the
Company, the Parent and the Merger Sub have approved this Agreement and the
merger of the Merger Sub with and into the Company whereby the Company will
become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent (the " _Merger_ "); and

WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the parties hereto shall enter into a Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
Purchase Agreement (the " _Securities Purchase Agreement_ ") and an Investor
Rights Agreement (the " _IRA_ " and, collectively with the Securities Purchase
Agreement, the " _Purchase Agreement_ ").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto,
intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

ARTICLE I.

THE MERGER

Section 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), the Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the laws of
the State of Maryland and the separate existence of the Merger Sub shall
cease. The Company shall be the Surviving Corporation (as defined below) in
the Merger, shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State
of Maryland and, following the Effective Time, the Company shall become a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent and shall succeed to and assume all of
the rights and obligations of the Merger Sub in accordance with the Maryland
General Corporation Law, as amended (the " _MGCL_ "). The effects and
consequences of the Merger shall be as set forth in Section 1.2. The surviving
corporation after the Merger is sometimes referred to herein as the "
_Surviving Corporation_."

Section 1.2. _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, (a) the charter
of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall at the
Effective Time be amended in its entirety to be the same as charter of the
Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that
the name of the corporation shall be "Constellation Energy Group, Inc.", and
as so amended in its entirety shall be set forth on Attachment A to the
Articles of Merger (as defined below) and shall be the charter of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter duly amended and (b) the Merger shall
have all of the effects provided by the MGCL.    As of the Effective Time, each of the directors of the Company shall resign
and the directors of the Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and
after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until
their successors have been duly elected and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the MGCL and the charter of
the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.3. _Effective Time of the Merger_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 3.1), articles of
merger in a form mutually agreed by the parties (the " _Articles of Merger_ ")
shall be executed and filed by the Company and the Merger Sub with the State
Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (" _SDAT_ ") pursuant to
the MGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Articles of
Merger with, and the acceptance of the Articles of Merger for record by, the
SDAT or upon the effective time specified in Articles of Merger so filed,
whichever is later (the " _Effective Time_ ").

ARTICLE II.

TREATMENT OF SHARES

Section 2.1. _Effect on Stock of the Company and the Merger Sub_. As of the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any holder of any of the capital stock of the Company or the Merger Sub: 

(a) _Conversion of Stock of the Company_. Each share of common stock, without
par value, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common
Stock to be treated in accordance with Section 2.1(b)), shall be converted
into the right to receive cash in the amount of $26.50 per share (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), payable, without interest, to the holder of such
share of Company Common Stock, upon surrender, in accordance with Section 2.3
hereof, of the certificate formerly representing such share.

(b) _Treatment of Certain Shares of Company Common Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned by the Parent or by any wholly owned
Subsidiary (as defined in Section 4.1) of the Company or the Parent, in each
case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall remain outstanding and
shall become that number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation that bears the same ratio to the aggregate number of outstanding
shares of the Surviving Corporation as the number of shares of Company Common
Stock held by such entity bore to the aggregate number of outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) _Stock of the Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one share of the Surviving Corporation,
which shall thereafter (together with the shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation issued in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) constitute all
of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation. No capital stock of the Merger Sub will be issued or used in the
Merger.



 

\- 2 - Section 2.2. _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Deposit with Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall
designate a bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to
the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger to receive the
funds to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall become entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1(a). Such funds shall be deposited with the Paying
Agent by the Parent immediately prior to or after the Effective Time and shall
be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Parent; provided that, no
investment of such deposited funds shall relieve the Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent from promptly making the payments required by
this Article II, and following any losses from any such investment, the Parent
shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit
of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time in the
amount of such losses, which additional funds will be held and disbursed in
the same manner as funds initially deposited with the Paying Agent for
payment of the Merger Consideration to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") which as of the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Cancelled
Shares_ ") that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1: (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ ") to the Paying Agent and such other provisions upon which the
Parent and the Company may agree) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares
to the Paying Agent for cancellation (or to such other agent or agents as may
be appointed by mutual agreement of the Parent and the Company),
together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents
as the Paying Agent may require, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration (after giving
effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.4) in
exchange for each share of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Cancelled Shares which is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be delivered to a transferee if
the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares
representing such Cancelled Shares is presented to the Paying Agent
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
by evidence satisfactory to the Paying Agent that any applicable Transfer
Taxes (as defined in Section 7.13) have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) and Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2. No interest shall be
paid or will accrue on the Merger Consideration payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article
II.



 

\- 3 - (c) _Closing of Transfer Books; Rights of Holders of Company Common Stock_.
From and after the Effective Time, the Company Common Stock transfer books
shall be closed and no registration of any transfer of such stock shall
thereafter be made on the records of the Company. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration, as provided in this Section 2.2. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares of Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided herein or by
any applicable domestic or foreign laws, statutes, ordinances, rules
(including rules of common law), regulations, codes, executive orders or
legally enforceable requirements enacted, issued, adopted, promulgated or
applied by any Governmental Authority (each, a " _Law_ ").

(d) _Termination of Paying Agent_. At any time commencing six months after the
Effective Time, the Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock (including, without
limitation, all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in
respect of all funds made available to it), and thereafter such holders shall
be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat and other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof
with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder of a share of Company Common Stock for any Merger
Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a public official pursuant
to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of

and without any payment therefor except as otherwise provided in this Section
2.3, of all Company Employee Stock Options (as defined in Section 4.3(a))
(whether or not then exercisable) on Company Common Stock outstanding at the
Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, each such Company Employee Stock
Option (whether vested or unvested) shall be cancelled (and to the extent
formerly so exercisable shall no longer be exercisable) and shall entitle
each holder thereof, in cancellation and settlement therefor, to receive a
payment, if any, in cash from the Company (less any applicable withholding
taxes), promptly following the Effective Time, equal to (i) the amount, if
any, by which the Merger

Company Employee Stock Options, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares
of Company Common Stock then issuable upon the exercise of such Company
Employee Stock Options (whether or not then vested or exercisable).

outstanding immediately before the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time,
each such Company Award shall be cancelled and shall entitle each holder
thereof, in cancellation and settlement therefor, to receive a payment in cash
from the Company (less any applicable withholding taxes), promptly following
the Effective Time, equal to (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii)
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that would be issuable upon
full vesting of such award or for which restrictions would lapse upon full
vesting of such award; provided, that, notwithstanding anything in
this sentence to the contrary, in the case of Company Performance Units, each
outstanding Company Performance Unit that becomes vested at the Effective Time
pursuant to the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan (based upon the
number of months from the start of the applicable performance period to the
Effective Time) shall immediately vest at the Effective Time, with the holder
of each such Company Performance Unit becoming entitled to receive, in full
satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect to such award
(including any portion that remains unvested), an amount in cash equal to
$2.00 (provided that (A) amounts payable pursuant to the cancellation of all
outstanding Company Performance Units pursuant to this sentence shall be paid
out within 30 days after the Effective Time without interest and (B) each

of Directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions, including obtaining consents and acknowledgements of
participants, which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of Section

actions to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither the Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Company Common Stock

settlement of Company Employee Stock Options or Company Awards. The Company
shall also take all action reasonably necessary to approve the disposition of
the Company Employee Stock Options or Company Awards in accordance with this
Section 2.3 so as to exempt such dispositions under Rule 16b-3 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ").

Section 2.4. _Withholding Rights_. Other than in respect of Transfer Taxes,
which shall be governed by Section 7.13, each of the Surviving Corporation,
the Company, the Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Merger Consideration or  



 

\- 5 -  other payments made pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock, Company Employee Stock Options or Company Awards or

Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax (as defined in Section 4.9) Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Surviving Corporation, the Company, the Parent or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Company Common Stock, Company Employee Stock Options or Company Awards or
other Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Surviving Corporation, the Company, the Parent or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any
natural person, corporation, general or limited partnership, limited
liability company, joint venture, trust, association or entity of any kind.

Company, any Company Subsidiary or Company Joint Venture has any material
liability with respect to any misclassification of any Person as an
independent contractor rather than as an employee. Since January 1, 2005, each

changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of
2001 or has remaining a period of time under the Code or applicable Treasury
Regulations or Internal Revenue Service pronouncements in which to request,
and make any amendments necessary to obtain, such a letter from the Internal
Revenue Service; and the Company is not aware of any circumstances likely to
result in the loss of the qualification of such Company Plan under Section
401(a) of the Code.

(h) _Plan Amendments_. There has been no amendment to, announcement by the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Joint Venture relating to, or
change in employee participation or coverage under, any Company Plan which
would increase materially the expense of maintaining such plan above the level

of the Company or increase the benefits (whether retroactively or
prospectively) payable under any Company Plan (except as required by
applicable law).

(i) _Claims_. There are no material pending, or to the knowledge of the
Company threatened, material claims by or on behalf of any Company Plan, by

Section 4.13. _Operations of Nuclear Power Plants._ The operations of the
nuclear generation stations owned or operated, in whole or part, by the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of the Company Joint Ventures,
as applicable (collectively, the " _Company Nuclear Facilities_ ") are and
have been conducted in compliance with all applicable Laws and Permits, except
for such failures to comply that, individually or in the aggregate, have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Each of the Company Nuclear Facilities maintains, and is in material
compliance with, emergency plans designed to respond to an unplanned Release
(as defined in Section 4.15(i)(iv)) therefrom of radioactive materials and
each such plan conforms with the requirements of applicable Law in all
material respects. The plans for the decommissioning of each of the Company

requirements of applicable Law in all material respects and, solely with
respect to the portion of the Company Nuclear Facilities owned, directly or

consistent with applicable Law. The operations of the Company Nuclear
Facilities are not the subject of any outstanding notices of violation

Guidelines_ "), and the Companys Board of Directors has approved VaR (as
defined below) limits as set forth in Section 4.14 of the Company Disclosure
Letter (the " _Company Approved VaR Limit_ "). Compliance with the Company
Trading Guidelines is monitored by the Senior Vice President and Chief Risk
Officer of the Company and is periodically reviewed with the audit committee
of the Board of Directors of the Company. The Company has provided the Company
Trading Guidelines to the Parent prior to the date of this Agreement. As

loss in the trading portfolio of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and

Section 7.1(b) shall not, and shall not be deemed to, cure any breach of any
representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter at or prior to
the date of this Agreement or affect any of the closing conditions or
otherwise limit or affect the remedies available. With respect to any of the
foregoing, the Company will consult with the Parent and its Representatives so

Company, the Parent or the Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company, the Parent or the
Merger Sub which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not include any

of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Company Joint Ventures. The
Company shall not file any such document or take such action if the Parent has
reasonably objected (and not withdrawn its objection) to the filing of such
document or the taking of such action on the grounds that such filing or
action would reasonably be expected to either (i) prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
or (ii) cause a condition set forth in Article VIII to not be satisfied in a
timely manner. The Company shall not consent to any voluntary extension of any
statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest
of any Governmental Authority without the consent of the Parent.

of the Company, the Company Joint Ventures) to any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

with copies of all filings made by any of the Company, the Parent or any of
their Subsidiaries with any federal or state court, administrative agency,

and the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company and the Parent each
shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion

and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall
give the Parent prompt notice of any change that would reasonably be expected
to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(d) In the event any claim, action, suit, investigation, legal or
administrative proceeding is commenced by any Governmental Authority or
Person (other than to the Company, the Parent or any of their Subsidiaries or
the Joint Ventures) that questions the validity or legality of this Agreement,
or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or claims damages in connection therewith, the Company and the Parent each

discretion, in each case taken (or committed (whether or not legally
committed) to be taken) after the date hereof, (ii) capital expenditures
constituting Regulatory Actions of the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Company
Joint Ventures, the Parent and its Subsidiaries that when combined with
rate reductions of the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Company Joint
Ventures, in each case made or committed (whether or not legally committed) to
be made after the date hereof exceed in the aggregate an amount acceptable to
the Parent in its reasonable discretion (iii) rate reductions of the Company,
its Subsidiaries and the Company Joint Ventures that when combined with
capital expenditures constituting Regulatory Actions of such Persons or of the
Parent and its Subsidiaries, in each case made or committed (whether or not
legally committed) to be made after the date hereof in the aggregate exceed an
amount acceptable to the Parent in its reasonable discretion.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Parent and the
Merger Sub shall not be required to cause Parent or any Affiliate of
Parent or any director, officer, employee, general partner, limited partner,
member or manager of Parent any other Affiliate of the Parent, in each case in
his, her or its individual capacity, to either (A) take any action, or
undertake the divestiture of any asset, property or company or (B) restrict
in any more than a de minimis respect the ability of Parent or any Affiliate
of Parent to exercise its rights of ownership with respect to its investment
in the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries, other than
Permitted Actions, and actions to provide responsive information required to
make any submission or application to a Governmental Authority and to
otherwise cooperate in connection with any such submission or application as
is necessary and customary under the circumstances. Without the prior written
consent of the Parent (which may be given or withheld in its sole discretion),
the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary and Company Joint
Venture to, refrain from taking (or committing (whether or not legally
committed) to take) any Regulatory Action that is not a Permitted Action and
none of the Parent or its Subsidiaries shall be obligated to take (or commit
(whether or not legally committed) to take) any Regulatory Action that is not
a Permitted Action, anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding.



 

\- 43 - Section 7.4. _Approval of the Company Shareholders_. The Company shall, as
soon as reasonably practicable, (i) take all steps necessary to duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the " _Company

7.8(e)(iii)) or has withdrawn, modified or amended the Company Board
Recommendation, and will submit this Agreement for adoption by
the shareholders of the Company at such meeting. The Company shall keep the
Parent updated with respect to the proxy solicitation results as reasonably
requested by Parent.

Section 7.5. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.

(a) _Indemnification_. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current or former director, officer,
employee or fiduciary under benefit plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(each an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_
") against (i) all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses), claims, damages or liabilities or, subject to the proviso of the
next succeeding sentence, amounts paid in settlement, arising out of actions
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) to the extent that they
are based on or arising out of the fact that such Person is or was a director,
officer, employee or fiduciary under benefit plans (the " _Indemnified
Liabilities_ "), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities to the extent they are
based on or arise out of or pertain to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in each case only to the extent such Person has a right to
indemnification from the Company or the Company Subsidiaries immediately
before the Effective Time. In the event of any such loss, expense, claim,
damage or liability (whether or not asserted before the Effective Time), (i)
the Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, promptly after statements therefor
are received and otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request,
reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred, in either case to
the extent not prohibited by the business corporation Law of the Surviving
Corporations state of incorporation, (ii) the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and
(iii) any determination required to be made with respect to whether an
Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards set forth under the
business corporation Law of the  



 

\- 44 -  Surviving Corporations state of incorporation and the articles of
incorporation or by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall be made by
independent counsel mutually acceptable to the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not
be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). The Indemnified Parties as a
group may retain only one law firm with respect to each related matter except
to the extent there is, in the opinion of counsel to an Indemnified Party,
under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any
significant issue between positions of such Indemnified Party and any other
Indemnified Party or Indemnified Parties.

(b) _Insurance_. The Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation either (i)
to maintain in effect for the six-year period commencing immediately after the
Effective Time (and for so long thereafter as any claims brought before the
end of such six-year period thereunder are being adjudicated) the Companys
current directors and officers liability insurance (the " _Existing D andO
Coverage_") covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time with respect to those individuals who are as of the date hereof (and any
additional individuals who prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms with
respect to such coverage, and in amount, no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries thereof than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof
(or the Parent may cause the Surviving Corporation to substitute therefor
policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at least the same coverage with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time); provided that if
the aggregate annual premiums for such insurance shall exceed 150% of
the aggregate annual premiums paid by the Company as of the date hereof, then
the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide or cause to be
provided a policy for the applicable individuals with the best coverage as
shall then be available at an annual premium of 150% of the current aggregate
annual premium or (ii) to purchase a six-year extended reporting period
endorsement ("reporting tail coverage") under the Existing DandO Coverage,
provided that such reporting tail coverage shall extend the director and
officer liability coverage in force as of the date hereof from the Effective
Time on terms, that in all material respects, are no less advantageous to the
intended beneficiaries thereof than the existing directors and officers
liability insurance.

(c) _Successors_. In the event the Surviving Corporation, the Parent or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in either such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors, assigns and/or
transferees of the Surviving Corporation or the Parent shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.5; provided that this Section 7.5(c)
shall no longer apply to the Parent if reporting tail coverage meeting the
requirements of Section 7.5(b) shall have been purchased by the
Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Survival of Indemnification_. To the fullest extent permitted by Law,
from and after the Effective Time, all rights to indemnification as of the
date hereof in favor of the employees, agents, directors and officers of the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries with respect to their activities as such
prior to, on or after the Effective Time, as provided in their respective
articles of incorporation and by-laws in effect on the date thereof, or
otherwise in  



 

\- 45 -  effect on the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect for a period of not less than six (6) years from
the Effective Time, provided that, in the event any claim or claims are
asserted or made within such survival period, all such rights to
indemnification in respect to any claim or claims shall continue until final
disposition of such claim or claims. 

(e) _Benefit_. The provisions of this Section 7.5 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs, executors or administrators and his or her representatives.

Section 7.6. _Public Announcements_. Except as may be required by Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national
securities exchange, the Company and the Parent shall consult with each other
prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public announcements
with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of the Company and the Parent will, to the extent practicable,
provide the other, reasonably in advance of its use, with drafts of any press
release or other widely disseminated presentation or other information, in
each case relating to the Merger or material corporate and financial
information relating to the Company, and give reasonable consideration to
the comments of the other thereon. In connection with the foregoing, the
Company and the Parent may share any such drafts with their respective
investors and Representatives provided that any such investors or
Representatives are bound by an obligation to maintain the confidentiality of
such information sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD
promulgated under the Securities Act. Each of the Company and the Parent will
advise the other in advance of the timing of any such press release,
presentation or other information relating to the Merger and will provide the
other with a final copy of the same simultaneously with its public release.

Section 7.7. _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

(a) _Parent Agreements_. Except as set forth below in this Section 7.7(a),
the Parent agrees that all employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries who
continue employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time (" _Affected Employees_
") will be eligible to participate in either, at the sole discretion of
Parent: (i) Parents employee benefit plans and programs, in each case to the
same extent as similarly situated employees of Parent; or (ii) such Company
Plans as are continued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following the
Closing Date, or are assumed by Parent (for the purposes of this Section 7.7
only, the plans referred to in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" of this sentence
being referred to as " _Specified Parent Benefit Plans_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring the
Parent or the Company to continue any specific plan or as preventing the
Parent or the Company from (i) establishing and, if necessary, seeking
shareholder approval to establish, any other benefit plans in respect of all
or any of the employees covered by such Specified Parent Benefit Plans or any
other employees, (ii) amending such Specified Parent Benefit Plans (or any
replacement benefit plans thereof) where required by applicable Law including,
without limitation, any amendments necessary to avoid application of Section
409A of the Code, or where such amendment is with the consent of the affected
employees or as otherwise effected in accordance with the terms of such plans,
or (iii) amending the Specified Parent Benefit Plans in the ordinary course
of business. Notwithstanding the  



 

\- 46 -  foregoing, from and after the Closing Date, the Parent shall cause the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its express
terms, each existing collective bargaining, employment, change of control,
severance and termination agreement between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and any representative union, officer, director or employee of
such company and vacation entitlements already accrued as of the Closing
Date.

(b) _Service Credit_. Subject to obligations under applicable Law and
applicable collective bargaining agreements, the Parent shall cause all
Affected Employees to be credited with all service for the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries (and all other service credited by the Company or the
Company Subsidiary or the Company Plans), under (x) all Specified Parent
Benefit Plans in which Affected Employees become eligible to participate on or
after the Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit
accrual and all other purposes (but not for purposes of benefit accrual under
defined benefit pension plans or eligibility for early retirement under
defined benefit pension plans and not to the extent crediting such service
would result in duplication of benefits). The Parent shall, and shall cause
its direct and indirect Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation), or
shall use its reasonable efforts to cause its insurance carrier, to, (i) waive
all limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions and all
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to each Affected Employee under any Specified Parent Benefit Plan
that is a welfare benefit plan in which an Affected Employee becomes eligible
to participate on or after the Effective Time, except to the extent of
limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect under the Company
Plans with respect to the Affected Employee as of the Effective Time and that
have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time and (ii) credit each
Affected Employee for any co-payments, deductibles and other out-of-pocket
expenses paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable
deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket requirements for the year in which
the Effective Time occurs under any Specified Parent Benefit Plan that is
welfare plan in which the Affected Employee participates on and after the
Effective Time. Nothing in this Section 7.7 shall be deemed to create any
third-party beneficiary or right of employment with respect to any Affected
Employee. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall constitute or be deemed to
be an amendment to any Specified Parent Benefit Plan or any other compensation
or benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Parent, Surviving Corporation,
Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(c) _Communications_. Prior to making any material written communications to
the directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or material oral communications to a group of directors,
officers or employees, pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are
affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company
shall provide the Parent with a copy of the intended communication, the Parent
shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the
communication, and the Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing
any such mutually agreeable communication.

Section 7.8. _No Solicitation_.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, except as
specifically permitted in Section 7.8(d), the Company agrees that none of
it, any of its Subsidiaries or the Company Joint Ventures nor any of the
officers or directors of the Company,  



 

\- 47 -  its Subsidiaries or the Company Joint Ventures shall, and that it shall
cause its, its Subsidiaries and its Joint Ventures Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly:

(i) initiate, solicit or encourage (including by way of providing information)
or facilitate any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, or the
making, or the completion of, a Takeover Proposal;

(ii) participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or
furnish or disclose any non-public information relating to the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of the Company Joint Ventures to, or otherwise
cooperate with or assist any Person in connection with a Takeover Proposal;

(iii) withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation in
any manner adverse to the Parent or Merger Sub;

(iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Takeover Proposal;

(v) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement relating
to a Takeover Proposal; or

(vi) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries, Joint
Ventures and Representatives to, immediately cease any existing
solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than the
parties hereto) that has made or indicated an intention to make a Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall promptly request that each Person who has executed
a confidentiality agreement with the Company in connection with such Persons
consideration of a Takeover Proposal (other than the parties hereto and their
respective advisors) return or destroy all non-public information furnished to
that Person by or on behalf of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries
or any of the Company Joint Ventures. The Company shall promptly inform its
Representatives of the Companys obligations under this Section 7.8.

(c) The Company shall notify the Parent promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) upon receipt by it, any of its Subsidiaries, Company Joint Ventures or
Representatives of (i) any Takeover Proposal or indication by any Person that
it is considering making a Takeover Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public
information relating to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
the Company Joint Ventures other than requests for information in the
ordinary course of business and unrelated to a Takeover Proposal or (iii) any
inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and in any event within
24 hours) with the identity of such Person and a copy of such Takeover
Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (or, where no such copy is available,
a description of such Takeover Proposal, indication, inquiry or request),
including any modifications thereto. The Company shall keep the Parent
reasonably informed on a current basis (and in any event within 24 hours of
the occurrence of any changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of
the status of any such Takeover Proposal, indication, inquiry or request
(including the material terms and conditions thereof and of any modification
thereto),  



 

\- 48 -  and any material developments, discussions and negotiations, including
furnishing copies of any written inquiries, correspondence and draft
documentation, and written summaries of any material oral inquiries or
discussions. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and
in any event within 24 hours) notify the Parent orally and in writing if it
determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or
negotiations concerning a Takeover Proposal pursuant to this Section 7.8(d).
The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Company Joint
Ventures not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date of this Agreement, and none of the Company, nor any of
its Subsidiaries or any of the Company Joint Ventures, is party to any
agreement, which prohibits the Company from providing such information to the
Parent. The Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and
Company Joint Ventures not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision
of any existing standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it or any of
its Subsidiaries or any Company Joint Venture is a party, and the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Company Joint Ventures to, enforce
the provisions of any such agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall have the right to, and to cause each of its Subsidiaries and
Company Joint Ventures to, waive in writing any standstill solely to the
extent required to permit such a Person to convey confidentially a Takeover
Proposal to the Board of Directors of the Company under circumstances in
which the Company is permitted under this Section 7.8 to participate in
discussions regarding a Takeover Proposal. In the event that the Company, its
Subsidiaries or the Company Joint Ventures waive any standstill provision,
the Company shall simultaneously give written notice of such waiver to the
Parent. If requested in writing by the Parent at least three (3) business days
prior to the Company Meeting, the Board of Directors of the Company
shall, prior to the Company Meeting, publicly reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation and any failure to do so shall be deemed to be a change in the
Company Board Recommendation that permits Parent to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1(g).

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be permitted, if it has
otherwise complied with its obligations under this Section 7.8, but only
prior to the Company Shareholders Approval, to:

(i) engage in discussions or negotiations with a Person who has made a
written Takeover Proposal not solicited in violation of this Section 7.8 if,
prior to taking such action, (A) the Company enters into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with such Person and (B) the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith (1) after receiving the advice of its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal and
(2) after receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel, that the failure
to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its
duties to the Company and its stockholders under applicable Laws; 

(ii) furnish or disclose any non-public information relating to the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or the Company Joint Ventures to a Person who has
made a written Takeover Proposal not solicited in violation of this Section
7.8 if, prior to taking such action, the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (A) after receiving the advice of its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes,
or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal and (B) after
receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such  



 

\- 49 -  action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its duties to the
Company and its stockholders under applicable Laws, but only so long as
the Company (x) has caused such Person to enter into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement and (y) concurrently discloses the same such non-
public information to the Parent if such non-public information has not
previously been disclosed to the Parent; and

(iii) withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation in a manner
adverse to the Parent or Merger Sub, if the Board of Directors of the Company
has determined in good faith, after receiving the advice of outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
result in a breach of its duties to the Company and its stockholders under
applicable Laws; _provided_ that prior to any such withdrawal, modification or
amendment to the Company Board Recommendation, (A) the Company shall have
given the Parent prompt written notice advising the Parent of (x) the
decision of the Board of Directors of the Company to take such action and the
reason for taking such action and (y) in the event the decision relates to a
Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of the Takeover
Proposal, including the identity of the party making such Takeover Proposal
and, if available, a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with
such party and other material documents, (B) the Company shall have given
the Parent five Business Days after delivery of each such notice to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement (or make another proposal) and shall
have negotiated in good faith with the Parent with respect to such proposed
revisions or other proposal, if any, and (C) the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have determined in good faith, after considering the results of
such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by the Parent, if
any, and after receiving the advice of outside legal counsel that the failure
to effect such withdrawal, modification or amendment of the Company Board
Recommendation would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its duties
to the Company and its stockholders under applicable Laws; _provided_ that,
in the event the Board of Directors of the Company does not make the
determination referred to in clause (C) of this paragraph but thereafter
determines to withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation
pursuant to this Section 7.8(d)(iii), the procedures referred to in clauses
(A), (B) and (C) above shall apply anew and shall also apply to any subsequent
withdrawal, amendment or modification.

This Section 7.8(d) shall not prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company
from disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act (other than
any disclosure prohibited by Section 7.8(d)); _provided_ , _however_ , that
any disclosure other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication
of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall be
deemed to be a withdrawal, modification or amendment of the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to the Parent or Merger Sub unless the
Board of Directors of the Company (x) expressly reaffirms its recommendation
to its shareholders in favor of adoption of this Agreement or, (y) rejects
such other Takeover Proposal.

determines (in its sole discretion) that, since June 30, 2008 to the date
which Parent elects to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.1(h), either the retail and/or wholesale businesses or assets of the
Company, its  



 

\- 57 -  Subsidiaries and the Company Joint Ventures taken as a whole have materially

and Section 9.3, the agreement contained in the last sentence of Section
7.1(a), and Article X shall survive the termination; provided, however, that

Company fails to promptly pay to the other any fee or expense due
under Section 9.3(a), in addition to any amounts paid or payable pursuant to
such sections, the Company shall pay the costs and expenses (including legal
fees and expenses) in connection with any action, including the filing of any
lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect payment, together with

The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under
this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Section 10.3. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Purchase Agreement
are being entered into simultaneously but are separate transactions. Except
as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the provisions of the Purchase
Agreement are not intended to, and in no way, modify or supplement the terms
of this Agreement. This Agreement (including the documents and instruments
referred to herein) together with the Confidentiality Agreement constitutes
the entire agreement and supersedes all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof.

Section 10.4. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
void or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any
other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction or other authority declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid, void or unenforceable, the parties agree that
the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration, area or applicability of the term or provision, to delete specific
words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, void or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision.

Section 10.5. _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections or Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section or Exhibit of this
Agreement, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation," if they are not already followed by such words.

Section 10.6. _Counterparts; Effect_. This Agreement may be executed by
facsimile and in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to
be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

Section 10.7.  _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as expressly provided
in Section 7.5 only, the Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree that
their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein
are solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and
subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to,
and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder, including, the right to rely upon the representations
and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further agree that the
rights of third party beneficiaries under  



 

\- 60 -  Section 7.5 shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product
of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 9.5 without
notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date. 

Section 10.8. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Maryland without giving
effect to the principles of conflicts of Law thereof.

Section 10.9. _Venue_. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court located in
and for Baltimore, Maryland in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement, (b) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court
and (c) agrees that it shall not bring any action relating to this Agreement
in any court other than a federal or state court sitting in and for
Baltimore, Maryland.

Section 10.10. _Waiver of Jury Trial and Certain Damages_. EACH PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, (A) ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND (B) WITHOUT
LIMITATION TO SECTION 9.3, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO RECEIVE DAMAGES FROM ANY
OTHER PARTY BASED ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS) OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

Section 10.11. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any party hereto
(whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other party; provided that, without the consent of the Company, the
Parent may transfer or assign (including by way of a pledge), in whole or from
time to time in part, all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
to one or more of its Affiliates or to its lenders or other financing sources
as collateral security; provided that no such transfer or assignment will
relieve the Parent of its obligations hereunder. Upon any such permitted
assignment, the references in this Agreement to the Parent shall also apply
to any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires.

Section 10.12. _Remedies_.

(a) _Damages_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all
remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this Agreement will be
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this
Agreement, at Law or in equity. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the exercise by a party to this Agreement of any one  



 

\- 61 -  remedy will not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy. The Company
agrees that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (other than
the last sentence of this Section 10.12(a)), (i) to the extent it has
incurred losses or damages in connection with this Agreement, (A) the maximum
aggregate liability of the Parent and Merger Sub for such losses or damages
shall be limited in amount to $1 billion with their recourse to the
securities issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement or upon conversion
thereof, and (B) in no event shall the Company seek to recover any money
damages other than by recourse to such securities from the Parent or Merger
Sub and (ii) in no event shall any officer, director, employee or Affiliate of
the Parent (other than Merger Sub) (each a " _Non-Recourse Party_ ") have any
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. In the event that the Company or any of its
Affiliates asserts in any litigation or otherwise that the provisions of this
Agreement limiting the maximum aggregate liability of, and recourse of such
Persons to, the Parent or Merger Sub or any of the Non-Recourse Parties as
provided in the immediately preceding clause (i) is illegal, invalid or
unenforceable in whole or in part, or asserting any theory of
liability against Parent, Merger Sub or any of the Non-Recourse Parties with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than payment
as provided in the immediately preceding clause (i) (as limited by the
provisions hereof), then the amount of the liability provided in such clause
(i) shall be automatically reduced to $1,000. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 10.12(a), in the event that any of the shares of
preferred stock to be issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement have been
redeemed or any of the notes that may be issued upon conversion of such shares
of preferred stock have been repaid or otherwise retired, the Company may
recover from the recipient of funds pursuant to such redemption, repayment or
retirement losses and damages arising from liability of Parent and/or Merger
Sub (and their respective transferees) pursuant to this Agreement up the
amount of the funds received thereupon in respect of the stated value
of shares of preferred stock or principal amount of the notes.

(b) _Specific Performance_. The parties to this Agreement agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed by the Company in accordance with their
