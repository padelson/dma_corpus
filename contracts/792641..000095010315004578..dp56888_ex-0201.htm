time is hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time._ " The Merger shall
have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the NJBCA.

  



  

1.4 _Charter and Bylaws_.

  



  

At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the certificate of incorporation of Sub in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the bylaws of Sub in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, in each case until thereafter amended in accordance with their
respective terms and the NJBCA, provided that each shall be amended to change
the name of the Company therein to "BIO-REFERENCE LABORATORIES, INC.".

  



  

1.5 _Directors and Officers_.

  



  

The directors of Sub in office immediately prior to the Effective Time
(together with such additional persons as may be appointed or elected to
become directors of the Surviving Corporation effective as of the Effective
Time), shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective
Time and shall serve in such capacity until the earlier of their resignation
or removal or until their successors are duly elected and qualified in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and the NJBCA. The
officers of Sub in office immediately prior to the Effective Time
(together with such additional persons as may be elected to become officers
of the Surviving Corporation effective as of the Effective Time) shall be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time and shall serve in
such capacity until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until
their successors are duly elected and qualified in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation and the NJBCA.

  



  

1.6 _Conversion of Shares_.

  



  

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not
limited to, the provisions of this _Article 1_ , at the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the
Company, Sub or any holder of Company Common Stock:

  



  

(a)   _Conversion of Sub Common Stock_. Each share of Sub
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation (the "
_Converted Shares_ "). The Converted Shares shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation at the
Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates
representing shares of Sub Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to
represent the Converted Shares until the board of directors of the Surviving
Corporation issues new certificates in respect of such shares.

--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b)   _Shares Held by the Company or Parent_. Each of the shares
of Company Common Stock held by any Company Entity (including shares of
Company Common Stock held in treasury by the Company) or by any Parent Entity
shall be canceled and retired at the Effective Time and no consideration
shall be issued in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c)   _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock (excluding shares cancelled pursuant to _Section
1.6(b)_) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be converted into and exchanged for the right to
receive Parent Common Stock in the ratio of 2.75 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ")
shares of Parent Common Stock for such share of Company Common Stock (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective Time, all such shares
of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (a " _Company Certificate_ ") or book-entry share (a " _Book-
Entry Share_ ") representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration therefor, without interest thereon, upon the
surrender of such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with
_Section 1.9_.

  



  

(d)   _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged
pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all
Company Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu of such fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock, one
share of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

1.7 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_.

  



  

If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into, or
exchanged for, a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of
any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, reorganization,
recapitalization, split, combination, contribution or exchange of shares, the
Merger Consideration and any payments to be made under _Section 1.6_ and any
other number or amount contained herein which is based upon the number
of shares of Company Common Stock shall be correspondingly adjusted to
provide the holders of Company Common Stock, Company Options and other awards
under the Company Option Plan, the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this _Section 1.7_ shall be
construed to permit any Party to take any action that is otherwise
prohibited or restricted by any other provision in this Agreement.

  



  

1.8 _Stock Options_.

  



  

(a)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Board shall take all
necessary actions so that each option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock granted by the Company, whether granted pursuant to the Company Option
Plan (individually, a " _Company Plan Option_ ") or otherwise (collectively,
including all Company Plan Options, the " _Company Options_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, shall be

  



    

4 
--- 

 


--- 

    

converted into and become rights with respect to Parent Common Stock, and
Parent shall assume each Company Option, in accordance with the terms of the
Company Option Plan and/or stock option agreement by which it is evidenced,
except that from and after the Effective Time, (i) Parent and its
compensation committee shall be substituted for the Company and the
compensation committee of the Board (including, if applicable, the Board)
administering such Company Option Plan, (ii) each Company Option assumed by
Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock (or cash, if
so provided under the terms of such Company Option), (iii) the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Company Options shall be equal
to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Options immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, and (iv) the per share
exercise price under each such Company Option shall be adjusted by
dividing the per share exercise price under each such Company Option by the
Exchange Ratio and rounding up to the nearest cent. In
addition, notwithstanding the provisions of clauses (iii) and (iv) of the
first sentence of this _Section 1.8(a)_, each Company Option that is an
"incentive stock option" or a nonqualified stock option held by a U.S.
taxpayer shall be adjusted as required by Section 424 of the Code and Section
409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, so as not to
constitute a modification, extension or renewal of the option, within the
meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations under
Section 409A of the Code, or otherwise result in negative Tax treatment or
penalties under Section 424 of the Code or Section 409A of the Code. Each of
the Company and Parent shall adopt any and all resolutions and take all
necessary steps to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this _Section
1.8(a)_.

  



  

(b)  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall deliver to the participants in each Company Option Plan an appropriate
notice setting forth such participant's rights pursuant thereto and the grants
subject to such Company Option Plan shall continue in effect on the same
terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by _Section
1.8(a) _after giving effect to the Merger), and Parent shall comply with the
terms of each Company Option Plan to ensure, to the extent required by, and
subject to the provisions of, such Company Option Plan, that Company Options
that qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time
continue to qualify as incentive stock options after the Effective Time and
Company Options that qualified for exemption from application of Section 409A
of the Code prior to the Effective Time continue to remain so exempt. At or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all corporate action necessary
to reserve for issuance sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery
upon exercise of Company Options assumed by it in accordance with this
_Section 1.8_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
file a registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or
any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to such options and shall use its reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding.

1.9 _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(a)  On the Closing Date, Parent shall make available to
Parent's transfer agent or another exchange agent selected by Parent and
which is reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for
exchange in accordance with this _Section 1.9_, the shares of the Parent
Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. Promptly after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall instruct the Exchange Agent to
mail (or in the case of the Depository Trust Company on behalf of " _Street_
" holders, deliver) to each holder of record of a Company Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, appropriate transmittal
materials and instructions (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to such Company Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Company
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent). Each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to
receive Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of (i) any share of Company Common Stock
represented by a Company Certificate upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of
such Company Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly executed
letter of transmittal and duly endorsed as the Exchange Agent may require or
(ii) any Book-Entry Share upon receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange
Agent, together with such other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock represented by Company
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that are not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, the consideration provided in _Section 1.6_ may be
issued to a transferee if the Company Certificates representing such shares
or Book-Entry Shares are delivered to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence such transfer and by evidence satisfactory to
the Exchange Agent that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid.
If any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed,
upon receipt of (i) an affidavit of that fact from the holder claiming such
Company Certificate to be lost, mislaid, stolen or destroyed, (ii) such bond,
security or indemnity as Parent and the Exchange Agent may reasonably require,
and (iii) any other documents necessary to evidence and effect the bona fide
exchange thereof, the Exchange Agent shall issue to such holder the
consideration into which the shares represented by such lost, stolen, mislaid
or destroyed Company Certificate shall have been converted. The
Exchange Agent may establish such other reasonable and customary rules and
procedures in connection with its duties as it may deem appropriate. Parent
shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in
connection with the distribution of the consideration provided in _Section
1.6_. No interest will accrue or be paid to any holder of Company Common
Stock.

  



  

(b)  After the Effective Time, each holder of shares of Company
Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section
1.6(b)_) shall submit a duly completed and validly executed letter of
transmittal, duly endorsed as the Exchange Agent may require (or, in the case
of Book-Entry Shares, such other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) together with (except in the case of a
holder of Book-Entry Shares) the Company Certificate or Company Certificates
representing such shares and shall promptly upon surrender thereof receive in
exchange therefor the consideration provided in _Section 1.6 _in one or more
shares of Parent Common Stock which shall be in uncertificated book

entry form unless a physical certificate is requested, together with all
undelivered dividends or distributions in respect of such shares (without
interest thereon) pursuant to _Section 1.6_. Parent shall not be obligated
to deliver the Merger Consideration to which any former holder of Company
Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder
surrenders or transfers such holder's Company Certificate or Company
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for exchange as provided in this _Section
1.9_.

  



  

(c)  Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of any state, local, or foreign Tax Law, unless they have been
presented with documentation that eliminates the requirement to withhold,
and to request any necessary Tax forms, as applicable, or any other proof of
exemption from withholding or similar information, from the shareholders of
the Company or other recipient of payments in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. Each of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall provide any
documentation of such deduction or withholding as reasonably requested by the
shareholders of the Company or other recipient of payments in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

(d)  Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Company Common Stock for one year after
the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent (together with any dividends or
earnings in respect thereof). Any holders of Company Common Stock who have
not theretofore complied with this _Article 1_ shall thereafter be entitled to
look only to Parent, and only as a general creditor thereof, for payment of
the consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common
Stock such holder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each

1.10 _Rights of Former Company Shareholders_.

  



  

At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed as to holders of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time and no transfer of Company Common Stock by any such holder
shall thereafter be made or recognized. If, after the Effective Time, Company
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing shares of Company Common Stock
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this 
_Article 1_. Until surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions
of _Section 1.9_, each Company Certificate theretofore representing shares
of Company Common Stock and each Book-Entry Share (other than shares to
be canceled pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_) shall from and after the Effective
Time represent for all purposes only the right to receive the consideration
provided in _Section 1.6_ in exchange therefor, subject, however, to
the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which have been
declared or made by the Company in respect of such shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and which remain unpaid
at the Effective Time. To the extent required by Law, former shareholders of
record of the Company shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at
any meeting of Parent stockholders the number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock into which their respective shares of Company Common Stock are
converted, regardless of whether such holders have exchanged their Company
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for Parent Common Stock in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement. Whenever a dividend or other distribution
is declared by Parent on the Parent Common Stock, the record date for which
is at or after the Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends or
other distributions on all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
this Agreement, no dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of
record of Parent Common Stock as of any time subsequent to the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the holder of any Company Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares until such holder surrenders such Company Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares for exchange as provided in _Section 1.9_. However, upon
surrender of such Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, both the Parent
Common Stock (together with all such undelivered dividends or other
distributions without interest) and any undelivered dividends and cash
payments payable hereunder (without interest) shall be delivered and paid
with respect to each share represented by such Company Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares.

obligations under any of such insurance policies. Excluding insurance
policies that have expired and been replaced in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, as of the date hereof, no threat in
writing has been made to cancel (excluding cancellation upon expiration or

any other Parent Regulatory Agency to invoke its policy with respect to
"Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities",
or similar policies, set forth in any applicable Laws, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Report filed by Parent with the SEC: (i) the Contract is in full force and

required to have been disclosed pursuant to this Agreement or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or seeking damages or
discovery in connection with such transactions. Parent shall have the right to
be consulted with respect to the defense of any such Litigation; provided,
that subject to _Section 4.15_, the Company shall retain the sole right and
complete discretion to determine its own course of conduct with respect to any
such Litigation.

  



  

(b)  The Company agrees to promptly notify Parent upon becoming
aware of any final, nonappealable decision from a court, patent office, or

value of any Intellectual Property.

  



  

4.5   _No Control of Other Party 's Business; Other Actions_.

  



  

Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give Parent the right to
control or direct any of the Company Entities' operations prior to the

complete control and supervision over their respective businesses, assets and
operations.

Parent shall prepare, together with the Company, and file with the SEC the
Registration Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall also prepare and
file with the SEC any other document, schedule or statement required to be
filed by such Party (a " _Required Filing_ "). Each of Parent and the Company
shall promptly provide to the other such information concerning its
business affairs and financial statements as is requested by the other party
and, in the reasonable judgment of the providing party or its counsel, may be
required or appropriate for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
Registration Statement and any Required Filing pursuant to this _Section
4.6_, or in any amendments or supplements thereto, and shall cause its
counsel and auditors to cooperate with the other's counsel and auditors in
the preparation of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Registration Statement and
any Required Filing. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Registration
Statement, respectively, to be filed with the SEC not later than the date that
is sixty (60) calendar days after the date hereof. Parent and the Company
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to
become effective under the Securities Act as soon after such filing as
practicable and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is
necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its shareholders as promptly as
practicable after the Registration Statement becomes effective. The Parties
shall promptly provide copies, consult with each other and cooperate in the
preparation of

  



  

   

46 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  



  

written responses with respect to any written comments received from the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement or
any Required Filing and promptly advise one another of any oral comments
received from the SEC. The Registration Statement, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and any Required Filing shall, at the time of the Company
Shareholders' Meeting comply as to form in all material respects with the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
by the SEC thereunder. The Company shall retain a proxy solicitor on terms
reasonably acceptable to Parent in connection with the solicitation of the
Required Company Vote.

  



  

(b)  Parent and the Company shall make all required filings with
respect to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, the rules of any stock exchange on which
Parent's securities or the Company's securities are listed, applicable state
securities and "blue sky" Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder
and any applicable foreign securities Laws or with any foreign securities
authorities. Each Party will advise the other, promptly (but in any event
within one (1) Business Day) after it receives notice thereof, of the time
when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of
the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement or any
Required Filing or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the
SEC for additional information. No amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement or any Required Filing shall
be filed without the approval of both Parent and the Company, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, that with
respect to documents filed by a Party which are incorporated by reference in
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement or any Required
Filing, this right of approval shall apply only with respect to information
relating to the other Party or its business, financial condition or results of
operation. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to Parent, Sub or the Company, or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent
or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement or any Required Filing,
so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
Party that discovers such information shall promptly (but in any event within
two (2) Business Days) notify the other Parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the
shareholders of the Company.

  



  

(c)  The Company shall cause the Company Shareholders' Meeting
to be duly called and held as soon as reasonably practicable after the SEC
declares the Registration Statement effective for the purpose of obtaining the
Required Company Vote. In connection with such meeting, the Company will (i)
subject to the ability of the Board to make a Change in Recommendation or
Company Intervening Event Change in Recommendation pursuant to _Section
4.7_, make the Company Board Recommendation and include such recommendation
in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (ii) subject to the ability of the Board to
make a Change in

  



  

   

47

Recommendation or Company Intervening Event Change in Recommendation pursuant
to _Section 4.7_, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Required
Company Vote and (iii) otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable
to such meeting. In the event that during the five Business Days prior to the
date that the Company Shareholders' Meeting is then scheduled to be held, the
Company delivers to Parent a notice of an intent to make a Change in
Recommendation or a Company Intervening Event Change in Recommendation, or to
enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement, in each case, to the extent
permitted by _Section 4.7_  (including in connection with a change in terms
pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 4.7(d)(i)_ ), Parent may direct the
Company to postpone the Company Shareholders' Meeting for up to ten Business
Days and the Company shall promptly, and in any event no later than the next
Business Day, postpone the Company Shareholders' Meeting in accordance with
Parent's direction. Notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation or Company
Intervening Event Change in Recommendation, the Company shall nonetheless
submit this Agreement to the Company's shareholders to obtain the Required
Company Vote at the Company Shareholders' Meeting unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Article VI_ prior to the Company Shareholders'
Meeting. For the avoidance of doubt, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, neither the commencement, proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company of any Company Acquisition Proposal
nor the making of any Change in Recommendation or Company Intervening Event
Change in Recommendation shall limit otherwise affect the obligation of the
Company to set a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Company Shareholders' Meeting in accordance with this _Section 4.6_.

  



  

(d)  Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the information supplied or to be supplied by such Party specifically
for inclusion or incorporation in the Registration Statement, at the time the
Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, does not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein not misleading. Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
ensure that the information supplied or to be supplied by such Party to the
Company specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, on the
date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is first mailed to the shareholders of the
Company, at the time of the Company Shareholders' Meeting and at the
Effective Time, does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Each Party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the information supplied or to be supplied by such
Party specifically for inclusion or incorporation in any Required Filing, at
the time any such Required Filing is filed with the SEC, does not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein not misleading.

  



  

(e)  The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and
each shall use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use)
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
this Agreement in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated

hereby as soon as practicable, including, without limitation, preparing and
filing as soon as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary
notices, reports and other filings, and all other Consents, registrations,
approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained.

  



  

4.7   _No Solicitation_.

  



  

(a)  The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit
any of its Affiliates to, and shall not authorize or permit its and its
Affiliates' respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage or otherwise take any action to facilitate
any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, the submission of any
Company Acquisition Proposal, or, (ii) subject to _Section 4.7(b)_, conduct
or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, disclose any non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or
knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by, any
third party that, to the Company's Knowledge is seeking to make, or has made,
any Company Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) subject to _Section
4.7(b)_, approve, endorse or recommend any Company Acquisition Proposal, or
(iv) subject to _Section 4.7(b)_, enter into any agreement in principle,
letter of intent, term sheet, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
Contract (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, an Acceptable NDA to the
extent permitted by _Section 4.7(b)_) relating to any Company Acquisition
Proposal (each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (v) subject to
_Section 4.7(b)_, grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill
or confidentiality agreement or any Anti-takeover Laws or otherwise fail to
enforce any of the foregoing (it being understood that the Company shall
immediately take all steps within its power necessary to terminate any waiver
that may have been heretofore granted, to any Person other than Parent or any
of Parent's Affiliates, under any such provisions), or (vi) resolve or agree
to do any of the foregoing. Subject to _Section 4.7(b)_, neither the Board
nor any committee thereof shall make, withdraw, amend, modify or materially
qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the Company Board
Recommendation, or recommend a Company Acquisition Proposal, fail to
recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer for the
shares of Company Common Stock within ten (10) Business Days after the
commencement of such offer, or make any public statement inconsistent with the
Company Board Recommendation, or resolve or agree to take any of the
foregoing actions (any of the foregoing a " _Change in Recommendation_ "). The
Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cease immediately and cause
to be terminated, and shall not authorize or permit any of its or their
Representatives to continue, any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations, if any, with any third party conducted prior to the date hereof
with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause any such third party (or its agents or advisors) in
possession of non-public information in respect of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company and its
Affiliates to return or destroy (and confirm destruction of) all such
information, subject to _Section 4.7(b)_, and shall terminate access of all
Persons (other than Parent, the Company and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives) to any "data room" with respect to any Company Acquisition
Proposal.

(b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 4.7(a)_, prior
to the receipt of the Required Company Vote, the Board, directly or
indirectly through any Representative, may, subject to _Section 4.7(c)_ and
provided that the Company has complied with _Section 4.7(a)_ with respect to
the applicable third party, (i) participate in negotiations or
discussions with such third party that has made a bona fide, unsolicited
Company Acquisition Proposal that the Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal,
and the Company, its Affiliates and its and its Affiliates' Representatives
may enter into an Acceptable NDA with such third party, (ii) furnish to such
third party information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
provided, that all material non-public information provided to such person has
previously been provided to Parent prior to or is provided to Parent
contemporaneously with the provision to such Person and (iii) grant a waiver
under a standstill agreement, but in each case referred to in the foregoing
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), (A) only if the Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (B) such third party
executes a confidentiality agreement that constitutes an Acceptable NDA.
Nothing contained in this _Section 4.7_ shall prevent the Board from
disclosing to the Company's shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9
and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a Company
Acquisition Proposal or any other disclosure required by applicable Law, if
the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's
outside legal counsel, that failure to disclose such position would result in
a violation of applicable Law. Any public disclosure by the Company relating
to a Company Acquisition Proposal (other than a "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation unless the
Board expressly publicly reaffirms its approval or recommendation of this
Agreement and the Merger in such disclosure, or in the case of a "stop, look
and listen" or similar communication, in a subsequent disclosure on or before
the earlier of (i) the last day of the ten (10) business day period under
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act and (ii) two (2) Business Days before the
Company Shareholders' Meeting.

  



  

(c)  The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours and prior to engaging in any of the actions
under _Section 4.7(b)_) of (i) any Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any
initial request for non-public information concerning the Company or any
Company Subsidiary related to, or from any Person or group who would
reasonably be expected to make a Company Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any
initial request for discussions or negotiations related to any Company
Acquisition Proposal. In such notice, the Company shall identify the third
party making, and details of the material terms and conditions of, any such
Company Acquisition Proposal, request, or inquiry and provide copies of any
written proposals, draft agreements and all draft or executed financing
commitments and related material documentation. The Company shall keep Parent
promptly informed of the status of any such Company Acquisition Proposal,
including any material changes to the timing, amount or form of
consideration, conditionality or other material terms of (or any other
material developments with respect to) any Company Acquisition
Proposal, request, or inquiry including by promptly, and in any event no
later than forty-eight (48) hours after receipt by the Company or any of its
Representatives, providing to Parent copies of any additional or revised
written

  



  

   

50 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  



  

proposals, requests, inquiries, draft agreements and all draft or executed
financing commitments and related material documentation. The Company agrees
that it and its Representatives will not enter into any agreement with any
Person subsequent to the date hereof that prohibits the Company from
providing any information or materials to Parent in accordance with, or
otherwise complying with, this _Section 4.7_.

  



  

(d)  Except as set forth in this _Section 4.7(d)_, the Board
shall not make any Change in Recommendation or enter into (or permit any
Company Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement.

  



  

(i)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement but provided that the Company shall at all times be in
compliance with _Section 4.7(a)_ , at any time prior to the receipt of the
Required Company Vote, the Board may, in response to a Superior Proposal,
make a Change in Recommendation or enter into (or permit any Company
Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement if, (i) the Board,
prior to effecting the Change in Recommendation, provides Parent five (5)
Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action,
which notice shall include a description in reasonable detail of such Superior
Proposal, (ii) the Company is and remains in compliance with this _Section
4.7_ during the five (5) Business Days following such written notice, the
Board and, if requested by Parent, its Representatives have negotiated in good
faith with Parent regarding any revisions to the terms and conditions of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger; and (iii)
at the end of the five (5) Business Day period described in the foregoing
clause (ii), the Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the
Company's outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and taking into
account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement which
Parent has proposed), that such Company Acquisition Proposal (if any)
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and the failure to make a Change
in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. Any material change to the terms, facts and circumstances
relating to the Superior Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Superior Proposal, as applicable, for purposes of this _Section 4.7_ and the
Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this
_Section 4.7(d)_, except that references to "five (5) Business Days" shall be
deemed to be references to "two (2) Business Days."

  



  

(ii)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the Required Company Vote, the
Board may make a Change in Recommendation in response to a Company Intervening
Event (a " _Company Intervening Event Change in Recommendation_ ") if the
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to make a
Company Intervening Event Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with
the Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law, provided, that: (A) Parent
shall have received written notice from the Company (a " _Company Notice of
Intervening Event Change in Recommendation_ ") of the Company's intention to
make a Company Intervening Event Change in Recommendation at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the taking of such action by the Company, which notice
shall specify the applicable Company Intervening Event in reasonable detail,
(B) during such period and prior to making a Company Intervening Event Change
in Recommendation, if requested by Parent, the Company and its
Representatives shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent and

  



  

   

51 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  



  

its Representatives regarding any revisions or adjustments proposed by
Parent to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the
Company to proceed with its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger
and not make such Company Intervening Event Change in Recommendation and (C)
the Company may make a Company Intervening Event Change in Recommendation
only if the Board, after considering in good faith any revisions or
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that Parent shall
have, prior to the expiration of the 5-Business Day period, offered in
writing in a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by the
Company, continues to determine in good faith that such Company Intervening
Event exists and that the failure to make a Company Intervening Event Change
in Recommendation would, after consultation with the Company's outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

  



  

(iii)  For purposes of this Agreement, (A) " _Company Acquisition
Proposal_ " means any unsolicited offer or proposal made by a Person or group
at any time after the date hereof that would result in such Person or group
acquiring, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership (with respect to
securities, within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of
at least fifteen percent (15%) (based on the fair market value thereof) of
the Assets of, equity interest in, or business of, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, pursuant to a merger, reorganization,

other similar transaction, including any single or multi-step transaction or
series of related transactions, in each case other than the Merger, (B) "
_Superior Proposal_ " means any Company Acquisition Proposal that if
consummated would result in a Person or group owning, directly or indirectly,

surviving entity or (y) fifty percent (50%) or more (based on the fair market
value thereof) of the Assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(including capital stock of the Company Subsidiaries), taken as a whole, that
the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors) is superior, from a financial point of view,
to this Agreement and the Merger, taking into account all financial, legal,
regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and of this Agreement
(including the relative risks of non-consummation and any changes to the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company), and (C) a " _Company
Intervening Event_ " shall mean any fact, circumstance, occurrence, event,
development, change or condition or combination thereof relating directly to
the Company, its Assets or its operations that was not known or reasonably
foreseeable to the Board as of the date of this Agreement (or if known, the
consequences or magnitude of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable)
other than (i) changes in the market price or trading volume of the shares of
Company Common Stock (however, the underlying reasons for such changes may
constitute a Company Intervening Event), (ii) the timing of any consents,
registrations, Permits or clearances required to be obtained prior to the
Effective Time by the Company or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries from any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement
and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) a Company Acquisition Proposal, or an inquiry, proposal or

exceeds any internal projections, budgets or forecasts or third-party revenue

events may constitute a Company Intervening Event), (v) matters set forth in
clauses ( _A)_ through ( _D)_ of the definition of Company Material Adverse
Effect and (vi) events set forth on _Section 4.7(d)(iii)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

the Company Subsidiaries to), subject to applicable Law, afford to Parent and
its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, during the
period prior to the Effective Time, to all its officers, employees,
properties, offices, plants and other facilities and to all books and records,
including financial statements, other financial data and monthly financial

and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries

(a)  Each Party hereto shall file or cause to be filed with (i)
the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice any notifications

or agree to make a Divestiture by the Parent, Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries may, at Parent's or the Company's option, as

4.11   _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a)  For purposes of this _Section 4.11_, (i) " _Indemnified
Person_ " shall mean any person who was, is now, or has been at any time
prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or who was serving at the request of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary as an officer or director of another corporation,
joint venture or other enterprise, and (ii) " _Proceeding_ " shall mean any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether or not such claim,
proceeding or investigation results in a formal civil or criminal litigation
or regulatory action.

  



  

(b)  From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless against any costs or
expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Proceeding, and
provide advancement of expenses to, all Indemnified Persons to the fullest

extent permitted under applicable Law and the Company Organizational
Documents, and (ii) honor the provisions regarding elimination of
liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees
and advancement of expenses contained in the Company Organizational Documents
immediately prior to the Effective Time and ensure that the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of present and former directors, officers, employees
and agents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries than are presently set
forth in the Company Organizational Documents. Any right of indemnification of
an Indemnified Person pursuant to this _Section 4.11(b) _shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified at any time until six (6) years from
the Effective Time in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of such
Indemnified Person as provided herein except as required by applicable Law.
Without limiting the foregoing, in any case in which approval by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation is required to effectuate any indemnification or
advancement of expenses, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
shall direct, at the election of the Indemnified Person, that the
determination of any such approval shall be made by independent counsel
mutually agreed upon between Parent and the Indemnified Person.

  



  

(c)  For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time,
Parent shall maintain in effect the Company's current directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each Indemnified Person
on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than
those of such policies in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided,
that Parent may substitute therefor policies of a reputable and
financially sound insurance company with the same or better credit rating as
the Parent's current insurance company, containing terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liabilities, including with respect to coverage and
amounts, no less favorable to any Indemnified Person; provided further, that
in satisfying their obligation under this _Section 4.11(c)_, Parent shall not
be obligated to pay for coverage for any 12-month period with aggregate
premiums for insurance in excess of 300% of the amount (the " _Annual Amount_
") payable by the Company for 12 months of coverage under its existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies, it being understood
and agreed that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such
coverage as may be obtained for 300% of the Annual Amount. Parent will cause
such policies to be maintained in full force and effect for their full term,
and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation. In lieu of maintaining such policies, the Surviving Corporation
may purchase, at the Effective Time, tail policies, from a reputable and
financially sound insurance company with the same or better credit rating as
the Company's current insurance company, to the current directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies maintained at such time by the Company,
which tail policies (i) will be effective for a period from the Effective
Time through and including the date six (6) years after the Effective Time
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred
prior to or at the Effective Time, and (ii) will contain coverage that is at
least as protective to such directors and officers as the coverage provided by
such existing policies; provided, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay for coverage for any 12-month period with aggregate premiums
for insurance in excess of 300% of the Annual Amount, it being understood and
agreed that the Surviving Corporation shall nevertheless be obligated to
provide such coverage as may be obtained for 300% of the Annual Amount.

(d)  Subject to applicable Law, the rights of any Indemnified
Person under this _Section 4.11_ shall be in addition to any other rights
such Indemnified Person may have under the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or any of the Company Subsidiaries under
the NJBCA or otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 4.11_ shall
survive the consummation of the Merger for a period of six (6) years and are
expressly intended to benefit, and to be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and personal representatives;
provided, that in the event that any claim or claims for indemnification set
forth in _Section 4.11_ are asserted or made within such six (6) year
period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims
shall continue until disposition of any and all such claims.

  



  

(e)  If Parent and/or Surviving Corporation, or any of their
respective successors or assigns, transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of their properties and assets to any other Person, then,
in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent and/or Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall assume the obligations of Parent and Surviving Corporation
set forth in this _Section 4.11_.

  



  

4.12   _Press Releases_.

  



  

The initial press release concerning the Agreement and the Merger shall be a
joint release and, thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in effect, none
of Parent, Sub or the Company will disseminate any press release or other
public disclosure materially related to this Agreement, the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated hereby (except for public disclosure permitted
under _Section 4.7_), without the prior consent of the other Parties hereto
provided, that nothing in this _Section 4.12_ shall be deemed to prohibit
any Party from making any disclosure that its outside legal counsel deems
required by Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable securities
exchange or Governmental Entity to which the relevant Party is subject or
submits, wherever situated, in which case the Party required to make the
release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow each
other Party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance; provided, further, that each of Parent and the
Company may make any public statement in response to specific questions by the
press, without obtaining the consent of or consulting with the other Parties
hereto, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or
financial analyst conference calls (without obtaining the consent of or
consulting with the other Parties hereto), so long as any such statements are
not inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made jointly by Parent and the Company and do not reveal material,
non-public information regarding the other Parties.

57

contemplated hereby do not and will not result in the grant of any rights to
any Person under the Company Organizational Documents or restrict or impair
the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to vote, or otherwise to
exercise the rights of a shareholder with respect to, shares of the Company
that may be directly or indirectly acquired or controlled by them.

  



  

(c)  From the date hereof through the earlier of termination of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company will not adopt, approve or
agree to adopt, a rights plan, "poison-pill" or other similar agreement or
arrangement or any anti-takeover provision in the Company Organizational
Documents that is, or at the Effective Time shall be, applicable to the
Company, the Company Common Stock, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

4.14   _Employee Benefits and Contracts_.

  



  

(a)  For the period from the Effective Time until December 31,

each employee of the Company and any Company subsidiary, base salary or wage
rate, bonus opportunity, commission opportunity, incentive compensation,
pension, welfare and fringe benefits (other than defined benefit pension
benefits and retiree medical benefits) no less favorable than the base salary
or wage rate, bonus opportunity, commission opportunity, incentive
compensation, pension, welfare and fringe benefits (other than defined
benefit pension benefits and retiree medical benefits) that are provided to
each employee pursuant to Plans on the date of this Agreement. Except to the
extent set forth in Section 4.14(d) of this Agreement, nothing herein shall

Parent from terminating (or causing the termination of) the employment of any
employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary at any time after
the Closing Date for any reason (or no reason). The provisions of this
Section 4.14 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and
nothing herein, express or implied, is intended or shall be construed to
constitute an amendment to any Plan or create any right or cause of action in
or on behalf of any Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any current
or former employees, officers, directors or consultants of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto.

  



  

(b)  With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by
Parent or its Affiliates in which any employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary becomes or is a participant, for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting, vacation, paid time-off and severance
and other benefit plan accruals (other than benefit accrual under a defined
benefit pension plan), each such employee's service with the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (as well as service with any predecessor employer, to the
extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or
Company Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Parent and its
Affiliates; provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

  



  

(c)  With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, in which any
employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary becomes or is eligible to
participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and

  



  

   

58 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  



  

exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable
to such employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were
satisfied or did not apply to such employees under welfare plans of the
Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each
such employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid and for
out-of-pocket maximums incurred prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any
analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable

(e)  Upon the Effective Time, the compensation committee of the
board of directors of Parent (or such other body that shall administer the
Parent Stock Plan or any other plan that Parent may from time to time adopt),
shall grant stock options to purchase Parent Common Stock under the Parent
Stock Plan or any other plan that Parent may from time to time adopt, with an
exercise price equal to the Fair Market Value (as such term is defined in the
Parent Stock Plan or any other plan that Parent may from time to time adopt)
of a share of Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date, (i) to those employees
of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, (ii) in such amounts and (iii) in
accordance with the vesting schedule, in each case, as set forth on _Schedule
4.14(e)_  attached hereto as such schedule may be updated by the Company
prior to the Effective Time to reallocate such stock options among employees
of the Company and Company Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the total
number of such stock options shall not be increased above the number set
forth in such schedule at the time that this Agreement is executed.

  



  

(f)  This _Section 4.14_ shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing
in this _Section 4.14_, express or implied, shall confer upon any other
Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this _Section 4.14_. Nothing contained herein, express or implied (i) shall
be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement or (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to
amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any
of them. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in
this _Section 4.14_ shall not create any right in any employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or any other Person to any continued
employment with the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

  



  

4.15   _Shareholder Litigation_.

  



  

Each of the Company and Parent shall keep the other Party hereto informed of,
and cooperate with such Party in connection with, any shareholder litigation
or claim against such Party and/or its directors or officers relating to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
that, notwithstanding any contrary provision of _Section 4.3_, no

  



  

   

59 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  



  

settlement in connection with such shareholder litigation shall be agreed to
without Parent's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

4.16   _NASDAQ; Post-Closing SEC Reports_.

  



  

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NASDAQ to enable the
delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Stock from the
NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange
Act, in each case, promptly after the Effective Time. Parent will use
reasonable efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation to file with the SEC (a)
a Form 25 on the Closing Date, or as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter, following the Closing and (b) a Form 15 on the first business day
that is at least ten (10) days after the date the Form 25 is filed (such
period between the Form 25 filing date and the Form 15 filing date, the "
_Delisting Period_ "). If the Surviving Corporation is reasonably likely to
be required to file any reports pursuant to the Exchange Act during the
Delisting Period, the Company will deliver to Parent at least five (5)
business days prior to the Closing a substantially final draft of any such
reports reasonably likely to be required to be filed during the Delisting
Period (" _Post-Closing SEC Reports_ "). The Post-Closing SEC Reports
provided by the Company pursuant to this _Section 4.16_ will (i) not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading and (ii) comply in all material respects with the provisions
of applicable Laws.

4.18   _Conduct of Parent and Sub_.

  



  

Subject to applicable Law, neither Parent nor Sub will take any action that,
or fail to take any reasonable action, for which the failure to take such
action, is intended to, or would reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, result in any condition to the Merger not being satisfied or
prevent, delay or impede the ability of Parent and Sub or the Company to
consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

4.19   _Section 16 Matters_.

  



  

The Board or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is

resolution in advance of the Effective Time providing that the disposition by
the officers and directors of the Company of Company Common Stock, Company
Options or other equity securities of the Company pursuant to the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is intended to be
exempt

  



  

   

60 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  



  

from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act and shall take
all such reasonable steps as may be required to cause such dispositions to be
so exempt. The board of directors of Parent or a committee of non-employee
directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under
the Exchange Act) shall adopt a resolution in advance of the Effective Time
providing that the receipt by the Company Insiders (as defined below) of
Parent Common Stock or other equity securities of Parent pursuant to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (to the
extent such equity securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, as
defined below) is intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3
under the Exchange Act. For purposes of this _Section 4.19_, the term "
_Company Insiders_ " means those officers and directors of the Company who are
currently subject to or will become subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act as insiders of Parent in conjunction with
the Merger, and the term " _Section 16 Information_ " means information
provided by Company that is accurate in all respects regarding Company
Insiders and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock or other Parent
equity securities to be acquired by each such Company Insider in connection
with the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

4.20   _Governance Matters_.

  



  

The Company shall take all reasonable action to cause, effective at the
Effective Time, if requested by Parent, the resignations of such directors
and officers of the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries as Parent may
request.

  



  

4.21   _SEC Reports_.

  



  

During the period prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall
each continue to timely file or furnish all forms, reports, statements,
schedules and other materials with the SEC required to be filed or furnished
pursuant to the Exchange Act or other federal or applicable foreign
securities Laws.

  



  

4.22   _Post-Closing Restructuring_.

  



  

As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall merge with and into a Delaware limited liability company
wholly owned by Parent (the " _LLC_ "), in accordance with the provisions of
the NJBCA and the Delaware Limited Liability Act, as amended (the " _DELLC
Act_ "), and with the effects provided in the NJBCA and the DELLC Act. At the
effective time of such merger, the separate corporate existence of the
Surviving Corporation shall cease, and the LLC shall continue as the
surviving entity in such merger (the " _Surviving Entity_ ") and shall be a
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and shall governed by the Laws of the State
of Delaware. From and after the effective time of such merger, the Surviving
Entity shall possess all properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Surviving Corporation, and all of the claims, obligations,
liabilities, debts and duties of the Surviving Corporation and the LLC shall
become the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the
Surviving Entity.

The obligations of Parent and Sub to effect the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby are subject to the satisfaction, or waiver
by Parent, on or prior to the Closing, of the following additional conditions:

  



  

(a)   _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in _Article 2 _ of this Agreement shall
be true and correct with such exceptions as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect
(without giving effect to any limitation indicated therein by the
words "Company Material Adverse Effect," "in all material respects," "in any
material respect," "material" or "materially" used with respect to the
Company (each, a " _Company Materiality Qualifier_ ")) when made and as of
the Closing Date, as if made at and as of such date (except those
representations and warranties that address matters only as of a particular
date, which shall be true and correct in all respects only as of such date),
provided, that the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
(i) in _Sections 2.3_ (other than the last sentence of _2.3(b)_ ),  _2.4(a)_
, _2.4(b)(i)_ , _2.4(c)(ii)_ , _2.4(d)_ , _2.23_ , _2.25_ and the first
sentence of _Sections 2.1(a)_ and _2.1(b)_ , shall be true and correct in all
respects (without giving effect to any Company Materiality Qualifier therein)
other than inaccuracies that are de minimis in the context of a transaction of
this magnitude, and (ii) in _Section 2.7(b)_ shall be true and correct in all
respects, in each of the foregoing cases, when made and as of the Closing
Date, as if made at and as of such date (except those representations and
warranties that address matters only as of a particular date, which shall be
true and correct in all respects only as of that date). Parent shall have
received a certificate of an executive officer of the Company to such effect.
For purposes of this _Section 5.2(a)_ , "de minimis" with respect to
inaccuracies in _Section 2.3_ shall mean inaccuracies involving, in the
aggregate, an amount of shares of Company Common Stock not in excess of
69,510.

  



  

(b)   _Performance of Obligations of the Company_. The Company
shall have performed in all material respects and complied in all material
respects with all agreements and covenants required to be performed or
complied with by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date;
provided that the failure to notify Parent in accordance with _Sections
4.1(c)_ , _4.4(a) _ and _4.4(b)_ shall not be deemed to be a failure to
perform or comply with such agreements and covenants unless such notice was
with respect to a fact, change, event, effect or occurrence that has had or
that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect. Parent shall have received a certificate of
an executive officer of the Company to such effect.

  



  

(c)   _Parent Tax Opinion_. Parent shall have received a
written opinion of counsel from Greenberg Traurig, P.A., in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent (the " _Parent Tax Opinion_ " and together with the
Company Tax Opinion, the " _Tax Opinions_ "), dated as of the Closing Date,
to the effect that the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering such Parent Tax Opinion,
such counsel shall be

  



  

   

63 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  



  

entitled to rely upon representations of officers of Company and Parent
reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to such counsel. If Greenberg
Traurig, P.A. does not render such opinion, this condition may be satisfied if
a nationally-recognized law firm (other than Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP)
renders such opinion, relying upon representations of officers of the Company
and Parent reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to such firm.

  



  

5.3   _Conditions to Obligations of the Company_.

  



  

The obligations of the Company to effect the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby are subject to the satisfaction of, or
waiver by the Company, on or prior to the Closing of the following additional
conditions:

  



  

(a)   _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties of Parent and Sub set forth in _Article 3_ of this Agreement shall

aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect
(without giving effect to any limitation indicated therein by the words
"Parent Material Adverse Effect," "in all material respects," "in any
material respect," "material" or "materially" used with respect to Parent or
Sub (each, a " _Parent Materiality Qualifier_ ")) when made and as of the
Closing Date, as if made at and as of such date (except those representations
and warranties that address matters only as of a particular date, which shall
be true and correct in all respects only as of such date), provided, that the
representations and warranties of Parent and Sub set forth in (i) _Sections
3.2(a)_ , _3.2(b)(i)_ , _3.4_ , _3.18_ and _3.19_ , and the first sentence of
_Sections 3.1(a)_ and _3.1(b)_ shall be true and correct in all respects

respects, in each of the foregoing cases, when made and as of the Closing

(b)   _Performance of Obligations of Parent_. Parent shall have

deemed to be a failure to perform or comply with such agreements and
covenants unless such notice was with respect to a fact, change, event,
effect or occurrence that has had or that would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The
Company shall have received a certificate of an executive officer of Parent to
such effect.

  



  

(c)   _Company Tax Opinion_. Company shall have received a
written opinion of counsel from Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, in form reasonably
satisfactory to Company (the " _Company Tax Opinion_ "), dated as of the
Closing Date, to the effect that the Merger will qualify

as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
In rendering such Company Tax Opinion, such counsel shall be entitled to rely
upon representations of officers of the Company and Parent reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to such counsel. If Davis Polk and Wardwell
LLP does not render such opinion, this condition may be satisfied if a
nationally-recognized law firm (other than Greenberg Traurig, P.A.) renders
such opinion, relying upon representations of officers of the Company and
Parent reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to such firm.

(i)  the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before
December 2, 2015 (the " _Termination Date_ "); provided that the Termination
Date shall be automatically extended for a period of ninety (90) days in the
event that the failure of the Closing to have occurred by the initial
Termination Date results primarily by the failure of any of the conditions set
forth in  _Sections 5.1(c)_, _5.1(d)_ , _5.1(e)_ or _5.1(f)_ ; and provided
further, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
6.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any

(ii)  if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall
have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently

nonappealable; provided that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_ shall have used its reasonable best efforts

Agreement; and provided, further, that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to any

(i)  the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in
any respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) is not
capable of being, or is not, cured by the Company within ninety (90) days
following receipt by the Company of written notice of such breach or failure
to perform from Parent (or, if earlier, the Termination Date), and (B) would
result in a failure of any condition set forth in _Sections  5.1_ or _5.2_ ;
provided that Parent's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 6.1(c)(i) _shall not be available if Parent or Sub is then in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements hereunder that would result in the conditions to Closing set
forth in _Sections 5.1_ or _5.3_ not being satisfied;

  



  

(ii)  (A)(i) the Board fails to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or (ii) a Change in
Recommendation or a Company Intervening Event Change in Recommendation shall

Proposal that is not with respect to a tender offer or exchange offer, and the
Board shall have failed to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation
within five (5) Business Days after Parent so requests in writing; (C)
the Company enters into a written agreement with respect to a Company
Acquisition Agreement; or (D) the Company or the Board shall have publicly

(i)  Parent or Sub shall have breached or failed to perform in
any respect any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A)
is not capable of being, or is not, cured by Parent within ninety (90) days
following receipt by Parent of written notice of such breach or failure to
perform from the Company (or, if earlier, the Termination Date), and (B)
would result in a failure of any condition set forth in  _Sections 5.1_ or
_5.3_ ; provided, that the Company's right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 6.1(d)(i)_ shall not be available if the Company
is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements hereunder that would result in the conditions to
Closing set forth in _Sections 5.1 _or _5.2_ not being satisfied;

  



  

(ii)  there is a Change in Recommendation (for the avoidance of
doubt, but not a Company Intervening Event Change in Recommendation) after
complying with _Section 4.7_; or

  



  

(iii)  the Company enters into a Company Acquisition Agreement
with respect to a Superior Proposal after complying with the requirements of
_Section 4.7_ and concurrently with such termination the Company pays to

6.2   _Effect of Termination_.

  



  

(a)  Except as provided in this _Section 6.2_, in the event of
termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in
_Section 6.1_, this Agreement (other than _Section 4.8(b)_, _4.12_ ,  _6.2_
, _6.3_ and _Article 7_ ) shall forthwith become void and there shall be no
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company or their
respective Representatives; provided, that the termination of this
Agreement shall not relieve any Party from any liability or damage (which the
parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to the reimbursement of
expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include to the extent proven the
benefit of the bargain lost by a party's stockholders (taking into
consideration relevant matters including other combination opportunities and
the time value of money), which shall be deemed in such event to be damages
of such party) as a result of any fraud or intentional and material breach
of this Agreement by any party.

  



  

(b)  If (x) Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Sections 6.1(c)(i) _or _6.1(c)(ii)(B)_  or (y) Parent or the Company shall
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Sections 6.1(b)(i)_ (provided that the
Company Shareholders' Meeting has not yet been held) or _6.1(b)(iii)_ , and,
in either case (x) or (y), at any time after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the termination of this Agreement a Company Acquisition Proposal
shall have been publicly disclosed and not publicly withdrawn, then (A) the
Company shall pay Parent the Expense Reimbursement within one (1)
Business Day after Parent's demand therefor and (B) if within twelve (12)
months after such termination, the Company enters into a Company Acquisition
Agreement or consummates a Company Acquisition Proposal, then the Company
shall pay to Parent an amount equal to $54,000,000 (the " _Company
Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of same day funds on the earlier of
the date of entry into the Company Acquisition Agreement and such
consummation.

  



  

(c)  If (x) Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Sections 6.1(c)(ii)(A)_, _(C)_ or _(D) _ or (y) the Company shall terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.1(d)(ii)_ then, in either case,
the Company shall pay to Parent (1), not later than two (2) Business Days
following such termination, an amount equal to the Company Termination Fee
and (2) the Expense Reimbursement within one (1) Business Day after Parent's
demand therefor; provided, however, that if a termination under _Section
6.1(c)(ii)(A)_ is pursuant to clause (ii) thereof because a Company
Intervening Event Change in Recommendation has occurred, then in lieu of the
Company Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to
$40,500,000 (the " _Company Intervening Event Termination Fee_ ") (and, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Expense Reimbursement). In addition, if Parent
shall terminate this Agreement in a situation where it receives the Company
Intervening Event Termination Fee and within twelve (12) months after such
termination, the Company enters into a Company Acquisition Agreement or
consummates a Company Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay to
Parent an amount equal to $13,500,000 on the earlier of the date of entry
into the Company Acquisition Agreement and such consummation. For the
elimination of doubt, this amount shall be in addition to the Company
Intervening Event Termination Fee and the Expense Reimbursement that the
Company shall pay to Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.2(c)_.

  



  

   

67

(d)  If the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 6.1(d)(iii)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company
Termination Fee concurrently with such termination and the Expense
Reimbursement within one (1) Business Day after Parent's demand therefor.

  



  

(e)  For purposes of this _Section 6.2_, (A) the term "
_Company Acquisition Proposal_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such term
in _Section 4.7(d)(ii)_, except that the reference to "fifteen
percent (15%)" in the definition of " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " shall
be deemed to be a reference to "fifty percent (50%)" and (B) the term "
_Expense Reimbursement_ " shall mean Parent's documented out-of-
pocket expenses incurred in connection with investigating, negotiating,
documenting and implementing this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby not in excess of an aggregate of $3,000,000.

  



  

(f)  All payments under this _Section 6.2_ shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated by Parent.

  



  

(g)  The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this _Section 6.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and are not a penalty, and that, without these agreements,
Parent and Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Nothing contained in this
_Section 6.2_ shall constitute or shall be deemed to constitute liquidated
damages for the intentional breach by the Company of the terms of this
Agreement or otherwise limit the rights of Parent. If the Company fails to
pay promptly any fees or expenses due pursuant to this _Section 6.2_, the
Company will also pay to Parent Parent's reasonable costs and expenses
(including legal fees and expenses) in connection with any action, including
the filing of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect payment,
together with interest on the amount of the unpaid fees or expenses under
this _Section 6.2_, accruing from its due date, at an interest rate per annum
equal to two (2) percentage points in excess of the prime commercial lending
rate quoted by The Wall Street Journal. Any change in the interest rate
hereunder resulting from a change in such prime rate will be effective at the
beginning of the date of such change in such prime rate. Under no
circumstances shall the Company be obligated to pay more than one (1) Company
Termination Fee. If Parent receives the Company Termination Fee pursuant to
_Sections 6.2(b)_, _6.2(c)_ , or _6.2(d)_ , the collection of such fee will
be the sole and exclusive remedy (other than receipt of the Expense
Reimbursement) of Parent and Sub in respect of (i) any breach of, or
inaccuracy contained in the Company's covenants, agreements, representations
or warranties in this Agreement, (ii) any loss suffered as a result of the
failure of the Merger to be consummated and (iii) any other losses, damages,
obligations or liabilities suffered as a result of or under this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby. Upon payment of the Company Termination
Fee in accordance with this _Section 6.2_, none of the Company, or any of
its shareholders, directors, Affiliates, officers or agents shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising under this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby (other than with respect to the
payment of the Expense Reimbursement, if such Expense Reimbursement has not
yet been paid).

  



  

6.3   _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, including
as set forth in _Section 6.2_, all Expenses shall be borne by the Party
incurring such Expenses, it being understood and agreed that the fee payable
under the HSR Act shall be borne equally by Parent
