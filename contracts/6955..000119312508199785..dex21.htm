after the Effective Time), an amount equal to the Per Share Closing
Amount, minus (B) the Merger Option Exercise Amount with respect to such
Merger Option, plus (C) subject to the terms of _Section 2.4_, the Per Share
Additional Amount, if any, plus (D) subject to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, a conditional amount of cash equal to the Per Share Escrow Amount
of any amounts payable to the Stockholders from the Escrow Fund pursuant to
the terms of the Escrow Agreement; and

(e) each authorized but unissued share of Company Common Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled.

2.2 _Delivery of Funds; Surrender of Certificates_.

the Merger Options, as applicable, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, promptly (i) pay out to an account designated by the Stockholders
Representative, for the account of the Stockholders, at or after the
Effective Time by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount
representing the Stockholder Closing Consideration and (ii) pay to the Company
the portion of Closing Consideration payable to Option Holders less the Option
Holdback Amount, which amount shall be paid to the Option Holders through the
Companys or its Subsidiarys internal or third-party payroll processing
system subject to applicable withholding (in accordance with _Section
2.2(c)_) on the entire amount of the Closing Consideration (including the
Option Holdback Amount) payable to the Option Holders. Shares of Company
Common Stock represented by the Certificate or any Merger Options so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
 



 

-6-  on any amount due pursuant to this _Section 2.2(a)_ except as specifically
provided in the Escrow Agreement. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.2_ and the Certificate of Merger, each Certificate and each Merger
Option shall be deemed, at and after the Effective Time, to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender cash and/or securities as
contemplated by this _ARTICLE II_ , the Certificate of Merger and the DGCL.

(b) At the Effective Time, Buyer shall deliver the Escrow Amount by wire

required by applicable Laws and to appropriately reduce the Closing
Consideration payable to any Stockholders by the amount of any withholdings
or payments that are required to be made by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation
on behalf of such Stockholders (including, without limitation, withholding
obligations of the Company arising with respect to any Merger Options). To
the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be paid
over to the appropriate taxing authority and treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Stockholder in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Sections 2.1(c)_ and  _2.1(d)_ above,
the Buyer, the Company and the Stockholders Representative hereby acknowledge
and agree that the portion of the Closing Consideration to be received by
Dennis C. Wolf pursuant to _Sections 2.1(c)_ and _2.1(d)_  shall be reduced
by the Wolf Indebtedness Amount and as of the Effective Time the Wolf Note
shall be deemed to be satisfied and cancelled and Mr. Wolf shall have no
further obligations with respect thereto. Such amount shall be treated for
all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid in full to Mr. Wolf as
a portion of the aggregate Per Share Closing Amount he would otherwise be
entitled to.

2.3 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_.

(a) The consideration paid in respect of the surrender of Certificates in
accordance with the provisions of this _ARTICLE II_ and the Certificate of
Merger shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. At and after the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed
with respect to the capital stock of the Company, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of the Company Common Stock thereafter on
the records of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time,
certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this _ARTICLE II_ and the Certificate of Merger.

(b) None of the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall
be liable to any Person in respect of any amount properly delivered to a

-7- 2.4 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

(a) Three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Stockholders
Representative shall deliver to the Buyer a certificate signed by
the Stockholders Representative setting forth the Companys best estimate of
the (i) Transaction Costs (" _Estimated Transaction Costs_ "), (ii) Funded
Indebtedness (" _Estimated Funded Indebtedness_ "), (iii) Closing Cash ("
_Estimated Closing Cash_ "), (iv) Closing Date Working Capital, which shall be
prepared in accordance with Schedule 2.4(a) (the "Estimated Closing Date
Working Capital"), (v) the amount, if any, by which Estimated Closing Date
Working Capital is greater than $21,300,000 (the amount of such excess shall
be referred to herein as the " _Estimated Underpayment Amount_ "), and (vi)
the amount, if any, by which Estimated Closing Date Working Capital is less
than $20,300,000 (the amount of such shortfall shall be referred to herein as
the " _Estimated Overpayment Amount_ "). The Buyer and the Stockholders
Representative shall discuss the items set forth in such certificate
including such calculation of the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital and
the Stockholders Representative shall incorporate reasonable input from the
Buyer into the determination of the Estimated Closing Consideration.

(b) _Preparation of Closing Balance Sheet_. As promptly as practicable
following the Closing Date (but in no event later than sixty (60) days after
the Closing Date), the Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, prepare a consolidated balance sheet (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") of
the Company reflecting the financial position of the Acquired Entities
immediately prior to the Closing Date and a statement (the " _Final Closing
Date Working Capital Statement_ ") setting forth the computation of the Final
Closing Date Working Capital derived therefrom, which shall be prepared in
accordance with _Schedule 2.4(a)_ , the Transaction Costs, the Closing Cash
and the Funded Indebtedness, each as of on the Closing Date, and shall set
forth the Buyers proposed adjustment, if any, of the Closing Consideration
as contemplated by _Section 2.4(d)_ (the " _Notice of Adjustment_ ").

(c) _Review by the Stockholders  Representative_.

(i) The Buyer shall (A) provide the Stockholders Representative and
its advisors with reasonable access to the personnel, work papers, trial
balances, relevant books and records and similar materials used, and (B) give
the Stockholders Representative reasonable advance notice of, and permit
the Stockholders Representative and its advisors to observe, any physical
inventory conducted, in connection with the preparation of the Final Closing
Date Working Capital Statement.

(ii) Following receipt of the Notice of Adjustment, the Stockholders
Representative (and its advisors) will be afforded a period of twenty (20)
Business Days (the " _20-Day Period_ ") to review the Notice of Adjustment. At
the end of the 20-Day Period, the Stockholders Representative will be deemed
to have accepted the Final Closing Date Working Capital, Funded Indebtedness,
Closing Cash and Transaction Costs (as set forth in the Notice of Adjustment)
in its entirety, in which case such amounts will be as set forth in the Notice
of Adjustment unless prior to the end of the 20-Day Period the Stockholders
Representative delivers to the Buyer a written notice (the " _Objection
Notice_ ") containing a written explanation of those items set forth in the
Notice of Adjustment which the Stockholders Representative disputes and the
proposed  



 

-8-  dollar amount for each item in dispute, in which case the items identified
by the Stockholders Representative shall be deemed to be in dispute. If
the Stockholders Representative delivers the Objection Notice in a timely
manner, then (i) to the extent that any amounts contained in the Notice of
Adjustment are not disputed by the Stockholders Representative, the Parties
shall make a determination of the Final Closing Date Working Capital, Funded
Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Costs without taking into account
any such dispute (the " _Undisputed Working Capital_ "), and the Company or
the Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders), as the case
may be, shall make a payment in accordance with _Section 2.4(d) _as if the
Undisputed Working Capital, Funded Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction
Costs were as finally determined, and (ii) within a further period of twenty
(20) Business Days commencing on the date following the termination of the
20-Day Period, the Parties and, if agreed to by the Buyer and the
Stockholders Representative, their accountants will attempt to resolve in
good faith any disputed amounts, and only such disputed amounts, and reach a
written agreement (the " _Settlement Agreement_ ") with respect thereto, in
which case, the Final Closing Date Working Capital, Funded Indebtedness,
Closing Cash and Transaction Costs shall be as set forth in the Settlement
Agreement. Failing such resolution, the unresolved disputed amounts will be
referred for final binding resolution to Deloitte LLP (or, in the event
Deloitte LLP is unable or unwilling to serve, or, prior to the engagement
thereof, if it is reasonably determined by a Party that Deloitte LLP has a
conflict of interest, then an independent United States accounting or dispute
resolution firm of recognized national standing, as may be mutually selected
by Buyer and the Stockholders Representative) (the " _Arbitrating
Accountants_ "), the fees and expenses of which shall be borne as
provided below. In such case, the Final Closing Date Working Capital, Funded
Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Costs will be deemed to be as
determined by the Arbitrating Accountants. Such determination (the "
_Accountants  Determination_") shall be (A) made solely in reliance upon
supporting documentation provided to the Arbitrating Accountants by the Buyer
or the Stockholders Representative within twenty (20) days of submission of
the unresolved disputed amounts to the Arbitrating Accountants, (B) in
writing, (C) furnished to the Stockholders Representative and Buyer as soon
as practicable after the items in dispute have been referred to the
Arbitrating Accountants, (D) made in accordance with _Schedule 2.4(b)_ , (E)
no more favorable to Buyer than is set forth in the Notice of Adjustment and
no more favorable to the Stockholders than is set forth in the Objection
Notice, and (F) absent manifest error, nonappealable and incontestable by the
Stockholders Representative, the Stockholders, the Company, the Buyer and
each of their respective Affiliates and successors and not subject to
collateral attack for any reason. The fees and expenses of the Arbitrating
Accountants shall be paid 50% by the Buyer and 50% by the Stockholders
Representative.



 

-9- (d) _Adjustment_.

(i) If the Final Closing Date Working Capital is greater than $21,300,000, the
amount of such excess shall be referred to herein as the " _Underpayment
Amount_ "). If the Final Closing Date Working Capital is less than
$20,300,000, the amount of such shortfall shall be referred to herein as the "
_Overpayment Amount_ ").

(ii) Within five (5) Business Days following the Final Determination Date, the
Parties shall recalculate the Closing Consideration using (A) the Funded
Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Costs as finally determined in
accordance with this _ARTICLE II_ and (B) the Final Closing Date Working
Capital, the Underpayment Amount (if any) or the Overpayment Amount (if any),
as the case may be (the " _Final Closing Consideration_ ").

(iii) If the Final Closing Consideration is greater than the Estimated
Closing Consideration, then within five (5) days of the Final Determination
Date, the Surviving Corporation shall pay the difference, _minus_ (A) any
payments of Undisputed Working Capital and interest accrued thereon, if any,
made by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)_, or _plus_ (B)
any payments of Undisputed Working Capital and interest accrued thereon, if
any, made by the Stockholders Representative pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)_
to the Stockholders Representative other than the portion of such payment to
Option Holders, which amount shall be paid to such Option Holders (subject to
_Section 2.2(c)_) through the Companys or its Subsidiarys internal or
third-party payroll processing system.

(iv) If the Final Closing Consideration is less than the Estimated Closing
Consideration, then within five (5) days of the Final Determination Date, the
Stockholders Representative shall pay the difference, minus (A) any payments
of Undisputed Working Capital and interest accrued thereon, if any, made by
the Stockholders Representative pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)_, or plus (B)
any payments of Undisputed Working Capital and interest accrued thereon, if
any, made by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)_, to the
Buyer.

In the event that any Party owes or is obligated to pay any amounts pursuant
to this _Section 2.4_, and such Party fails to pay such amounts when due as
provided in _Section 2.4(d)_, interest shall accrue on any and all such
amounts from the date such payment is due at a rate of ten percent (10%) per
annum, compounded daily, until fully paid (or at the maximum amount then
permitted by applicable Law, if less).

(e)  _Accounting Books and Records_. The Buyer agrees that, following the
Closing through the Final Determination Date, it will not, and will cause the
Acquired Entities not to, take any actions with respect to any accounting
books or records (such as the storage or destruction thereof) on which the
Final Closing Date Working Capital is to be based or derived from that would
impede or delay the determination of the Final Closing Date Working Capital in
the manner and utilizing the methods required by this Agreement.

2004.



 

-15- (u) To the Companys Knowledge, no UK Acquired Entity is or so far as the UK
Acquired Entities are aware, will become liable to pay, reimburse or
indemnify in respect of any Tax which it is not primarily liable in

circumstance arising, occurring, or deemed to arise or occur (whether wholly
or partly) prior to Closing.

customers and suppliers, and other data related to such Acquired Entity
(including for the purposes of performing any environmental assessments or
investigations and audits of compliance with Law) and will furnish or make
available to the Buyer copies of all financial, operating, Tax returns and
other relevant data and information regarding such Acquired Entity as the
Buyer may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer and its
authorized representatives shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
make calls to the customers and suppliers of the Acquired Entities within the
3-Business Day period following the date hereof. Until the Closing Date, the
Company will also deliver to Buyer within thirty (30) days after the end
of each month a copy of the interim, monthly financial reporting package for
such month prepared in a manner and containing information consistent with the
Companys current practice for preparing the Interim Financial Statements. No
information provided to or obtained by Buyer shall affect any representation
or warranty in this Agreement.



 

-29- 5.6 _Confidentiality; Publicity_.

(a) Until such time as an initial, mutually agreed upon press release or other
similar announcement has been made regarding the Transactions, the
Parties will, and will cause each of their Affiliates to, maintain this
Agreement confidential and will not, and will cause each of their Affiliates
not to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions without the
prior written consent of the other Parties, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Party may, without the
prior written consent of the other Parties, issue or cause publication of any
such press release or public announcement to the extent that such Party is
required to do so by Law or by the rules of any applicable self-regulatory
organization, in which event such Party will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to allow the other Parties reasonable time to comment on such press
release or public announcement in advance of its issuance.

5.7  _Update to Schedules_. From time to time on or before the Closing Date,
the Company shall deliver written notice to the Buyer (an " _Update Notice_ ")
to reflect any change, fact, circumstance, occurrence or event (collectively,
" _Change_ "): (a) that may constitute a breach of any covenant or agreement
of the Company or the Stockholders Representative or may constitute a breach
of any representation or warranty of the Company or the Stockholders
Representative if such representation or warranty were made on the date of the
occurrence or discovery of such Change or the Closing Date; or (b) in the case
of any representations or warranties made to the Knowledge of the Company,
which occurred prior to the date hereof but of which the Company first
acquires Knowledge after the date hereof, in each case, together with any
additions, supplements, or modifications necessary to make the information set
forth in the Schedules true, accurate, and complete in all respects as soon
as practicable after such information is available to the Company. At any time
following receipt by the Buyer of any Update Notice setting forth any Change
that constitutes a Material Adverse Effect, the Buyer may, in its sole
discretion and without Liability to the Stockholders or any Acquired Entity,
terminate this Agreement by giving written notice of such termination to the
Company. If any Update Notice sets forth any change that does not constitute
a Material Adverse Effect, upon disclosure thereof the Buyer shall be deemed
to have waived its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)_ or prevent consummation of the Transactions pursuant to  _Section
7.1(a)_ with respect to such Changes set forth in the applicable Update Notice
unless any such Change later becomes a Material Adverse Effect. In the event
that (i) a Change occurs that does not constitute a Material Adverse Effect,
or (ii) a Change occurs that constitutes a Material Adverse Effect but for
which the Buyer does not elect to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 5._7, the Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to deliver to the Stockholders Representative prior to the Closing a notice
setting forth if it then intends to make a claim for indemnification pursuant
to _ARTICLE IX_ (" _Claim Intent Notice_ "), it being
understood, acknowledged and agreed that neither (A) the Update Notice nor
(B) any disclosure after the date hereof of the inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty made in this Agreement or delivery of an updated
Schedule nor (C) the Buyers failure to deliver any such Claim Intent Notice
or Buyers notice in any Claim Intent Notice that it does not intend to make a
claim for  



 

-30-  indemnification shall operate to relieve the Stockholders of their
obligations set forth in _ARTICLE IX_ with respect to such inaccuracy nor
prohibit the Buyer from seeking a claim for indemnification or give the
Stockholders any right with respect to Buyers failure to provide any such
Claim Intent Notice. Solely for purposes of determining Liability and Damages
for breach of representations or warranties either at signing or at Closing,
if any, such determination shall be made without reference to any supplements
and with reference only to the Schedules as they stand on the date of this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the applicable limitations set forth
in _ARTICLE IX_ shall apply to any claim for indemnification after the Closing
with respect to a Change for which an Update Notice has been delivered
pursuant to this _Section 5.7_.

 

5.8 _Liability Insurance; Director and Officer Indemnification_. Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall convert and fully pay for the Companys existing
directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the Acquired
Entities directors and officers to a run-off policy which shall provide such
directors and officers with coverage for six (6) years following
the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and have
other terms not materially less favorable to the insured persons than, the
directors and officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by
the Company (the " _Run-Off Policy_ "). From and after the Closing Date until
the sixth anniversary thereof, the Buyer and the Company shall not, and shall
cause the Acquired Entities not to, without the written consent of the
Stockholders Representative, take any action to (i) cancel, amend or shorten
the term of the Run-Off Policy or (ii) amend or terminate the indemnification
provisions of any Acquired Entitys Organization Documents as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing in any manner that would be reasonably
expected to be adverse to any former officer or director of the Acquired
Entities.

5.9  _Exclusivity_. Each of the Company and the Stockholders Representative
agrees that they will not, and will cause each of their respective Affiliates,
and their and their Affiliates directors, officers, managers,
members, employees, agents, consultants, lenders, financing sources, advisors
or other representatives, including legal counsel, accountants and financial
advisors, not to, directly or indirectly (a) solicit, initiate or encourage
any inquiry, proposal, offer or contact from any Person (other than Buyer and
its Affiliates and representatives) relating to any transaction involving (i)
the sale of any stock or other ownership interest or any assets (other than
the sale of inventory in the Ordinary Course of Business) or debt of any
Acquired Entity, (ii) any acquisition, divestiture, merger, share or unit
exchange, consolidation, redemption, financing or similar transaction
involving any Acquired Entity or (iii) any similar transaction or business
combination involving any Acquired Entity (in each case, an " _Acquisition
Proposal_ "), or (b) participate in any discussion or negotiation regarding,
or furnish any information with respect to, or assist or facilitate in any
manner, any Acquisition Proposal or any attempt to make an Acquisition
Proposal. Each of the Company and the Stockholders Representative shall
immediately cease, and cause to be terminated, any and all
contacts, discussions and negotiations with third parties regarding any of
the foregoing, and the Company, the Seller Parties and the Stockholders
Representative will notify Buyer immediately if any Person makes any proposal,
offer, inquiry or contact related to an Acquisition Proposal and provide
Buyer with the name of the party making such offer, inquiry or contact.

5.10 _Code Section 280G Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall submit to a stockholder vote (along with adequate disclosure satisfying
the requirement of Code Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) and any regulations
promulgated thereunder) the right of any "disqualified  



 

-31-  individual" with respect to the Company (within the meaning of Code Section
280G(c)) to receive or retain certain payments that would
constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Code Section
280G(b)(2)(A)(i)) and which, when added to the aggregate value of all other
"parachute payments" to which the "disqualified individual" is or may
become entitled to receive as a result of the Merger or an event that is
closely associated therewith, would cause a portion of any other payment to
constitute an "excess parachute payments". With respect to each "parachute
payment" submitted for shareholder approval, the individual to whom such
payment would be made shall waive his or her right to receive or to retain
such payment in a manner that satisfies the shareholder approval requirements
of Code Section 280G(b)(5) and any regulations promulgated thereunder to the
extent necessary to cause any such payment to not constitute an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(1). The waiver
of such rights shall be contained in a separate waiver agreement between the
individual and the Company or shall be made a part of the terms of the
agreement giving rise to the individuals right thereto prior to soliciting
the vote described in the immediately preceding sentence such that the vote
shall, if successful, establish each "disqualified individuals" right to
receive or retain the payment. The Company shall provide or cause to be
provided to Buyer, a draft of all stockholder vote related documents,
including, but not limited to, any disclosure statements, "disqualified
individual" waiver agreements, and/or other agreements establishing the
individuals waiver of the right to receive or retain such payments.
The Company shall incorporate any reasonable comments that are made by Buyer.

5.11 _Financing_. Buyer agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain sufficient funds to enable Buyer to consummate the Transactions. In
furtherance of such efforts, Buyer shall submit to its lenders under its
existing credit facilities a notice of borrowing no later than 1:00 p.m. New
York time on the date hereof, which notice shall request Buyers estimate of
sufficient funds, which, together with Buyers other available funds, would
enable Buyer to consummate the Transactions. Upon submission of such notice,
Buyer also shall provide a copy thereof to the Company.

counsel in the contest or defense, make available their personnel, and provide

terminate such Persons employment with such employer (in the case of an
employee) or cease providing its services to such Acquired Entity (in the case
of a consultant or sales or other commercial representative), _provided_ ,

advertising or similar means which are not specifically directed at employees
of, consultants to or agents of any of the Acquired Entities or (y)

6.4 _Certain Prior Agreements_. Following the Closing, the Buyer shall cause
the Acquired Entities not to terminate, modify or otherwise waive any rights

Predecessor Agreements, in each case, without the prior consent of the
Stockholders Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

6.5 _WARN Act_. Following the Closing, the Buyer shall not, and shall cause
the Acquired Entities not to, take any action, or fail to take any action,
where such act or failure to act would give rise to any Liability of the
Stockholders under the WARN Act.



 

-33- 6.6 _Cortec Group Fund III, L.P_. For four years from the date hereof,
Stockholders Representative shall not dissolve, wind up its affairs or take
action that would make it insolvent or otherwise unable to satisfy its
obligations hereunder. If at any time until the date which is 24 months from
the Closing Date, the liquidation value of the assets of Stockholders
Representative (after taking into account all liabilities thereof) is or is
reasonably expected to be less than $7,500,000, then the Stockholders

Notice"). After receipt of the Fund Notice, the Buyer may establish an escrow
fund with the Escrow Agent, the Stockholders Representative shall fund such
escrow fund with $7,500,000 of immediately available funds within

_Section 3.1_ (Corporate Status), _Section 3.3_ (Capitalization;
Subsidiaries) and _Section 3.25_ (Brokers Fees), and (ii) of the Buyer and
Acquisition Sub contained in  _Section 4.1_ (Entity Status), _Section 4.2_
(Power and Authority; Enforceability), _Section 4.5_ (Brokers Fees) and
_Section 4.7_ (Solvency) shall survive indefinitely. Each representation and
warranty of the Company contained in _Section 3.8_ (Tax Matters) and the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Section 3.17_
(Employee Benefits) that could give rise to any Liability for Taxes shall
survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Each representation and
warranty of the Company contained in _Section 3.18_ (Environmental) and the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Section 3.17_
(Employee Benefits) that could not give rise to any Liability for Taxes shall
survive the Closing and will continue in full force and effect until the date
which is two (2) years from the Closing Date. All other representations and
warranties of the Company, the Buyer and Acquisition Sub contained in this
Agreement will survive the Closing and will continue in full force and effect
for twelve (12) months thereafter. If the Buyer or the Stockholders
Representative, as the case may be, provides proper notice of a claim within
the applicable time period set forth in this _Section 9.1(a)_, then Liability
for such claim or matter shall continue until such claim or matter is
resolved.

(b) Each covenant of the Stockholders Representative, the Company or the
Buyer set forth herein shall survive until such time as each such covenant
has been fully performed and satisfied.



 

-38- 9.2 _Indemnification Provisions for the Buyer s Benefit_.

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _ARTICLE IX_ , the Stockholders,
severally, not jointly, pro rata according to such
Stockholders Proportionate Percentage (other than to the extent of the
Escrow Fund for which amount the Buyer may make a claim as if the Stockholders
are jointly liable) shall defend, indemnify, and hold the Buyer Indemnified
Persons harmless from and will reimburse the Buyer Indemnified Persons for
any and all Damages (including any Damages they may suffer or incur after the
end of any applicable survival period, provided that an indemnification claim
with respect to such Damages is made prior to the end of any applicable
survival period), directly or indirectly, resulting from, relating to, arising
out of, or attributable to any one of the following:

(i) any Breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered in connection with this Agreement by
the Company or the Stockholders Representative; 

(ii) any Breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company or the
Stockholders Representative in this Agreement; and

(iii) any Designated Pre-Closing Liabilities.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the subject matter
underlying any Damages that gave rise to a claim for indemnification
pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_ by a Buyer Indemnified Person would give rise
to a claim for indemnification by any Acquired Entity pursuant to any
operative provision of the Predecessor Agreement (a " _Predecessor Claim_ "),
and the Stockholders have paid in full the amount of such claim to Buyer
pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_ , then the Buyer shall subrogate its rights to
proceed against the Predecessor Agreement to the Stockholders Representative
with respect to the Predecessor Claim necessary to permit the Stockholders to
proceed against the sellers under the Predecessor Agreement in the amount of
any claim for such Damages.

9.3 _Indemnification Provisions for Stockholders  Benefit_. The Buyer and the
Company, jointly and severally, will defend, indemnify, and hold the
Stockholder Indemnified Persons harmless from and will reimburse
the Stockholder Indemnified Persons for any and all Damages (including any
Damages they may suffer or incur after the end of any applicable survival
period, provided that an indemnification claim with respect to such Damages is
made prior to the end of any applicable survival period), directly or
indirectly, resulting from, relating to, arising out of, or attributable to
any of the following:

(a) any Breach of any representation or warranty made by the Buyer or
Acquisition Sub in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered in
connection with this Agreement by the Buyer; and

(b) any Breach of any covenant or obligation of the Buyer or Acquisition Sub
in this Agreement.



 

-39- 9.4 _Indemnification Claim Procedures_.

(a) The party seeking indemnity (" _Indemnitee_ ") will give prompt written
notice to the party or parties providing indemnity (" _Indemnitor_ ") of any
matter for which it may make a claim for indemnification after the Closing,
stating the nature, basis and (to the extent known) amount thereof; _provided_
, _however_ , that no delay on the part of Indemnitee in notifying any
Indemnitor shall relieve Indemnitor from any Liability hereunder unless (and
then solely to the extent) Indemnitor is prejudiced by such delay. Copies of
any papers received in connection with any related Action shall be forwarded
to Indemnitor together with the notice of the matter.

(b) In case of any Action by a third party or by any Governmental Authority,
or any Action involving claims brought by such a third party or Governmental
Authority with respect to which Indemnitor may have Liability under the
indemnification provisions contained in this _ARTICLE IX_ (a " _Third-
Party Claim_ "), then Indemnitor shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof at its own expense and by its own counsel, which counsel shall be
reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Indemnitor shall not have the right to assume the defense of such Third-Party
Claim if (i) the Third-Party Claim seeks only an injunction or other equitable
relief, (ii) Indemnitee shall have been advised by counsel that there are one
or more legal or equitable defenses available to Indemnitee that are
different from or in addition to those available to Indemnitor and, in the
reasonable opinion of Indemnitee, counsel for Indemnitor could not adequately
represent Indemnitees interests because they conflict with those of
Indemnitor, (iii) such Third-Party Claim involves, or could have a material
effect on, any material matter beyond the scope of the indemnification
obligation of Indemnitor or (iv) Indemnitor shall not have assumed the
defense of such Third-Party Claim in a timely fashion. If Indemnitor shall
assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim (under circumstances in which the
proviso in the preceding sentence is not applicable), provided that
Indemnitor does not fail to reasonably pursue a defense of such Third-Party
Claim, Indemnitor shall not be responsible for any legal or other defense
costs subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the defense
thereof. If Indemnitor does not exercise its rights to assume the defense of
a Third-Party Claim or is otherwise restricted from so assuming such defense,
Indemnitor shall nevertheless be entitled to participate in such defense with
its own counsel and at its own expense; and in any such case Indemnitee may
assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim, with counsel that shall be
reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitor, and shall act reasonably and in
accordance with its good faith business judgment and shall not effect
any settlement without the consent of Indemnitor, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. If Indemnitor exercises its right to assume
the defense of a Third-Party Claim, it shall not effect any settlement without
the consent of Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed; provided, that such consent shall not be required where (i) the
terms of such settlement do not include or require any finding or admission of
any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of any Person and (ii)
pursuant to the terms of such settlement the sole relief to be provided is
monetary damages that are to be paid in full by Indemnitor. The Indemnitor
will keep the Indemnitee apprised of all material developments, including
settlement offers, with respect to the Third-Party Claim, permit the
Indemnitee, at its sole cost and expense, to participate in the defense of the
Third-Party Claim and promptly provide the Indemnitee with all notices,
filings, communications and documents produced, sent or received and all other
relevant records relating to such matters.



 

-40- 9.5 _Limitations on Indemnification Liability_.

(a) _Limitation for Stockholders_. The Stockholders aggregate Liability for
indemnification of the Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant to  _Section
9.2(a)(i)_ shall not exceed an amount equal to Fifteen Million Dollars
($15,000,000) (the " _Maximum Amount_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Maximum Amount shall not apply with respect to (i) any Damages resulting from
or relating to any Breach of the Special Representations, and (ii) any Action
arising from fraud by the Acquired Entities or the Stockholders
Representative. Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in the preceding
sentence, in no event (other than fraud) shall the Stockholders aggregate
Liability for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement exceed the Purchase
Price.

(b) _Threshold for Stockholders_. The Stockholders will have no Liability for
indemnification of the Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant to  _Section
9.2(a)(i)_ unless and until the aggregate Damages claimed thereunder exceed an
amount equal to Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) (the " _Threshold Amount_ "),
and once the aggregate amount of such Damages under  _Section 9.2(a)(i)_
exceeds the Threshold Amount, the Buyer Indemnified Persons will be entitled
to recover all such Damages to which they are entitled in excess of the
Threshold Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Threshold Amount shall
not apply with respect to (i) any Damages resulting from or relating to any
Breach of the Special Representations, and (ii) any Action arising from fraud
by the Acquired Entities or the Stockholders Representative. 

(c) Solely for purposes of determining whether there has been any
misrepresentation or breach of a representation or warranty and for purposes
of determining the amount of Damages resulting from any misrepresentation or
breach of a representation or warranty (but not for purposes of determining
the satisfaction of any condition set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ ), all
qualifications or exceptions in any representation or warranty relating to or
referring to the terms "material", "materiality", "in all material respects",
"Material Adverse Effect" or any similar term or phrase shall be disregarded,
it being the understanding of the Parties that for purposes of determining
liability under this _ARTICLE IX_ the representations and warranties of the
Parties contained in this Agreement shall be read as if such terms and
phrases were not included in them; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of determining whether any
misrepresentation or breach has occurred of a representation or warranty
contained in _Sections 3.5, 3.8(c), 3.12, 3.22(b) or 3.22(c)_ , such
representations and warranties shall be deemed to have been given as drafted
and to include, for purposes of this _ARTICLE IX_ all qualifications as to
"material", "materiality", "in all material respects", or any similar term or
phrase.

9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. In the absence of fraud and without limitation to
the provisions of _Sections 9.2(b)_ and _11.5_ and except for equitable
relief, after the Closing, indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_ and
_ARTICLE X_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for the Parties with
respect to all claims for monetary Damages arising under this Agreement of
any kind or nature, including, without limitation, for any misrepresentation
or Breach of any warranty, covenant, or other provision contained in this
Agreement.

9.7 _Special Damages_. OTHER THAN WITH RESPECT TO THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS, EACH OF
THE PARTIES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW HEREBY  



 

-41-  IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHTS THAT IT MAY HAVE TO PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, TREBLE,
INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, ANY RELATED AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS OR
ACTIONS OF ANY OF THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY RELATED AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS. 

9.8 _Reduction of Purchase Price_. Any indemnification amounts payable by the
Stockholders pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_ shall be treated for all Tax
purposes to be an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless a final
determination by a Governmental Authority requires otherwise.

9.9  _Payment_. In pursuing the collection of any Damages arising under
_Section 9.2_, other than relating to Taxes or Designated Pre-Closing
Liabilities (for which the Buyer may, at its option, proceed against the
Escrow Fund or directly to the Stockholders), the Buyer shall proceed first
against the Escrow Fund for the amount of such Damages in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement and, in the event that the Escrow Fund is
insufficient to satisfy a claim for such Damages, then against the
Stockholders subject to the provisions of this _ARTICLE IX_. Any
indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_ shall be effected by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
the Stockholders Representative or the Buyer, as the case may be, within
three (3) Business Days after the determination thereof, whether pursuant to a
final judgment, settlement or agreement among the Parties. For purposes of
this Agreement, "severally" means that each Stockholder will be responsible
for his, her or its Proportionate Percentage of Damages after the entire
amount of the Escrow Fund has been used to satisfy Damages, but to the extent
of the Escrow Fund, the Buyer may pursue the collection of any Damages
regardless of any individual Stockholders Proportionate Percentage.

9.10 _Calculation of Indemnity Payments_. The obligation of any Party to make
payments in respect of indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_ or
_ARTICLE X_ shall be limited to the amount of any Damages that remain after
deducting therefrom (and for purposes of determining if the Threshold Amount
has been met (if applicable), the aggregate amount of all Damages claimed by
the Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ shall be
reduced by the amount of) (i) any Tax Benefit and (ii)(A) any insurance
proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually
recovered by the Buyer Indemnified Persons from any third party with respect
thereto and (B) any amounts previously paid by the Stockholders with respect
thereto whether pursuant to _Section 2.4_, this _ARTICLE IX_ , _ARTICLE X_ or
otherwise. To the extent that it is finally determined that a Buyer
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE
IX_ or _ARTICLE X_ on a date which is more than 12 months from the Closing
Date and the Stockholders Representative fails to fund its portion (as a
Stockholder) of any such Damages within 10 days of such final determination,
then the amount of such Damages for which the Stockholders Representative is
required to indemnify such Buyer Indemnified Person shall accrue interest at a
rate per annum equal to the lesser of the Prime Rate and the maximum rate
permitted by applicable Law from the date of such final determination until
the date such amount is paid in full to such Buyer Indemnified Person. Such
interest shall be payable in immediately available funds upon payment of the
amount paid in settlement or final adjudication of any such Damages.



 

-42- ARTICLE X

TAX MATTERS

10.1 _Tax Indemnification Provisions for Buyer s Benefit_.

(a) Each Stockholder, severally, not jointly, pro rata according to its
Proportionate Percentage shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons and
hold them harmless from and will reimburse the Buyer Indemnified Persons for
all Taxes of the Acquired Entities ending on or before the Closing Date. For
purposes of this definition the term Taxes shall include any interest and
penalties with respect to such Taxes.

(b) Any obligation of any Stockholder to make payments in respect of
indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_ shall be limited to the amount
of any Liability that remains after deducting therefrom any Tax Benefit
actually realized.

10.2 _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_.

(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Company shall
cause the Acquired Entities to prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, on a timely basis, all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by
each Acquired Entity prior to the Closing Date, all consistent with each such
Acquired Entitys past custom and practice (except to the extent otherwise
required by Law), and shall timely pay all Taxes shown as due thereon.

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, each Acquired
Entity, under the direction of the Stockholders Representative, shall prepare
or cause to be prepared (i) Tax Returns for any taxable periods of each such
Acquired Entity ending prior to the Closing Date which have not been filed as
of the Closing Date (" _Unfiled Prior Year Returns_ "), (ii) Tax Returns for
any taxable periods of each such Acquired Entity ending on the Closing Date
(such period being a " _Final Tax Year_ " and such returns being " _Final
Year Returns_ "; Unfiled Prior Year Returns and Final Year Returns being
collectively the " _Reviewable Returns_ "), all in accordance with each such
Acquired Entitys past custom and practice (except to the extent otherwise
required by Law). The Stockholders Representative shall provide the Buyer
with copies of all Reviewable Returns no later than thirty (30) days prior to
their due date. Unless the Buyer, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of
any Reviewable Return gives the Stockholders Representative a notice
objecting to such Reviewable Return and specifying the basis for such
objection and the amount in dispute, such Reviewable Return shall be
considered accepted and binding upon the Buyer and the Stockholders
Representative. If within such fifteen (15) day period, the Buyer gives the
Stockholders Representative such a notice of objection, and any disagreement
is not resolved by the Buyer and the Stockholders Representative within five
(5) days thereafter, the dispute shall be resolved by negotiation or
submission to the Arbitrating Accountants. Within three (3) Business Days
after a Reviewable Return becomes final (either through resolution of any
disputes and modification of the applicable Reviewable Return to reflect such
resolution or at the expiration of the period for the Buyer
Stockholders Representative to object if no objection is made), the
Stockholders Representative shall pay to the Buyer any unpaid Tax Liability
shown thereon.



 

-43- (c) The Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall prepare and file, or cause
to be prepared and filed, on a timely basis, all Tax Returns for the Acquired
Entities with respect to taxable periods of the Acquired Entities that begin
before and end after the Closing Date (" _Straddle Tax Periods_ " and all such
Tax Returns, " _Straddle Period Returns_ "). All such Straddle Period Returns
shall be prepared on a basis consistent with each such Acquired Entitys past
custom and practice (except to the extent otherwise required by Law). The
Buyer shall provide the Stockholders Representative with copies of all
Straddle Period Returns no later than thirty (30) days prior to their due
date, accompanied by a calculation (the " _Stub Period Calculation_ ") of the
Tax liability of the Acquired Entities attributable to the portion of the
Straddle Tax Period (the " _Stub Period_ ") ending on the Closing Date,
determined in accordance with _Section 10.3_. Unless the Stockholders
Representative, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of any Straddle Period
Return or Stub Period Calculation, gives the Buyer a notice objecting to such
Straddle Period Return or Stub Period Calculation and specifying the basis for
such objection and the amount in dispute, the Straddle Period Return or Stub
Period Calculation, as the case may be, shall be considered accepted and
binding upon the Buyer and the Stockholders Representative. If within such
fifteen (15) day period, the Stockholders Representative gives the Buyer
such a notice of objection, and any disagreement is not resolved by the Buyer
and the Stockholders Representative within five (5) days thereafter, the
dispute shall be resolved by negotiation or submission to the Arbitrating
Accountants. Within three (3) Business Days after a Straddle Period Return or
Stub Period Calculation becomes final (either through resolution of any
disputes and modification of the applicable Straddle Period Return or Stub
Period Calculation to reflect such resolution or at the expiration of the
period for the Stockholders Representative to object if no objection is
made), the Stockholders Representative shall pay to the Buyer any unpaid Tax
Liability for the Stub Period shown on the applicable Stub Period Calculation.

10.3 _Allocation of Straddle Tax Period Allocations_.

(a) In the case of a Straddle Tax Period, the amount of any Taxes based on or
measured by income or receipts of the Acquired Entities for any taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

(b) The amount of other Taxes of the Acquired Entities for a Straddle Tax
Period that relates to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing
Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle
Tax Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days in the taxable period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in such Straddle Tax Period.

10.4 _Elections, Amended Returns, Etc_. Without the prior written consent of
the Stockholders Representative (which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), or as otherwise required by Law, neither the Buyer nor
any Acquired Entity shall, with respect to any Tax period ending on or before
the Closing Date (i) make any election, (ii) change the tax treatment of any
item on a Tax Return filed after the Closing Date as compared to the treatment
of such item on a Tax Return filed by any Acquired Entity prior to the Closing
Date or (iii) file any amended Tax Return or propose or agree to any
adjustment of any item with the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing
authority, if in any such case such action would have the effect of increasing
the indemnification obligations of any Stockholder.



 

-44- 10.5 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, and
the Stockholders Representative shall provide, and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Acquired Entities to provide, each other with such assistance
as may reasonably be requested by the others in connection with the
preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other examination by any
Governmental Authority, or any judicial or administrative proceedings relating
to Liabilities for Taxes. Such assistance shall include making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or
explanation of material provided hereunder and shall include providing copies
of relevant Tax Returns and supporting material. The party requesting
assistance hereunder shall reimburse the assisting party for reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses incurred in providing assistance. The Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation and the Stockholders Representative will retain, and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Acquired Entities to retain, for the
full period of any statute of limitations and provide the others with any
records or information which may be relevant to such preparation, audit,
examination, proceeding or determination.

10.6 _Tax Contests_.

(a) If any Governmental Authority issues to any of the Acquired Entities a
written notice of its intent to audit or examine Tax Returns of any of the
Acquired Entities for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date or any Straddle Period Returns, the Buyer or the Acquired Entities shall
notify the Stockholders Representative of its receipt of such communication
from the Governmental Authority within ten (10) Business Days after receiving
such notice.

(b) The Stockholders Representative shall control any examination,
investigation, audit or other proceeding in respect of any Tax Return or Taxes
of any of the Acquired Entities for any taxable period ending on or prior to
the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Contest_ "), provided that (i) the
Buyer shall have the right to participate in any Pre-Closing Tax Contest and
(ii) the Stockholders Representative shall not settle or otherwise resolve
any Pre-Closing Tax Contest (or any issue raised in such Pre-Closing Tax
Contest) if such settlement or other resolution relates to Taxes for which
Buyer and the Acquired Entities are liable under this Agreement or which would
have an adverse effect on the Buyer or the Acquired Entities for taxable
periods ending after the Closing Date without the consent of the Buyer or the
Acquired Entities (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). The Buyer shall control any examination, investigation, audit or
other proceeding in respect of any Straddle Period Returns or Taxes of any of
the Acquired Entities for Straddle Tax Periods (a " _Straddle Period Tax
Contest_ "), provided that (i) the Stockholders Representative shall have
the right to participate in any such Straddle Period Tax Contest, and (ii) the
Buyer shall not settle or otherwise resolve any Straddle Period Tax Contest
(or any issue raised in such Straddle Period Tax Contest) if such settlement
or other resolution relates to Taxes for which the Stockholders
Representative is liable under this Agreement without the consent of the
Stockholders Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed).



 

-45- (c) If there is an adjustment to any Tax Return for any of the Acquired
Entities which creates a deficiency in any Taxes for which the Stockholders
are liable under the provisions of _Section 10.1_ hereof, the Stockholders
Representative shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Buyer the amount of such
deficiency in Taxes. No liability of the Stockholders under this _Section
10.6(c)_ shall be payable until the occurrence of any action by any
Governmental Authority that is final or, if not final, is acquiesced in by the
Stockholders during the course of the relevant Tax Contest. All payments
required to be made by the Stockholders pursuant to this _Section 10.6(c)_
shall be made within ten (10) Business Days of the occurrence of the event
described in the immediately preceding sentence. 

10.7 _Refunds and Tax Attribute Items_. All refunds, plus interest thereon
paid by a Governmental Authority, of Taxes with respect to a Reviewable
Return or Stub Period, other than refunds resulting from a carryback of a
loss, deduction or credit from a taxable period beginning after the Closing
Date that is not a Tax Attribute Item, shall be paid to the
Stockholders Representative for the benefit of the Stockholders by the
Surviving Corporation within ten (10) days following actual receipt by any
Acquired Entity. To the extent that any Tax Attribute Item results in a
reduction of Tax Liability on any Post-Closing Tax Return (including any
quarterly estimated Tax Returns) Buyer shall pay to the Stockholders
Representative any Tax Benefit that is realized within ten (10) days following
actual realization thereof. Tax Attribute Items will be deemed realized with
respect to any Reviewable Return and any Tax Return for any Stub Period when
any refunds resulting from the carryback of such Tax Attribute Items are
actually received. Tax Attribute Items will be deemed realized with respect
to any Post-Closing Tax Return when such Tax Attribute Items result in a
reduction of Tax Liability on any Tax Return for such future Tax year
(including any quarterly estimated Tax Returns); provided that, with respect
to Post-Closing Tax Returns, Tax Attribute Items will be deemed the last
deductions utilized by an Acquired Entity; provided, further that to the
extent a Governmental Authority successfully challenges the deductibility of
any Tax Attribute Items taken into account in the payment of any amounts to
the Stockholders Representative pursuant to this _Section 10.7_, that
portion of the payments that relate to such Tax Attribute Items shall be
repaid to Buyer at the time the challenge by the Governmental Authority
becomes final. Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to utilize any
Tax Attribute Items to the fullest extent permissible by Law. For the
avoidance of doubt, Tax Attribute Items shall not be taken into account with
respect to the calculation of Final Closing Date Working Capital.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that it is determined in
accordance with this ARTICLE X that an amount is to be paid to any Buyer
Indemnified Party and all or any part of such amount has not been paid, then
the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to set off or recoup
such amount from any amount to be paid to the Stockholders (or the
Stockholders Representative on their behalf) pursuant to this ARTICLE X.

10.8 _Transfer and Similar Taxes_. All real property transfer or gains taxes,
other transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration, stamp and similar
Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection
with this Agreement shall be paid one-half by the Stockholders Representative
and one-half by the Buyer. The Stockholders Representative shall file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes
and fees, and the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall, and shall cause
the other Acquired Entities to, reasonably cooperate with the Stockholders
Representative in connection therewith.



 

-46- 10.9 _No Limitation_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to
the contrary, the rights and obligations of the Parties hereto set forth in
this _ARTICLE X_ shall not be subject to the limitations in _ARTICLE IX_
(Indemnification). In the event of a conflict between this _ARTICLE X_ and any
other provision of this Agreement, this _ARTICLE X_ shall govern and control.
