after receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party Claim.
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party,
within five (5) business days after the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that

&nbsp;If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so
chooses and acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party
therefor, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party.
Notwithstanding any acknowledgment made pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, the Indemnifying Party shall continue to be entitled to assert any
limitation on its indemnification responsibility contained in <U>Sections 16(j)</U> and
<U>16(k)</U>. Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party
for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection
with the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and
to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnifying Party, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party
shall control such defense. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees
and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during
which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof. If the
Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, all the parties
hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Party's
request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Indemnified Party shall not
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any
Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) unless and until (A) the Indemnified
Party has given an Indemnification Notice in accordance with this Agreement, (B)
at least sixty (60) days have passed from the date on which the Indemnifying
Party has received such Indemnification Notice and (C) the Indemnifying Party

or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued
or made by any party hereto (including any member of the BP Amoco Group) without
the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), except (a) as such release or announcement may be required by law or
the rules or regulations of any securities exchange, whether in the United
States, United Kingdom or elsewhere, (or in the opinion of counsel such release
or announcement is appropriate or desirable under or in light of such laws and
regulations), in which case the party making the release or announcement shall
allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement
in advance of such issuance, and (b)&nbsp;that any member of the BP Amoco Group,
including Seller, may make such an announcement to its employees.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to prepare a

prior written consent of the other party and any purported assignment without
such consent shall be void and without effect, except to an affiliate or to a
third party solely for the purposes of financing the purchase price for the
Purchased Assets in which case no such consent shall be required.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Seller may assign or transfer any or all of
its rights hereunder to any qualified intermediary in order to complete an
exchange of like-kind property under Section 1031 of the Code and, at the
request of Seller, Buyer shall execute such agreements and other documents as

complete and otherwise effectuate Seller&#146;s exchange of properties in
accordance with said Section 1031 of the Code and the regulations thereunder and
(ii) Buyer may assign or transfer any or all of its rights hereunder to any
qualified intermediary in order to complete an exchange of like-kind property

shall in no manner affect the right at a later time to enforce the same. No
waiver by any party of any condition, or of any breach of any term, covenant,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, in any one or more
instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing wavier
of any such condition or breach or a waiver of any other condition or of any
