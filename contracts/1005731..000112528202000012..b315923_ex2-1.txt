         Section 2.4 Excluded Liabilities. The Buyer shall not assume or be
obligated to pay, perform or otherwise discharge any liabilities or obligations

         Section 2.5 Assumption of Certain Leases and Other Contracts. The
Sellers shall assume and assign to the Buyer, effective upon the Closing, the
Assumed Agreements on the following terms and conditions:

              (a) From and after the Closing Date until 120 days thereafter, the
         applicable Sellers shall assume and such Sellers shall assign to the
         Buyer the Assumed Agreements pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy
         Code. The Assumed Agreements are listed on Exhibit A hereto, as amended
         from time to time pursuant to this Section 2.5(a), and are identified
         by the date of the Assumed Agreement (if available), the other party or

         the list of Assumed Agreements by delivering a marked copy of such list
         to Sellers, and such changes shall be effective immediately upon
         receipt by Sellers. The Sellers shall give prompt notice of such
         addition or deletion to the counter-party to such agreement, and to the
         respective counsels to the Pre-petition Agent, the Post-petition Agent
         and the Creditors' Committee.

              (b) If there exists any default related to an Assumed Agreement
         which is required to be cured as a condition to the Sellers' assumption
         and assignment pursuant to Section 365(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, the
         Buyer shall promptly cure any such default (including, paying any and
         all such amounts, whether arising pre-petition or post-petition, to
         effect such cure pursuant to Section 365(a) of the Bankruptcy Code) as
         a condition to the assumption and assignment of such Assumed Agreement.
         From time to time after the Closing, the Buyer shall provide funds to
         the Sellers or directly to the counter-party thereto (by wire transfer
         of immediately-available U.S. funds) in an amount sufficient to pay all
         such cure amounts required by the Bankruptcy Court, unless otherwise
         agreed by such counter-party, as a condition for assumption and
         assignment of the Assumed Agreements. Immediately upon receipt by the
         Sellers of such funds, the Sellers shall hold such funds in trust for
         such counter-party, and shall pay all cure amounts for such Assumed
         Agreements. The Buyer alone shall be liable for payment of any cure
         payment in respect of any Assumed Agreement. From and after the Closing
         Date, the Buyer shall designate the contracts and other agreements of
         Sellers that it desires Sellers to reject and Sellers shall promptly
         make appropriate motions with the Bankruptcy Court and take all other
         action to reject all such designated contracts and other agreements. In
         the case of non-residential real property leases, such notice shall be
         irrevocable and accompanied by delivery of all keys to the subject
         premises in the Buyer's possession.

         adequate assurance of future performance and any and all costs and
         expenses necessary in connection therewith regarding any of the Assumed
         Agreements under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code.

         Section 2.6 Intercompany Receivables. All intercompany receivables owed
by and between the Sellers shall be cancelled on the Closing Date.

         Section 2.7 Winstar Building. The Buyer shall, at its option, be
entitled to enter into a sublease following the Closing Date, with rent to be
set at prevailing market rates in the building and otherwise on terms reasonably
satisfactory to the Sellers, with the Sellers to occupy the office space in the
Winstar Building to which the Sellers have occupancy rights under the terms of
the AON Sublease (the thirty-first floor until January 31, 2002, the non-hub
portion of the tenth floor until March 31, 2002, and the hub portion of the
tenth floor until April 30, 2002). After the expiration of such term with
respect to the hub portion of the tenth floor, the Buyer shall, at its option,
be entitled to enter into an agreement with the Sellers to occupy such portion
of the tenth floor of the Winstar Building (to the extent of such Sellers'
occupancy rights) through the duration of the AON Sublease, and if the Buyer
shall exercise such option, the Buyer shall pay rent at the prevailing market
rate in the building for such space which rent shall be paid upon exercise of
the option in a lump-sum payment based on the present value of such rent.

                                  ARTICLE III
                                 PURCHASE PRICE

         Section 3.1 Purchase Price. In consideration for the Purchased Assets,
and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall assume
the Assumed Liabilities, and on the Closing Date, shall irrevocably (i) pay, at
Sellers' election (which shall be exercised before the Closing Date), either (x)
an amount in cash equal to $38,000,000 (the "Cash Payment") or (y) an amount in
cash equal to $30,000,000 and cause to be issued to the Sellers a number of
shares of Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of IDT Corporation
(the "IDT Class B Stock") having a value equal to $12,500,000 based on the
average closing price of IDT Class B Stock during the seven trading day period
ended December 14, 2001 (the "IDT Shares" and together with the $30,000,000, the
"Cash/Stock Payment"), and (ii) issue to the Sellers such number of shares of
common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Buyer (the "Buyer Common
Stock"), representing 5% of the outstanding shares of Buyer Common Stock as of
the date hereof (the "Buyer Shares" and together with either the Cash Payment or
the Cash/Stock Payment, as applicable, the "Purchase Price"). It is understood
and agreed that the Buyer shall issue to IDT Corporation or its designee shares
representing the remaining 95% of the Buyer Common Stock and preferred stock,
$0.01 par value per share, of the Buyer (the "Buyer Preferred Stock") which
Buyer Preferred Stock grants to the holders thereof the right to recovery of
amounts invested in the Buyer by its affiliates prior to any right of the Buyer
or Sellers to receive amounts on account of the Buyer Common Stock (but having
no other preferential rights or voting rights).

         It is understood and agreed that the IDT Shares delivered at Closing
shall not be registered in accordance with the Securities Act and shall be
"restricted" as a result thereof. IDT Corporation shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause a registration statement to become effective with
respect to such IDT Shares within 60 days following the Closing Date. In the
event that the IDT Shares are not duly registered within 60 days following the
Closing Date, any holder thereof may require at any time within 30 days
thereafter that IDT Corporation repurchase all or a portion of the IDT Shares
held by it for cash consideration equal to a price per share of $10,000,000
divided by the number of IDT shares issued as part of the Purchase Price.

         Section 3.2 Cash Payment at Signing. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement,
on or before the date hereof, the Buyer shall deliver, or shall have delivered,
the Cash Payment to the Escrow Agent to be held in escrow pending the Closing.
On the Closing Date, the Sellers and the Buyer shall instruct the Escrow Agent
to promptly release the Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.

         Section 3.3 Allocation of Purchase Price. Prior to the Closing, the
Buyer and the Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to agree as to the
allocation of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code and the
rules and regulations thereunder. The Buyer and the Sellers agree to use such
allocation in filing all required forms under Section 1060 of the Code and all
other Tax Returns, and the Buyer and the Sellers further agree that they shall
not take any position inconsistent with such allocation on any examination of
any such Tax Return, in any refund claim or in any Tax litigation. The Buyer
acknowledges that, based upon the manner it valued the Purchased Assets, the
substantial portion of the Purchase Price is, to the extent permitted by
applicable Tax laws and rules, allocated to Accounts Receivable. Upon the
request of the other, the Buyer and the Sellers agree to provide the other
information reasonably necessary to complete Form 8594. Not later than thirty
(30) days prior to the filing of their respective Forms 8594 relating to this
transaction, each party shall deliver to the other party a copy of its Form
8594. In the event of a dispute with respect to any part of the allocation of
the Purchase Price, the Buyer and the Sellers shall attempt to reconcile their
differences and any resolution by them as to any disputed allocation shall be
final, binding and conclusive on the parties. If the Buyer and the Sellers are
unable to reach a resolution on such differences within thirty (30) days after
the date any such dispute arises, the Buyer and the Sellers shall submit the
disputed allocations for determination and resolution to the Bankruptcy Court,
which shall be instructed to determine and report to the parties, upon such
disputed allocations, and such report shall be final, binding and conclusive on
the parties hereto with respect to the disputed allocations.

                                   ARTICLE IV

of the Sale Order, the receipt of the FCC Consents, the receipt of the State
Regulatory Consents and receipt of the Other Regulatory Approvals which may be
required, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Buyer nor
the purchase by the Buyer of the Purchased Assets and the assumption by the

otherwise obtained or made (other than any filings required by the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act or the rules of the New York Stock Exchange).

financial or other bases on which it would be reasonably be expected to be
deemed not qualified to hold the FCC Licenses, the State Regulatory Licenses or
any of the other Permits, including any foreign ownership that would disqualify
or limit its ability to control the FCC Licenses and State Regulatory Licenses.
Other than revocations for failure to pay fees or make required filings (all of
which have been remedied prior to the date hereof), neither the Buyer nor any of
its Affiliates has had any material permit, certificate, license, franchise or
other government authorization, consent or approval revoked or rescinded or has
been subject to any material proceeding or investigation by the FCC or any
comparable state regulatory agency with respect to any of its or its Affiliates'
operations.

claims, actions, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the knowledge of
the Buyer, threatened against or relating to the Buyer before any court or other
Governmental Authority acting in an adjudicative capacity which could reasonably

transactions contemplated hereby.

         Section 5.6 Brokers. No Person is entitled to any brokerage, financial

its Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

         Section 5.10 Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties. The
Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Buyer is purchasing the Purchased
Assets on an "as-is, where-is" basis and that the Sellers make no representation

                            COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

         Section 6.1 Conduct of Business. (a) Except as required (other than
pursuant to a request, application or motion by any Seller) by the Bankruptcy
Court and the Bankruptcy Code, during the period commencing on the date of this
Agreement and ending on the Closing Date, the Sellers shall (i) operate the
Business in the usual, regular and ordinary course as conducted during the 30
days prior to December 17, 2001 (ii) other than as permitted in writing by the
Buyer, use their reasonable efforts to preserve in all material respects the
Business, its employees and its operations, and (iii) refrain from executing any
material contract other than in the ordinary course as conducted during the 30
days prior to December 17, 2001.

              (b) Prior to the Closing Date, without the prior written consent
of the Buyer, no Seller shall terminate, extend or otherwise amend any of the
FCC Licenses or State Regulatory Licenses, other than in the ordinary course of
business. Prior to the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of the
Buyer, no Seller shall sell, lease (as lessor), transfer or otherwise dispose
of, any of the Purchased Assets.

              (c) Prior to the termination of the Management Agreement, the
Buyer shall take no action or actions which would constitute the exercise of
control over the FCC Licenses or with respect to State Regulatory Licenses
managed under the Management Agreement in violation of applicable law; provided
that performance under the Management Agreement shall not be deemed a breach of
this Section 6.1(c).

         Section 6.2 Access to Information; Maintenance of Records. (a) Between
the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, each Seller shall, during
ordinary business hours, upon reasonable notice (i) give the Buyer and the Buyer
Representatives reasonable access to all books, records, plants, offices and
other facilities and properties constituting the Purchased Assets to which the
Buyer is not denied access by law, (ii) permit the Buyer to make such reasonable
inspections thereof as the Buyer may reasonably request, (iii) furnish the Buyer
with such financial and operating data and other information with respect to the
Business as the Buyer may from time to time reasonably request, (iv) furnish the
Buyer a copy of each material report, schedule or other document filed or
received by such Seller with respect to the Business with the SEC and other
Governmental Authorities; provided, however, that (A) any such access shall be
conducted in such a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the
operation of the Business, (B) such Seller shall not be required to take any
action which would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege and (C)
such Seller need not supply the Buyer with any information which such Seller is
under a legal obligation not to supply. Notwithstanding anything in this Section
6.2(a) to the contrary, the Buyer shall not have access to any of the Employee
Records and personnel and medical records, which in such Seller's good faith
judgment is sensitive or the disclosure of which could subject such Seller to
any material risk of substantial liability.

                                       15

              (b) The Buyer and the Sellers acknowledge that they are subject to
the Confidentiality Agreement. All information furnished to or obtained by the
Buyer or any of the Buyer Representatives or the Sellers or any of the Sellers'
Representatives pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement and shall be treated as Confidential Information
for all purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement. Furthermore, the Buyer
acknowledges that the Sellers or any of the Sellers' Representatives may furnish
Confidential Information to counsel for the Creditors' Committee and to the
Pre-petition Agent and the Post-petition Agent and their respective counsel,
subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. The terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall cease to apply to the parties thereto after the
Closing Date.

              (c) For a period of the later of (x) three (3) years (subject to
Section 6.7(a)) after the Closing Date and (y) the date of entry of an order of
the Bankruptcy Court closing the Chapter 11 Cases, or if converted to a case
under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, an order of the Bankruptcy Court closing
such case, each party and its representatives shall have reasonable access to
all of the books and records relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets,
including all information pertaining to the Assumed Agreements, all Employee
Records or other personnel and medical records required by law, legal process or
subpoena, in the possession of the other party to the extent that such access
may reasonably be required by such party in connection with the Assumed
Liabilities or the Excluded Liabilities, or other matters relating to or
affected by the operation of the Business and the Purchased Assets. Such access
shall be afforded by the party in possession of such books and records upon
receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours; provided,
however, that (i) any such access shall be conducted in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the operation of the business of any party or its
Affiliates, (ii) no party shall be required to take any action which would
constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege, and (iii) no party need
supply the other party with any information which such party is under a legal
obligation not to supply. The party exercising this right of access shall be
solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant to this
Section 6.2(c). If the party in possession of such books and records shall
desire to dispose of any such books and records upon or prior to the expiration
of such period, such party shall, prior to such disposition, give the other
party a reasonable opportunity at such other party's expense, to segregate and
remove such books and records as such other party may select. Furthermore, the
Buyer acknowledges that Winstar shall have reasonable access (as set forth
above) to all Transferred Employees with respect to the litigation matters set
forth on Schedule 2.2(d) for so long as such matters are pending. In addition to
the foregoing, the Buyer agrees to maintain the Employee Records in its
possession for a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date and to give
former and current employees of the Sellers reasonable access to such Employee
Records during such period.

         Section 6.3 Expenses. Except to the extent specifically provided herein
or in the Sale Order or the Management Agreement, whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be borne by the party incurring such costs and expenses.

         Section 6.4 Further Assurances. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts
(subject, in the case of the Sellers or any Chapter 7 trustee, to available
funding and without being required to make any payment to any third party or to
incur any significant economic burden) to take, or cause to be taken, all
action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective the sale of the Purchased Assets in accordance with this Agreement,
including using reasonable best efforts to ensure timely satisfaction of the
conditions precedent to each party's obligations hereunder. Neither any of the
Sellers, on the one hand, nor the Buyer, on the other hand, shall, without the
prior written consent of the other party (it being understood that the written
consent of Winstar shall have the same effect as the consent of all of the
Sellers), take any action which would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impede, interfere with or delay the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. From time to time on or after the Closing Date, each Seller shall, at
its own expense, execute and deliver such documents to the Buyer as the Buyer
may reasonably request in order to more effectively vest in the Buyer such
Seller's title to the Purchased Assets subject to Permitted Encumbrances. From
time to time after the date hereof, the Buyer shall, at its own expense, execute
and deliver such documents to each Seller as such Seller may reasonably request
in order to more effectively consummate the sale of the Purchased Assets and the
assumption and assignment of the Assumed Liabilities and the Assumed Agreements
in accordance with this Agreement.

              (b) In the event that any Purchased Asset shall not have been
conveyed to the Buyer at the Closing, the applicable Seller shall, subject to
Section 6.4(c), use reasonable best efforts to convey such asset to the Buyer as
promptly as is practicable after the Closing.

              (c) To the extent that any of the Sellers' rights under any
Assumed Agreement may not be assigned without the consent of another Person
which consent has not been obtained, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign the same if an attempted assignment would constitute a
breach thereof or be unlawful and such Seller shall cooperate (without being
required to make any payment to any third party or to incur any significant
economic burden) to obtain any such required consent(s) as promptly as
reasonably possible unless failure to obtain such consent would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, and the Buyer
agrees to fully cooperate with such Seller in its efforts to obtain any such
consent (including the submission of such financial or other information
concerning the Buyer and the execution of any assumption agreements or similar
documents reasonably requested by a third party) without being required to make
any payment to any third party or to incur any economic burden.

         Section 6.5 Public Statements. Winstar and the Buyer shall consult with
each other prior to issuing any public announcement, statement or other
disclosure with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, except that the parties may make disclosures with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to the extent and under the
circumstances in which the parties are expressly permitted by the
Confidentiality Agreement to make disclosures of Confidential Information or
otherwise required by law or New York Stock Exchange regulations.

Consents. Subject to Section 6.6(d), within thirty (30) days after the entry of
the Sale Order, the Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, the necessary application or applications with the FCC seeking the FCC
Consents and thereafter, shall promptly make all other filings and notifications
and promptly seek all such consents, licenses, approvals, permits, waivers,
orders or authorizations as may be required to obtain the FCC Consents. The
Sellers shall cooperate with the Buyer to the fullest extent reasonably possible
to provide all necessary information for the preparation of such applications
within ten (10) Business Days after entry of the Sale Order, including those
portions of such applications which are required to be completed by the Sellers.
The Sellers and the Buyer shall prosecute such applications with all reasonable
diligence and otherwise use their reasonable best efforts (including, with
respect to Buyer, providing financial assurance to the extent required) to
obtain grants of approval as expeditiously as practicable. The Buyer shall bear
all reasonable fees payable by the Buyer and/or the Sellers to the FCC and to
any outside counsel employed by the Sellers or Buyer in connection with the
preparation and filing of the applications for the FCC Consents.

              (b) State Regulatory Consents. Subject to Section 6.6(e), within
thirty (30) days after the entry of the Sale Order, the Sellers and/or the
Buyer, as applicable, shall each file or cause to be filed with any state or
local regulatory authorities analogous to the FCC applications for the approval
of the assignment of the State Regulatory Licenses. The Sellers and the Buyer
shall prosecute such applications with all reasonable diligence and otherwise
use their reasonable best efforts (including, with respect to Buyer, providing
financial assurance to the extent required) to obtain grants of approval as
expeditiously as practicable. The Buyer shall bear all reasonable fees payable
by the Buyer and/or the Sellers to the state and local regulatory entities and
to any outside counsel employed by the Sellers or Buyer in connection with the
preparation and filing of the applications for the State Regulatory Consents.

              (c) Other Governmental Authority Approvals. The Sellers and the
Buyer shall each use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other
in determining any filings, notifications and requests for approval (other than
the FCC Consents and the State Regulatory Consents) required to be made and
received prior to the Closing under applicable law or regulation (collectively,
the "Other Regulatory Approvals"). In connection with any Other Regulatory
Approvals, neither the Buyer nor any of the Sellers will, and each of them will
use its reasonable best efforts not to, cause or permit any of its officers,
directors, partners or other Affiliates to, take any action which could
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the submission of any
required filings or notifications or the grant of any such approvals.

              (d) Cooperation. The Sellers and the Buyer (i) shall promptly
inform each other of any communication from any Governmental Authority
concerning this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, and any filing,
notification or request for approval and (ii) shall permit the other party to
review in advance any proposed written communication or information submitted to
any such Governmental Authority in response thereto. In addition, each of the
Sellers and the Buyer shall not agree to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry
with respect to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or any such
filing, notification or request for approval unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent permitted by any such Governmental
Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate
thereat, in each case to the maximum extent practicable. Subject to any
restrictions under applicable laws, rules or regulations, each of the Sellers
and the Buyer shall furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence,
filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof)
between it and its Affiliates and their respective representatives on the one
hand, and the Governmental Authority or members of its staff on the other hand,
with respect to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby (excluding
documents and communications which are subject to preexisting confidentiality
agreements and to the attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine) or any
such filing, notification or request for approval. The Sellers and the Buyer
shall also furnish the other party with such necessary information and
assistance as such other party and its Affiliates may reasonably request in
connection with their preparation of necessary filings, registration, or
submissions of information to the Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby and any such filing,
notification or request for approval. The Sellers and the Buyer shall prosecute
all required requests for approval with all necessary diligence and otherwise
use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the grant thereof by a
Final Order as soon as possible.

         Section 6.7 Tax Matters. (a) Cooperation on Tax Matters. The Buyer and
the Sellers agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon
request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating to
the Business and the Purchased Assets (including access to books and records) as
is reasonably necessary for the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns in
connection with matters relating to or affected by the operations of the Sellers
prior to the Closing, including the making of any election relating to Taxes,
the preparation for any audit by any taxing authority, and the prosecution or
defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the Buyer and the Sellers shall retain all
books and records with respect to Taxes pertaining to the Purchased Assets for a
period of at least six (6) years following the Closing Date. At the end of such
period, each party shall provide the other with at least thirty (30) days prior
written notice before destroying any such books and records, during which period
the party receiving such notice can elect to take possession, at its own
expense, of such books and records. The Sellers and the Buyer shall cooperate
with each other in the conduct of any audit or other proceeding relating to
Taxes involving the Purchased Assets or the Business.

              (b) Transfer Taxes. All excise, sales, use, transfer, value added,
registration, stamp, recording, documentary, conveyancing, franchise, property,
transfer, gains and similar Taxes, levies, charges and recording, filing and
other fees (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Sellers. The
Sellers shall, at their own expense, timely pay and file all necessary Tax
returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes and, if
required by applicable law, the Buyer shall join in the execution of any Tax
Returns and other documentation at the Sellers' request. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Sellers shall seek in the Sale Order a decretal paragraph which
provides that, in accordance with Section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, the
transactions contemplated hereby are steps in the formulation, or anticipation
of the formulation, of a Chapter 11 plan for the Sellers and, as such, the
making or delivery of any instrument of transfer to effectuate the transactions
contemplated hereby shall not be taxed under any law imposing a stamp tax or
similar tax.

                                       19

         Section 6.8 Litigation Support. In the event and for so long as any
party is actively contesting or defending against any action, suit, proceeding,
hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim, or demand in connection with
(a) any transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (b) any fact,
situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan,
occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on or prior
to the Closing Date involving the Sellers, the other party will cooperate with
the contesting or defending party and its counsel in the contest or defense,
make available its personnel, and provide such testimony and access to its books
and records as shall be reasonably necessary in connection with the contest or
defense, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending party.
In the event that the Sale Order is the subject of an appeal, the Buyer and the
Sellers agree to use reasonable best efforts to seek an expedited review and
decision of such appeal and to seek the dissolution of any stay which might be
entered in connection with such an appeal; provided that each party shall bear
the cost of complying with this provision.

         Section 6.9 Notification. The Sellers shall notify the Buyer and keep
it advised of the occurrence, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, of (a) notice of
any litigation or administrative proceeding commenced of threatened in writing
against any Seller which could, if adversely determined, have a Material Adverse
Effect (other than any such action commenced in the Bankruptcy Court) and (b)
any material damage or destruction of any of the Purchased Assets. The Buyer
shall notify the Sellers prior to the Closing Date and keep them advised of the
occurrences of any event or occurrence which could reasonably be expected to
materially adversely affect the Buyer's ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

         Section 6.10 Submission for Bankruptcy Court Approval. (a) In
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Sellers
shall, within one (1) Business Day of the date hereof, file with the Bankruptcy
Court a form of order or orders pursuant to Sections 105, 363, 365 and other
applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code (A) authorizing and approving the

approving the terms of this Agreement, (B) finding the Buyer is acting in good
faith, and is entitled to the protections of a Buyer under Section 363(m) of the
Bankruptcy Code and (C) containing such other findings and provisions as may be
reasonably requested by the Buyer (including a finding that notice of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including notice to all parties to
the Assumed Agreements, has been properly given) in the form and substance of
Exhibit E or otherwise in form and substance acceptable to the Buyer in its sole
discretion (the "Sale Order").

              (b) The Sellers and the Buyer shall each use their reasonable best
efforts, and shall cooperate, assist and consult with each other, to secure the
Bankruptcy Court's approval of (i) the Sale Order no later than one (1) Business
Day after the date of this Agreement and (ii) any other order of the Bankruptcy
Court relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, within
five (5) days following the date of filing of the motion for approval thereof.
The Sellers and the Buyer shall consult with, and seek the advice of, one
another regarding pleadings which any of them intend to file, or positions any
of them intend to take, with the Bankruptcy Court in connection with or which
might reasonably affect, the Bankruptcy Court's approval of the Sale Order. None
of Sellers or the Buyer will file any pleading or take any position that is
inconsistent with obtaining the Bankruptcy Court's approval of the Sale Order or
any other such order. The Sellers shall promptly (and, in any event, within one
(1) Business Day after the receipt of any written request) provide the Buyer and
its counsel with copies of all notices, filings and orders of the Bankruptcy
Court (and other courts) pertaining to the motion for approval of the Sale Order
or any other order relating to any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

              (c) If the Sale Order or any other orders of the Bankruptcy Court
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
appealed by any Person (or if any petition for certiorari or motion for
reconsideration, amendment, clarification, modification, vacation, stay,
rehearing or reargument shall be filed with respect to the Sale Order or other
such order), the Sellers and the Buyer will cooperate in taking such steps
diligently to prosecute such appeal, petition or motion and each of the Seller
and the Buyer shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain an expedited resolution
of any such appeal, petition or motion.

              (d) As a condition to Buyer's obligations hereunder, Sellers have
agreed to pay to Buyer an amount equal to 2.5% of the Cash Payment (the "Topping
Fee") if (i) this Agreement is terminated (other than as a result of a default
by the Buyer in the performance of its obligations hereunder), (ii) the Sellers
shall enter into one or more sale transactions and (iii) such transaction or
transactions shall be consummated and shall close. The Topping Fee shall be paid
when the Sellers receive all of the purchase prices from the other buyers (it
being understood that placing funds in escrow shall not constitute receipt by
the Sellers until such funds are released to the Sellers).

         Section 6.11 D&O Policies. The Sellers shall maintain in effect the D&O
Policies for the benefit of the Sellers' respective current and former directors
and officers until such time as the D&O Policies expire in accordance with their

and its Subsidiaries which currently utilize the name "Winstar" to be changed to
a name that does not include the name "Winstar" or contain any references
thereto and (ii) shall, and shall cause their Affiliates, not to advertise or
hold themselves out as Winstar or an Affiliate thereof. It is expressly
understood and agreed by and between the parties that this covenant shall
survive the Closing and that Buyer shall have all rights and remedies available

                           TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT

         Section 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing Date, unless otherwise stated, by:

              (a) mutual written consent of Winstar (on behalf of the Sellers)
         and the Buyer;

              (b) the Sellers, if there has been a material violation or breach
         by the Buyer of any covenant, representation or warranty made by it
         contained in this Agreement or the Management Agreement which has
         prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of the
         Sellers to effect the Closing;

              (c) the Buyer, if there has been a material violation or breach by
         the Sellers of any covenant made by them in this Agreement or the
         Management Agreement which has prevented the satisfaction of any
         condition to the obligations of the Buyer to effect the Closing.

              (d) the Buyer or the Sellers, if (i) there shall be any law or
         regulation that makes consummation of the transactions contemplated
         hereby illegal or otherwise prohibited or (ii) consummation of the
         transactions contemplated hereby would violate any nonappealable final
         order, decree or judgment of (A) the Bankruptcy Court or (B) any court
         or governmental body having competent jurisdiction;

              (e) the Buyer or the Sellers, if the Sale Order has not been
         entered by the Bankruptcy Court within one (1) Business Day after the
         date hereof; provided that the Buyer or the Sellers, as the case may
         be, shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
         Section 8.1(e) if the failure to obtain such approval within such time
         period results primarily from such party itself breaching any
         representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement;

              (f) the Buyer or the Sellers, if the Sale Order has been stayed,
         vacated, reversed or amended by any court of competent jurisdiction
         (except, as may be modified or amended with the written consent of the
         Sellers and the Buyer, in their sole discretion); and

         occurred on or prior to noon, New York City time, on December 19, 2001
         (the "Termination Date"); provided that the Buyer or the Sellers, as
         the case may be, shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
         pursuant to this Section 8.1(g) if the failure of the Closing to occur
         on or prior to such date results primarily from such party itself
         breaching any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
         Agreement.

         Section 8.2 Procedure and Effect of Termination. In the event of
termination of this Agreement and abandonment of the transactions contemplated
hereby by either or both of the parties pursuant to Section 8.1, written notice
thereof shall forthwith be given by the terminating party to the other party (it
being understood that notice to Winstar shall have the same effect as notice to
all of the Sellers) and this Agreement shall terminate and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be abandoned, without further action by any of the
parties hereto. If this Agreement is terminated as provided herein:

              (a) said termination shall be the sole remedy, subject to Sections
6.10(d) and 8.2(b), of the parties hereto with respect to breaches of any
covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement and none of the
parties hereto nor any of their respective trustees, directors, officers or
Affiliates, as the case may be, shall have any liability or further obligation
to the other party or any of their respective trustees, directors, officers or
Affiliates, as the case may be, pursuant to this Agreement, except for the
parties hereto in each case as stated in this Section 8.2, Section 9.15 and in
Sections 6.2(b) and 6.3; provided, however, the Sellers shall not be responsible
or liable for any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty or covenant by the
Sellers contained in this Agreement prior to the time of such termination;

              (b) the Escrow Amount shall be released to the Buyer or the
Sellers as set forth in the Escrow Agreement;

              (c) all filings, applications and other submissions made pursuant
to this Agreement, to the extent practicable, shall be withdrawn from the agency
or other Person to which they were made; and

              (d) all Confidential Information from any and all of the Sellers
shall be returned to Winstar, and all Confidential Information from the Buyer
shall be returned to the Buyer.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

         Section 9.1 Amendment and Modification. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented only by written agreement of Winstar (on behalf of the
Sellers) and the Buyer.

         Section 9.2 Waiver of Compliance; Consents. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, any failure of any of the parties to comply with any
obligation, covenant or condition herein may be waived by the party entitled to
the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party granting
such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with
such obligation, covenant, or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or
estoppel with respect to any subsequent or other failure.

                                       24

         Section 9.3 Survival. The parties hereto agree that the representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement shall not survive the Closing Date
hereunder, and neither party shall have any liability to the other after the
Closing Date for any breach thereof. The representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement constitute the only representations and warranties made
by the Buyer with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and the
Purchased Assets transferred pursuant hereto, and such representations and
warranties supersede all representations and warranties, written or oral,
previously made by the Buyer. Furthermore, the parties agree that, other than
the right to terminate as contained in Article VIII of this Agreement, neither
party shall have any recourse to the other party, or to any of the officers,
directors, or Affiliates of such party, in the event any of the representations
and warranties made herein or deemed made are untrue as at any time. The only
remedy of the Seller for a breach of such representations and warranties shall
be the Seller's option, under certain circumstances, not to close and to retain
the Purchase Price in accordance with and subject to the limitations in Section
7.1, 7.3, 8.1(b) and 8.2(b). The parties agree that specific performance shall
be available as a remedy to require performance of each party's covenants
contained in this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that only the covenants
contained in this Agreement to be performed at or after the Closing Date shall
survive the Closing hereunder, and each party hereto shall be liable to the
other after the Closing Date for any breach thereof.

         Section 9.4 No Impediment to Liquidation. Subject to Sections 2.2(e),
6.2(c), 6.4 and 6.7, nothing herein shall be deemed or construed as to limit,
restrict or impose any impediment to the Sellers' right to liquidate, dissolve
and wind-up its affairs and to cease all business activities and operations at
such time as it may determine following the Closing, including conversion to
Chapter 7. Subject to Sections 2.2(e), 6.2(c), 6.4 and 6.7, the Sellers shall
not be obligated to retain assets or employees or to continue operations
following the Closing (or to retain outsource assistance) in order to satisfy
its obligations hereunder except to the extent that such would directly
contravene the obligations of the Sellers under this Agreement or the Management
Agreement.

         Section 9.5 Notices. All notices and other communications hereunder
shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (i) when personally
sent/delivered, by facsimile transmission (with hard copy to follow) or sent by
reputable express courier (charges prepaid) or (ii) five (5) days following
mailing by registered or certified mail postage prepaid and return receipt
requested. Unless another address is specified in writing, notices, demands and

         Section 9.6 Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns and with respect to any of the
Sellers, any entity that may succeed to substantially all the assets of such
Seller, but neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any party hereto, including by
operation of law, without the prior written consent of the other party;
provided, however, that the Buyer may assign this Agreement or any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder to any Affiliate provided that Buyer
shall remain liable hereunder. Any assignment of this Agreement or any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder in contravention of this Section 9.6
shall be null and void and shall not bind or be recognized by any of the Sellers
or the Buyer. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Seller may,
subject to applicable law, distribute the Purchase Price, including any IDT
Shares or Buyer Shares to its creditors.

         Section 9.7 Third-Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement shall
be construed as giving any Person, including any counter-party to an Assumed
Agreement, other than the parties hereto, any legal or equitable right, remedy
or claim under or with respect to this Agreement.

         Section 9.8 Severability. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law
or public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

                                       26

         Section 9.9 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable New York principles of
conflicts of law) as to all matters, including but not limited to matters of
validity, construction, effect, performance and remedies.

         Section 9.10 Submission to Jurisdiction. The parties hereto irrevocably
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court (or any court
exercising appellate jurisdiction over the Bankruptcy Court) over any dispute
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other agreement or
instrument contemplated hereby or entered into in connection herewith or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Each party hereby irrevocably
agrees that all claims in respect of such dispute or proceedings may be heard
and determined in such dispute or proceedings may be heard and determined in
such courts. The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have
to the laying of venue of any such dispute brought in such court or any defense
of inconvenient forum in connection therewith.

         Section 9.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which, when executed
and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

         Section 9.12 Incorporation of Schedule and Exhibits. The Disclosure
Schedule and all Exhibits attached hereto and referred to herein are hereby
incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this Agreement for all
purposes as if fully set forth herein.

         Section 9.13 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Exhibits
and the Disclosure Schedule) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the parties with respect
thereto.

         Section 9.14 Headings. The descriptive headings contained in this
Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in
any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

         Section 9.15 Remedies. Subject to Section 9.3, the Sellers and the
Buyer hereby acknowledge and agree that money damages may not be an adequate
remedy for any breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this
Agreement and that, in such event, the Sellers or their successors or assigns,
or the Buyer or its successors or assigns, as the case may be, may, in addition
to any other rights and remedies existing in their favor, apply to the
Bankruptcy Court for specific performance, injunctive and/or other relief in
order to enforce or prevent any violations of this Agreement.

         Section 9.16 Bulk Sales or Transfer Laws. The Buyer hereby waives
compliance by the Sellers with the provisions of the bulk sales or transfer laws
of all applicable jurisdictions.
