(w) any gap in the chain of title unless affirmative evidence shows that there
is a superior chain of title by an abstract of title, title opinion or
landmans title chain or runsheet;

(x) any Lien or loss of title resulting from Sellers conduct of business in
compliance with this Agreement;

(y) any defect that affects only which Person has the right to receive
Royalty payments (rather than the amount of such Royalty) and that does not
affect the validity of the underlying Acquired Property, and to the extent the
same does not (1) reduce Sellers Net Revenue Interests in the applicable
Acquired Property below that shown in _Exhibit A-1_, _Exhibit A-2_ or
_Exhibit A-3_ or (2) obligates Seller to bear a Working Interest for any
Acquired 

 



13  Property above the percentage shown in Exhibit A _-1_ , _Exhibit A-2_ or
_Exhibit A-3_ for such Acquired Property unless the Net Revenue Interest for
such Acquired Property is greater than the Net Revenue Interest set forth on
Exhibit A _-1_ , _Exhibit A-2_ or _Exhibit A-3_ for such Acquired Property in
the same proportion as any increase in such Working Interest

 

(z) the failure to obtain any permits, easements, rights-of-way, pooling
agreements or authorizations, unit designations or production or drilling
units not yet obtained, formed or created with respect to undeveloped
locations that have not been spudded;

estate of any lessor unless a complaint of foreclosure has been filed or any
similar action taken by the mortgagee thereunder and, in such case, such
mortgage has not been subordinated to the Acquired Interests affected
thereby.

5.3 _Title Defect_. " _Title Defect_ " means any individual
Lien, encroachment, irregularity, defect in, or objection to title of the
Seller to any individual Acquired Interest, Lands, Acquired Well, or any other
individual interest in real property or personal property separately described
on Exhibit C that alone or in combination with other defects renders title to
such individual Acquired Interest, Lands, Acquired Well, or any other interest
in real property or personal property separately described on Exhibit C less
than Defensible Title as of 5:00 p.m., Houston, Texas, time on the Business
Day immediately before the Defect Notice Deadline.

5.4 _Title Defect Value_. " _Title Defect Value_ " means, with respect to an
Asset, the reduction in such Assets Allocated Value as of 5:00 p.m., Houston,
Texas, time on the Business Day immediately before the Defect Notice Deadline
caused by an uncured Title Defect with respect to such Asset, taking into
account the nature of the Title Defect and any subsequent cure of such Title
Defect by the Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (a) in determining the
Title Defect Value, the reduction in the Assets value shall be based on the
Allocated Value; (b) the Title Defect Value shall not exceed the cost to cure
the related Title Defect (if the cost to cure is reasonably determinable); (c)
the aggregate amount of Title Defect Values attributable to all Title Defects
affecting an Asset shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Asset; (d)
subject to the foregoing, if a Title Defect is a Lien that is undisputed and
liquidated in amount, the Title Defect Value shall be the amount necessary to
be paid to remove the Lien; and (e) if a Title Defect affects an Asset for
less than its full productive life, the Title Defect Value shall be reduced to
take into account the applicable time period only.

5.5 _Title Defects Notices_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall give Seller written notice of any Title Defect that
Purchaser intends to assert in its Notice of Title Defects promptly after
discovery.

(b) On or before 5:00 p.m., Houston, Texas time, on August 17, 2012 (the "
_Defect Notice Deadline_ "), Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a written
notice (a " _Notice of Title Defects_ ") that sets forth all Title Defects
affecting the Assets that Purchaser desires to assert under this Agreement
and all Interest Additions discovered by Purchaser or of which Purchaser has
been notified under _Section 5.9_. The Notice of Title Defects shall, with
respect

 



14  to each such Title Defect or Interest Addition set forth therein: (i)
describe such Title Defect or Interest Addition and the Assets affected
thereby; (ii) describe the basis of such Title Defect or Interest Addition;
(iii) include documentation supporting the basis of such Title Defect or
Interest Addition; (iv) in the case of a Title Defect, describe in general
terms the curative actions that Purchaser reasonably anticipates are required
to cure such Title Defect; (v) in the case of each Title Defect, describe
Purchasers good faith estimate of the Title Defect Value with respect to each
Asset affected by such Title Defect in accordance with and subject to the
limitations in _Section 5.4_ (" _Purchaser s Title Defect Value_"); and (vi)
in the case of each Interest Addition, describe Purchasers good faith
estimate of the value of such Interest Addition.

5.6 _Waiver; Cure; Adjustment; Deductible_.

 

(a) _Waiver_. Without limitation of Purchasers rights under the special
warranty of title in the Assignment and with respect to a breach by Seller of
_Section 10.1_, _10.2_ , a Title Defect shall be and is hereby conclusively
waived by Purchaser, Purchaser shall not be entitled to any adjustment for
such Title Defect or to exclude the Asset affected by such Title Defect, and
Seller shall not be obligated to cure such Title Defect, if: (i) Purchaser
fails to provide written notice to Seller of such Title Defect in accordance
with _Section 5.5(b)_ on or before the Defect Notice Deadline; (ii) the
Title Defect Value with respect to such Title Defect is less than the Title
Defect Threshold; or (iii) the Allocated Value of the Asset affected by such
Title Defect is less than the Title Defect Threshold. 

(b) _Cure_. Seller shall have the right and option, but not the obligation to
attempt to cure and to cure any Title Defects that are not waived under
_Section 5.6(a)_ on or before the Closing Date. Except in the case that
Seller and Purchaser agree under _Section 5.8_ on the Title Defect Values for
all Open Title Defects (excluding those that have been waived or previously
cured under this _Section 5.6_), then Seller shall have an additional period
from and after the Closing Date to the Final Settlement Date to attempt to
cure and to cure, at its sole expense, any such Title Defects and with the
notice to Purchaser to include reasonable detail concerning the actions which
Seller proposes to take and documentation which Seller proposes to acquire in
order to cure such defect. A Title Defect that is not waived under _Section
5.6(a)_ or cured under this _Section 5.6(b)_ is referred to in this Agreement
as an " _Unwaived/Uncured Title Defect._ " An Unwaived/Uncured Title Defect
that is not an Indemnified Title Defect is referred to in this Agreement as a
" _Surviving Title Defect._ "

(c) _Adjustment; Deductible_. Purchaser shall be entitled to a downward
adjustment to the Base Purchase Price in the amount, if any (the " _Title
Defect Adjustment_ "), by which: (i) the difference of the following (the "
_Net Aggregate Defect Value_ "): (A) the sum of the Title Defect Values with
respect to all Surviving Title Defects; _minus_ (B) the sum of the value of
all Interest Additions; _exceeds_ (ii) the Title Defect Deductible. If, after
taking into account the provisions of this _Article 5_, the Title Defect
Deductible is equal to or greater than the Net Aggregate Defect Value, then
Purchaser shall not be entitled to a Title Defect Adjustment. In no event
shall any Acquired Assets be excluded from the Contemplated Transactions
arising out of or relating to any Title Defects.

 

5.7 _Indemnification for Title Defects_.

 

(a) _Election_. At any time after the delivery by Purchaser of its Notice of
Title Defects and before the Final Settlement Date, Seller may (but shall not
be obligated to) make an election by written notice to Purchaser to indemnify,
defend, save, and hold harmless

 



15  Purchaser under _Section 16.2(a)(iv)_ (subject to the other provisions of
this _Section 5.7_ and _Article 16_ ) for all Claims and Losses arising out
of, attributable to, or in connection with one or more particular Title
Defects alleged by Purchaser in its Notice of Title Defects (each, an "
_Indemnified Title Defect_ "). Purchaser shall not be entitled to a downward
adjustment to the Purchase Price with respect to any alleged Title Defect
with respect to which Seller elects to indemnify Purchaser pursuant to this
_Section 5.7(a)_.

(b) _Limitations on Losses_.

(i) The amount of any Loss or Claim arising out of, attributable to, or in
connection with each Indemnified Title Defect must exceed the Title Defect
Deductible before Seller shall have any Liability or obligation under this
_Section 5.7_ or  _Section 16.2(a)(iv)_ with respect to such Loss or Claim,
and if such Loss or Claim exceeds the Title Defect Deductible, the obligation
of Seller to indemnify Purchaser under this _Section 5.7_ and _Section
16.2(a)(iv)_ for such Loss or Claim shall apply from the first dollar of such
Loss _in excess of the Title Defect Deductible_.

(ii) The aggregate Liability of Seller for all Losses and Claims arising out
of, attributable to, or in connection with all Indemnified Title Defects shall
not exceed the difference of: (A) the aggregate sum of Purchasers Title
Defect Values with respect to such Indemnified Title Defects; minus (B) the
Title Defect Deductible.

(iii) The aggregate Liability of Seller for all Losses and Claims arising out
of, attributable to, or in connection with any particular Indemnified Title
Defect shall not exceed Purchasers Title Defect Value with respect to such
Indemnified Title Defect.

5.8 _Agreement on Title Defects and Interest Additions_.

(a) _Attempt to Agree_. With respect to each Title Defect that is not an
Indemnified Title Defect and that the Parties do not agree has been waived or
cured under _Section 5.6_ (each, an " _Open Title Defect_ ") and each
Interest Addition, from the receipt by Seller of Purchasers Notice of
Title Defects until the Final Settlement Date or the earlier acknowledgement
of Purchaser in writing that it is not entitled to a Title Defect Adjustment,
Purchaser and Seller shall attempt in good faith to agree on the existence and
associated Title Defect Value of each such Open Title Defect, and the
existence and associated value of each such Interest Addition.

(b) _Agreement_. If Seller and Purchaser agree on the existence and Title
Defect Value of any such Open Title Defect, then the Title Defect Value for
such Open Title Defect shall be the agreed Title Defect Value for purposes of
determining the Title Defect Adjustment, if any. If Seller and Purchaser agree
on the existence and value of any Interest Addition, then the value of such
Interest Addition shall be the agreed upon value for purposes of determining
the Title Defect Adjustment, if any. Upon any such agreement, Seller and
Purchaser shall execute a written instrument reflecting such agreement.

(c) _Agreement Before Closing_. If, before the Closing Date, Seller and
Purchaser agree on the existence and Title Defect Values of all Open Title
Defects, and the existence and value of all Interest Additions, then the
amount of the Title Defect Adjustment, if any, shall be deducted from the Base
Purchase Price at the Closing, and shall be reflected in the Closing Amount.

 



16 (d) _Failure to Agree_. If, before the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser do
not agree on the existence and Title Defect Values of all Open Title Defects,
and the existence and value of all Interest Additions, then: (i) the existence
and Title Defect Value of those Open Title Defects that are not agreed (but
only those that are not agreed), and the existence and value of those Interest
Additions that are not agreed (but only those that are not agreed), shall be
Title Disputed Matters settled by the Title Expert under _Section
5.10_; (ii) there shall be no adjustment to the Closing Amount or exclusion
of Assets for any such Open Title Defects or Interest Additions; and (iii) the
Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward pursuant to the final
settlement under  _Section 14.1_ by the amount of the Title Defect
Adjustment, if any, based on the Title Defect Values of any Surviving Title
Defects, and the values of any Interest Additions, in each case determined
under this _Section 5.8_ or  _Section 5.10_, as applicable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such Surviving Title Defects that are cured by Seller
under _Section 5.6(b)_ before the Final Settlement Date shall not be
considered Surviving Title Defects and shall be and are hereby waived.

5.9 _Interest Additions_.

 

(a) _Notice of Interest Additions_. If prior to the Defect Notice Deadline,
Purchaser or Seller discovers any additional interests in the Assets that are
not listed in _Exhibit A_ , including any interest that entitles Seller to
receive more than the Net Revenue Interest with respect to any such Asset set
forth in _Exhibit A-2_ , or obligates Seller to bear costs and expenses in an
amount less than the Working Interest with respect to any such Asset set forth
in _Exhibit A-2_ , and assuming no corresponding reduction in the Net Revenue
Interest (each an " _Interest Addition_ "), the discovering Party shall
promptly after discovery (but in any event prior to the Defect Notice
Deadline), provide written notice to the other Party of such Interest
Addition. Such notice shall be in writing and shall include: (i) a
description of each such Interest Addition; (ii) the basis for each such
Interest Addition, and supporting documentation with respect thereto; (iii)
the Assets and the Allocated Value of the Assets affected by each
such Interest Addition; and (iv) the value of the Interest Addition or the
amount by which the notifying Party reasonably believes the Allocated Value of
the affected Assets should be increased by the Interest Addition, and the
computations upon which such Partys belief is based.

(b) _Effect of Interest Additions_. There shall be no increase to the
Purchase Price as a result of any Interest Additions. Interest Additions shall
be offset against Title Defect Values in determining the Title Defect
Adjustment, if any, as provided in _Section 5.6(c)_. An Interest Addition
need not be contained in Purchasers Notice of Title Defects to be taken into
account; _provided_ , _however_ , that an Interest Addition shall only be
taken into account if Purchaser has notice or actual knowledge of such
Interest Addition before the Defect Notice Deadline.

(c) _Waiver of Interest Additions_. Subject to Sellers remedies for any
breach by Purchaser, any Interest Addition not raised by Purchaser or Seller
on or prior to the Defect Notice Deadline shall be and is hereby conclusively
waived by Seller.

 

5.10 _Dispute Resolution_. If (1) any Open Title Defects, including the
existence, waiver, cure, and Title Defect Values thereof, or any Interest
Additions, including the existence and values thereof (collectively, " _Title
Disputed Matters_ "), are not agreed upon under _Section 5.8_ and neither
Party has elected to terminate under  _Section 6.8_, then any such Title
Disputed Matters or (2) Purchaser timely delivers a Purchaser Defect
Termination Notice and Seller delivers a Termination Dispute Notice, then any
Unagreed Termination Title Matters, shall, in each case, be resolved by a
single Title Expert under the dispute resolution procedure in this _Section
5.10_.

 



17 (a) _Selection of Expert_. Seller and Purchaser shall act in good faith to
promptly execute such engagement letters and other documents as shall be
necessary to engage the Title Expert within five Business Days after the Final
Settlement Date (or in the case of a Termination Dispute Notice, within five
Business Days after the delivery by Seller of such Termination Dispute
Notice). After the Title Expert has been engaged, if the Title Expert
withdraws after a challenge, dies, or otherwise resigns or is removed, then
such Title Expert shall be replaced within five Business Days thereafter by
Purchaser and Seller in accordance with this _Section 5.10_, and the time
periods in this _Section 5.10_ shall be extended as necessary or appropriate.
The fees and expenses of the Title Expert shall be paid 50% by Seller and 50%
by Purchaser.

(b) _Materials to Title Expert_. Within 20 Business Days after the Final
Settlement Date (or in the case of a Termination Dispute Notice, within 20
Business Days after the delivery by Seller of such Termination Dispute
Notice), the Parties shall provide to the Title Expert the following
materials: 

(i) Purchasers Notice of Title Defects and all documentation provided
therewith or otherwise provided by Purchaser to Seller in connection with any
Open Title Defects or Interest Additions and values with respect thereto (or
in the case of a Termination Dispute Notice, Unagreed Termination Title
Matters);

 

(ii) such evidence as Seller deems appropriate to dispute the existence,
waiver, cure, and alleged Title Defect Values with respect to all Open Title
Defects, and the Interest Additions and values with respect thereto (or in the
case of a Termination Dispute Notice, Unagreed Termination Title Matters), in
each case assigned thereto by Purchaser in its Notice of Title Defects,
together with Sellers good faith estimate of the Title Defect Values with
respect to all such Open Title Defects, if any, and the values with respect to
all such Interest Additions, if any (or in the case of a Termination Dispute
Notice, Unagreed Termination Title Matters); and

(iii) this _Article 5_ , and _Exhibits A-1_ , _A-2_ , _A-3_ , _A-4_ , and _C_
to this Agreement, together with any definitions of terms used in this
_Article 5_ and such Exhibits, but no other provisions of this Agreement.

 

(c) _Decisions of Title Expert_. The Title Expert shall make his or her
determination and provide to the Parties written findings within 20 Business
Days after he has received the materials under _Section 5.10(b)_. The
decision of the Title Expert shall be final and non-appealable and shall be
limited to awarding only Sellers position or Purchasers position with
respect to the Title Disputed Matters associated with each Open Title Defect
and Interest Addition (or in the case of a Termination Dispute Notice, each
Unagreed Termination Title Matter), in each case that are not agreed upon by
the Parties under _Section 5.8_ or _6.8_ , as applicable. The Title Expert
shall make a separate determination with respect to each Open Title Defect and
Interest Addition (or in the case of a Termination Dispute Notice, each
Unagreed Termination Title Matter). The written finding of the Title Expert
shall only set forth the Title Experts decision with respect to each
applicable Open Title Defect and Interest Addition (or in the case of a
Termination Dispute Notice, each Unagreed Termination Title Matter), and not
the Title Experts rationale for the decision. The Title Expert shall not make
any other award or grant any other remedy, whether or not 

 



18  prohibited or contemplated by this Agreement, and shall certify, as
necessary, the resolution of such Title Disputed Matters (or in the case of a
Termination Dispute Notice, such Unagreed Termination Title Matters), as
applicable, to the Accounting Referee under _Section 14.1_.

5.11 _Changes in Prices; Well Events_. Without prejudice to Purchasers
rights under any provisions pertaining to Casualty Losses, with respect to
operational covenants and with respect to Sellers obligations under _Sections
10.1_ and  _10.10_ , Purchaser shall assume all risk of Loss with respect to:
(a) changes in commodity or product prices and any other market factors or
conditions from and after the Effective Time; (b) production declines or any
adverse change in the production characteristics or downhole condition of an
Acquired Well, including any Acquired Well watering out, or experiencing a
collapse in the casing or sand infiltration, from and after the Execution
Date; and (c) depreciation of any Acquired Assets that constitute personal
property through ordinary wear and tear, and none of the foregoing shall
constitute Title Defects or otherwise give rise to any Claims by Purchaser
before, on, or after the Closing.

 

5.12 _Exclusive Remedy_. EXCEPT AS TO ANY BREACHES OF THE COVENANTS SET FORTH
IN _SECTION 10.1_ OR _SECTION 10.2_ OR SELLERS SPECIAL WARRANTY OF TITLE SET
FORTH IN THE ASSIGNMENTS DELIVERED HEREUNDER, THIS ARTICLE 5 SHALL, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BE THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT AND REMEDY
OF PURCHASER WITH RESPECT TO TITLE DEFECTS AND OTHER DEFICIENCIES IN TITLE
WITH RESPECT TO THE ACQUIRED ASSETS. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE 5,
PURCHASER RELEASES, REMISES, AND FOREVER DISCHARGES SELLER AND ITS AFFILIATES
AND ITS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE STOCKHOLDERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES,
AGENTS, ADVISORS, AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM ANY AND ALL SUITS, LEGAL OR
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS,
LIABILITIES, INTEREST, OR CAUSES OF ACTION WHATSOEVER, IN LAW OR IN EQUITY,
KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, WHICH PURCHASER MIGHT NOW OR SUBSEQUENTLY MAY HAVE, BASED
ON, RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF, ANY TITLE DEFECT OR OTHER DEFICIENCY IN
TITLE TO ANY ASSET.

the possession or control of Purchaser or any of Purchasers Entity
Representatives. Any physical disturbance to the Assets (including the
leasehold associated therewith) resulting from Purchasers due diligence will
be promptly corrected by Purchaser.

Obligations; and (z) the presence or absence of naturally occurring
radioactive material, radon gas and asbestos ("NORM") in or on the Acquired
Assets.

 

6.3 _Environmental Defect Value_. " _Environmental Defect Value_ " means, with
respect to an Environmental Defect, the amount of the Liability and the
estimated costs and expenses of Seller (in both cases based on the reasonable
proportionate cost to Seller) to Remediate or otherwise cure such

applicable, to the satisfaction of the applicable Governmental Authorities.

 

6.4 _Environmental Defect Notices_.

(whether or not Purchaser intends to assert such Environmental Defect in its
Notice of Environmental Defects) promptly (but in any event prior to the
Defect Notice Deadline).

(a) _Waiver_. An Environmental Defect shall be and is hereby conclusively
waived by Purchaser, Purchaser shall not be entitled to any remedies or
adjustment for such Environmental Defect or to exclude the Acquired Asset
affected by such Environmental Defect, and Seller shall not be obligated to
cure such Environmental Defect, if: (i) Purchaser fails to provide written
notice to Seller of such Environmental Defect in accordance with _Section
6.4(b)_ on or before the Defect Notice Deadline; or (ii) the Environmental

previously cured under this _Section 6.5_), then Seller shall have an
additional period from and after the Closing Date to the Final Settlement
Date to attempt to Remediate or otherwise cure, and to Remediate or otherwise
cure, any such Environmental Defects. An Environmental Defect that is not
waived under _Section 6.5(a)_ or Remediated or otherwise cured under this 
_Section 6.5(b)_ is referred to in this Agreement as an " _Unwaived/Uncured
Environmental Defect._ " An Unwaived/Uncured Environmental Defect that is not
an Indemnified Environmental Defect is referred to in this Agreement as a "
_Surviving Environmental Defect._ "

(c) _Adjustment; Deductible_. Purchaser shall be entitled to a downward
adjustment to the Base Purchase Price in the amount, if any (the "
_Environmental Defect Adjustment_ "), by which: (i) the sum of the
Environmental Defect Values with respect to all Surviving Environmental
Defects; _exceeds_ (ii) the Environmental Defect Deductible. If, after taking
into account the provisions of this _Article 6_ , the Environmental Defect
Deductible is equal to or greater than the sum of the Environmental Defect
Values with respect to all Surviving Environmental Defects, then Purchaser
shall not be entitled to an Environmental Defect Adjustment.

6.6 _Indemnification for Environmental Defects_.

(a)  _Election_. At any time after the delivery by Purchaser of its Notice of
Environmental Defects and before the Closing Date, Seller may (but shall not
be obligated to) make an election by written notice to Purchaser to indemnify,

Defects (each, an " _Indemnified Environmental Defect_ ").

 

(b) _Limitations on Losses_.

 

(i) The amount of any Loss or Claim arising out of, attributable to, or in
connection with each Indemnified Environmental Defect must exceed the
Environmental Defect Deductible before Seller shall have any Liability or
obligation under this _Section 6.6_ or _Section 16.2(a)(v)_ with respect to
such Loss or Claim, and if such Loss or Claim exceeds the Environmental
Defect Deductible, the obligation of Seller to indemnify Purchaser under this
_Section 6.6_ and _Section 16.2(a)(v)_ for such Loss or Claim shall apply
from the first dollar of such Loss or Claim in excess of the Environmental
Defect Deductible.

(ii) The aggregate Liability of Seller for all Losses and Claims arising out
of, attributable to, or in connection with all Indemnified Environmental
Defects shall not exceed the difference of: (A) the aggregate sum of
Purchasers Environmental Defect Values with respect to such Indemnified
Environmental Defects; minus (B) the Environmental Defect Deductible.

(iii) The aggregate Liability of Seller for all Losses and Claims arising out
of, attributable to, or in connection with any particular Indemnified
Environmental Defect shall not exceed Purchasers Environmental Defect Value
with respect to such Indemnified Environmental Defect.

 

6.7 _Agreement on Environmental Defects_.

 

(a) _Attempt to Agree_. With respect to each Environmental Defect that is not
an Indemnified Environmental Defect and that the Parties do not agree has
been waived or Remediated or otherwise cured under _Section 6.5_ (each, an "
_Open Environmental Defect_ "), from the receipt by Seller of Purchasers
Notice of Environmental Defects until the Closing Date or the earlier
acknowledgement of Purchaser in writing that it is not entitled to an
Environmental Defect Adjustment, Purchaser and Seller shall attempt in good
faith to agree on the existence and associated Environmental Defect Value of
each such Open Environmental Defect.

(b) _Agreement_. If Seller and Purchaser agree on the existence and
Environmental Defect Value of any such Open Environmental Defect, then the
Environmental Defect Value for such Open Environmental Defect shall be the
agreed Environmental Defect Value for purposes of determining the
Environmental Defect Adjustment, if any. Upon any such agreement, Seller and
Purchaser shall execute a written instrument reflecting such agreement.

(c) _Agreement Before Closing_. If, before the Closing Date, Seller and
Purchaser agree on the existence and Environmental Defect Values of all Open
Environmental Defects, then the amount of the Environmental Defect

appraisal of the extent and value of the Hydrocarbon and other reserves
attributable to the Acquired Assets and the prices that may be received for
Hydrocarbons produced from the Acquired Assets.

(d) Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Indemnified Seller
Parties shall not have any Liability to Purchaser, its Affiliates, any
Indemnified Purchaser Parties, or their respective Entity Representatives,
arising out of or resulting from any authorized or unauthorized use,
disclosure, or reliance on the Background Materials or other information and
data relating to the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities provided by or
on behalf of Seller or any other Indemnified Seller Party.

9.10 _Securities Laws_. Purchaser has such knowledge, sophistication, and
experience in business and financial matters and in the ownership and
operation of oil and gas properties and assets that Purchaser is capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of the acquisition of the Acquired Assets, and
has so evaluated the merits and risks of such acquisition. Purchaser is able
to bear the economic risk of its acquisition of the Acquired Assets, and, at
the present time, is able to afford a complete loss of such investment. The
Acquired Assets are being acquired by Purchaser for Purchasers own account
for the purpose of investment or consumption and not with a view to reselling
or distributing the Acquired Assets in violation of any registration or
qualification requirements of any securities Laws. Purchaser understands and
acknowledges that neither the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
nor any federal, state or foreign agency has passed upon the Acquired Assets
or made any finding or determination as to the fairness of an investment in
the Acquired Assets or the accuracy or adequacy of the disclosures made to
Purchaser, and, except as expressly set forth in _Article 12_ , Purchaser
waives its right of rescission and is not entitled to cancel, terminate, or
revoke this Agreement.

9.11 _Qualification_. Purchaser is now or at the Closing will be
and thereafter will continue to be qualified to own and operate the Acquired
Assets, including the federal, state, and fee Acquired Leases, including
meeting all Permit, bonding, and other surety requirements. Consummation of
the Contemplated Transactions by Purchaser will not cause Purchaser to be
disqualified or to exceed any acreage limitations imposed by Law.

 



32 9.12 _Financial Resources_. Purchaser will, at the Closing, have the
financial resources necessary to close the Contemplated Transaction and
perform all obligations of Purchaser hereunder and under the Agreements
executed by Purchaser in connection with the Contemplated Transaction.

 

9.13 _Guarantor Representations_. Guarantor represents and warrants to Seller
as of the Execution Date and as of the Closing as follows:

(a) Guarantor is a corporation that is validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of the State of Delaware.

(b) Guarantor has the full organizational power and authority to carry on its
business as presently conducted, to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its obligations under this Agreement, and to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions.

(c) The execution and delivery by Guarantor of this Agreement, and the
performance by Guarantor of its obligations under this Agreement, have been
duly authorized by all necessary organizational action of Guarantor,
including any required board of director, stockholder, and other
authorizations or approvals under the Entity Law applicable to, or the
Organizational Documents of, Guarantor.

 

(d) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Guarantor, and
constitutes the legal, valid, and binding obligation of Guarantor,
enforceable against Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except to the
extent that such enforceability may be subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other similar Laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors rights generally, and to general equitable
principles.

(e) This Agreement, when executed and delivered by Guarantor, will have been
duly executed and delivered by Guarantor, and will constitute the legal,
valid, and binding obligation of Guarantor, enforceable against Guarantor in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that such enforceability may
be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
or other similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally
and to general equitable principles.

 

(f) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the ability of Guarantor to comply with its obligations hereunder,
the execution, delivery, and performance by Guarantor of this Agreement does
not: (a) result in a violation or breach of any Law or Order that is binding
on Guarantor or any of Guarantors material assets or properties; (b)
contravene or result in a violation of any provision of the Organizational
Documents of Guarantor; or (c) constitute a default or an event of default
under, require any filing, notice, waiver, consent, authorization,
or approval under, or result in or give any third party any right of
termination, cancellation, or acceleration of the obligations under, any
material contract or agreement to which Guarantor is a party or to which its
assets are bound.

33  Commercially Reasonable Efforts to operate and maintain the Acquired Assets
that are operated by Seller, in the ordinary course of business and consistent
with Sellers past practice; (ii) except as provided in _clause (iii)_ below

interest terminates pursuant to its existing term, and (B) material Easements
and material Permits held by it and issued by any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Acquired Asset, (in each case) except where any such Easement
or Permit terminates pursuant to its existing terms or where a reasonably
prudent operator would not maintain the same; and, (vii) give prompt written
notice to Purchaser upon obtaining knowledge of any material damage to or
destruction of any of the Acquired Assets.

(b) _Upon Closing_. Upon the Closing, without prejudice to Purchasers rights
under the remaining provisions of this Agreement, Purchaser shall assume full
Liability and responsibility for all Operations of Seller with respect to the
Acquired Assets; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in this

will become the operator of all or any portion of the Acquired Assets under
any applicable joint operating agreements, as such will be controlled by the
applicable joint operating agreements.

10.2 _Restriction on Operations_. Subject to  _Section 10.1_ and to the
provisions of applicable operating agreements and other applicable contracts

affecting the Acquired Assets; or (d) materially amend, modify, or terminate,
or waive any material provision under, any Acquired Lease or Material Contract
(other than a termination or waiver pursuant to the terms of such Acquired
Lease or Material Contract without any further affirmative action or conduct
by Seller).

 



34 Requests for approval of any action restricted by this _Section 10.2_ (and

shall have full authority to grant or deny such requests for approval on
behalf of Purchaser:

(unless a shorter time is reasonably required by the circumstances and such
shorter time is specified in Sellers notice) of Sellers notice to Purchaser
requesting such consent unless Purchaser notifies Seller to the contrary
during that period. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller owns undivided
interests in the Assets, and Purchaser agrees that the acts or omissions of
third parties (including the applicable operators of the Assets) who are not
Affiliates of Seller shall not constitute a violation of the provisions of
this _Section 10.2_ (or  _Section 10.1(a)(iii)_), nor shall any action
required by a vote of working interest owners constitute such a violation so
long as Seller and its Affiliates have voted their respective interests in a
manner consistent with the provisions of this _Section 10.2_.

10.3 _Marketing_. From the Execution Date until the Closing, without the
prior written consent of Purchaser to act otherwise, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, Seller shall not materially

contracts providing for the sale of Hydrocarbons for a term in excess of one
month that cannot be cancelled or terminated on 60 days or less notice.

 

10.4 _Legal Status_. From the Execution Date until the Final Settlement Date,
Seller and Purchaser shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
preserve and maintain its legal status and to assure that, as of the Closing
Date, it will not be subject to any material Entity, legal, or contractual
restriction that would prohibit or delay the timely consummation of
the Contemplated Transactions.

10.5 _Notices of Claims_. Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser, and
Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller, if, at any time from the Execution
Date until the Closing, Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, receives
notice of any Claim or Proceeding of the type described in _Section 8.8_ or
_Section 9.8_. 

10.6 _Compliance with Laws_. From the Execution Date until the Closing, Seller
shall attempt in good faith to comply in all material respects with all
applicable Laws, Permits, and Orders relating to the ownership of the Acquired
Assets, and, to the extent that Seller is the operator of any such Acquired
Assets, the operation of such Acquired Assets. 

10.7 _Limitation on Seller s Interim Obligations_. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary or otherwise expanding any obligations that Seller may
have to Purchaser, Seller shall not have any Liability, obligation or
responsibility to Purchaser for any Claims, Losses or Liabilities, including
Claims, Liabilities or Losses attributable to or arising out of personal
injury, death, or property damage, relating to, attributable to or resulting
from any breach of any covenant of Seller set forth in _Sections 10.1(a)(i)_ ,
_10.1(a)(ii)_ , _10.1(a)(vi)_ , _10.2(b)_ or _10.6 _ except to the extent any
such claims, damages, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses, including
claims, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses attributable to personal
injury, death, or property damage, are the direct result of the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller.

 



35 10.8 _Governmental Reviews and Filings_.

 

(a) _Before Closing_. From and after the Execution Date until the Closing, the
Parties shall cooperate to provide all information requested by, make all
required filings with, prepare and submit all required applications to, and
conduct all negotiations required or requested by, any Governmental Authority
as may be required to consummate the Contemplated Transactions.

(b) _HSR Act_. Without limiting _Section 10.8(a)_, if filings pursuant to
and under the HSR Act are required in connection with the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions, Seller and Purchaser shall promptly (and in no
event later than 10 Business Days) after the Execution Date compile and file
(or will cause their " _ultimate parent entity_ " (as determined for purposes
of the HSR Act) to file) under the HSR Act such information with respect to
such Party as the HSR Act requires. To the extent permitted by Law, the
Parties shall cooperate and consider in good faith the views of the other
Parties in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions, and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any Party in connection with Proceedings under or relating to
the HSR Act, including as to whether any HSR Act filings are required. To the
extent HSR Act filings are required, each Party shall use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to take such actions as may be required to cause the
expiration or termination of the notice periods under the HSR Act with respect
to the Contemplated Transactions as promptly as possible after making such
initial filings. Purchaser shall bear and promptly reimburse Seller for any
and all fees and payments incurred by Seller payable to any Governmental
Authorities under the HSR in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.

(c) _After Closing_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 10.9_, after
the Closing, Purchaser shall, at is sole cost and expense, make all required
filings with, obtain all required consents, approvals, authorizations, and
Permits from, and prepare and submit all applications to, any Governmental
Authorities as may be required to transfer title to the Acquired Assets to
Purchaser, to comply with Laws, and to further consummate the Contemplated
Transactions, and shall indemnify, defend, save, and hold harmless the
Indemnified Seller Parties from and against all Claims arising out of
Purchasers holding of title to the Acquired Assets after the Closing and
before the securing of any necessary Permits, bonds, other surety
arrangements, consents, approvals, and authorizations required under Law with
respect to such transfer. After the Closing, Seller shall reasonably cooperate
with Purchaser in making, preparing, submitting, and obtaining the filings,
consents, approvals, authorizations, Permits, and applications to be made,
prepared, submitted, or obtained by Purchaser under this _Section 10.8(c)_.

 

10.9 _Material Required Consents_.

(a) From and after the Execution Date until Closing, Seller shall use its
Commercially Reasonable Efforts (but in no event required to make any payments
or incur any material obligations owed to any Person), with reasonable
assistance from Purchaser (including Purchaser providing required assurances
of financial condition and operator qualifications), to obtain all Material
Required Consents before the Closing. Purchaser shall bear and be liable for,
and the Assumed Liabilities shall include, any payments or obligations owed by
any Party or Indemnified Seller Party to any Person other than a Party in
connection with obtaining any material Required Consents or other consents
(other than under the HSR Act).

 



36 (b) If, during the course of Purchasers Due Diligence Review, Purchaser
discovers any Material Required Consent that is not listed in _Section 8.1 of
the Disclosure Schedule_, Purchaser shall promptly after discovery give
written notice to Seller of such Material Required Consent, and  _Section
8.1 of the Disclosure Schedule_ shall be deemed updated by the Material
Required Consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the failure to obtain a Material Required Consent before the Closing or to
list a Material Required Consent on _Section 8.1 of the Disclosure Schedule_
shall not constitute a breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant in
this Agreement.

 

(c) If a Material Required Consent is not obtained before the Closing: (i)
until the Final Settlement Statement is agreed upon, Seller and Purchaser
shall work together in good faith to obtain such Material Required Consent
(including, in the case of Purchaser, providing required assurance of
financial condition and operator qualifications); (ii) neither this Agreement
nor any other Transaction Document shall constitute an actual or attempted
sale, assignment, assumption, transfer, conveyance, or delivery of the
Acquired Assets or Assumed Liabilities subject to the Material Required
Consent; (iii) until any such Material Required Consent is obtained, the
Parties shall cooperate with each other in any reasonable and lawful
arrangements designed to provide to Purchaser the benefits of the Acquired
Assets and the burdens of the Assumed Liabilities subject to the Material
Required Consent. Promptly after any such Material Required Consent is
obtained, Seller shall assign, transfer, and convey to Purchaser, and
Purchaser shall assume from Seller, the Acquired Asset or Assumed Liabilities
covered by the Material Required Consent pursuant to special-purpose
assignment and assumption documents substantially consistent with the
Transaction Documents and (iv) if before the Final Settlement Statement is
agreed upon, a Material Required Consent has not been obtained then that
portion of the Acquired Assets affected by such Material Required Consent
shall thereafter remain excluded as described in _Section 10.9(c)(ii)_ and
any of the Allocated Value or other costs, Property Expenses, income proceeds
or other adjustments previously accounted for with respect to such Assets
shall be accounted for in the Final Settlement Statement.

 

10.10 _Preferential Purchase Rights_.

 

(a) _Compliance with Preferential Rights_. Seller shall use its Commercially
Reasonable Efforts (but in no event required to make any payments or incur
any material obligations owed to any Person) to comply with any Preferential
Rights by sending written notice of this Agreement, within five Business Days
after the Execution Date, to all Persons holding any such Preferential Rights
set forth on _Section 8.2 of the Disclosure Schedule_, offering to sell to
each such Person that portion of the Acquired Assets for which such a
Preferential Right is held for an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such
portion of the Acquired Assets.

(b) _Notification_. If, during the course of its Due Diligence Review,
Purchaser discovers any Preferential Right that are not set forth on _Section
8.2 of the Disclosure Schedule_ and which are applicable to the Acquired
Assets, Purchaser shall promptly (but in any event within three Business
Days) after discovery provide written notice to Seller of such Preferential
Right, whereupon Seller shall promptly thereafter comply with such
Preferential Right in accordance with _Section 10.10(a)_.

 

(c) _Consummation Before Closing_. If, before the Closing Date, any
Preferential Right affecting any portion of the Acquired Assets is exercised
and the sale to the holder of such Preferential Right is consummated, then
that portion of the Acquired Assets affected by

 



37  such Preferential Right shall be excluded from the Acquired Assets conveyed
at the Closing, and the Closing Amount shall be adjusted downward by the
Allocated Value of such portion of the Acquired Assets.

(d) _Consummation After Closing_. If, with respect to a Preferential Right
applicable to any portion of the Acquired Assets, either: (x) the time frame
for the exercise of such Preferential Right has not expired before the Closing
Date and Seller has not received from the holder of such Preferential Right
either a notice of such holders intent not to exercise such Preferential
Right or a waiver of such Preferential Right, or (y) the holder of such
Preferential Right timely and properly exercises such Preferential Right
before the Closing Date but the purchase and sale of the affected Acquired
Assets to the holder of such Preferential Right is not consummated before the
Closing Date, then: (i) the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated
Values of the Assets subject to such Preferential Right; (ii) the affected
Acquired Asset shall be retained by Seller at the Closing; and (iii) if the
sale to the holder of the Preferential Right is not consummated before the
Final Settlement Date (including, if the time frame for the exercise of the
Preferential Right expires without exercise before the Final Settlement Date),
then in connection with the final settlement under _Section 14.1_, the Seller
shall convey such Acquired Asset to Purchaser effective as of the
Effective Time pursuant to an assignment and conveyance substantially in the
form of _Exhibit D_ and the Purchase Price shall be increased by the Allocated
Values of such Acquired Assets, subject to such Preferential Right, if still
outstanding as of the Final Settlement Date.

(e) Purchaser acknowledges that Seller desires to sell all of the Acquired
Assets to Purchaser and would not have entered into this Agreement but for
Purchasers agreement to purchase all of the Acquired Assets as herein
provided. Accordingly, it is expressly understood and agreed that Seller does
not desire to sell any Acquired Assets affected by a Preferential Right to
Purchaser unless the sale of all of the Acquired Assets is consummated by the
Closing Date in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In furtherance of
the foregoing, Sellers obligation hereunder to sell the Preference
Properties to Purchaser is expressly conditioned upon the consummation by the
Closing Date of the sale of all of the Acquired Assets (other than Excluded
Assets or other Acquired Assets excluded pursuant to the express provisions
of this Agreement) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, either by
conveyance to Purchaser or conveyance pursuant to an applicable Preferential
Right; provided that, nothing herein is intended or shall operate to
extend or apply any Preferential Right to any portion of the Acquired Assets
that is not otherwise burdened thereby. Time is of the essence with respect to
the Parties agreement to consummate the sale of the Acquired Assets by the
Closing Date. 

10.11 _Casualty Loss_. If, after the Execution Date and before the Closing, a
Casualty Loss occurs with respect to a portion of the Acquired Assets, then,
notwithstanding such Casualty Loss, Purchaser and Seller shall proceed with
the purchase and sale of the affected Acquired Assets without reduction of the
Purchase Price, and Seller shall: (a) pay to Purchaser at the Closing all
sums paid to Seller by Governmental Authorities and third parties before the
Closing by reason of such Casualty Loss; and (b) assign, transfer, and convey
to Purchaser all rights of Seller to any insurance proceeds received by
Seller, as well as all of the right, title, and interest of Seller in and to
any Claims, causes of action, unpaid proceeds, or other payments from
Governmental Authorities or third parties arising out of such Casualty Loss.
Before the Closing, Seller shall not voluntarily compromise, settle, or
adjust any amounts payable by reason of any Casualty Loss without first
obtaining the written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 



38 10.12 _Change of Operator_. Seller and Purchaser each agree to use
their respective Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain all consents,
authorizations, and approvals necessary to cause Purchaser to be elected as
the operator of that portion of the Acquired Assets operated by Seller as of
the Closing Date (provided, however, in no event shall Seller make any
payments or incur any material obligations owed to any Person or liabilities
in connection with obtaining any such consents, authorizations or approvals),
and Purchaser hereby consents and agrees, subject to obtaining such necessary
consents, authorizations, and approvals, to accept the designation,
responsibilities, and Liabilities as the operator of such Acquired Assets.

10.13 _Confidentiality_.

(a) _Confidentiality Agreement_. Unless and until the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Effective
upon the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate
without any further action of the Parties. If this Agreement is terminated
before the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue to remain in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms, and shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

 

(b) _Obligations after Closing_. After the Closing, Purchaser, on the one
hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall not, directly or indirectly,
disclose, or permit any of its Entity Representatives to disclose, to any
third party the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions (including all or any portion of the Purchase
Price) (collectively, " _Confidential Information_ ") without the written
consent of the other Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section
10.13(b)_ shall not prevent disclosure by a Party: (i) pursuant to _Section
10.13(c)_ or _Section 10.14_; (ii) of information that, at the time of
disclosure, is generally available to the public (other than as a result of a
breach of this Agreement (including _Section 10.14_) or any other
confidentiality agreement to which such Party is a party or of which it has
actual knowledge), as evidenced by generally available documents or
publications; (iii) to the extent disclosure is necessary or advisable, to
its Affiliates or to such Partys or any such Affiliates Entity
Representatives for the purpose of performing their respective obligations
under this Agreement; (iv) to banks or other financial institutions or
agencies or any independent accountants or legal counsel or investment
advisors employed by such Party or its Affiliates, to the extent disclosure is
necessary or advisable to obtain financing; (v) to one or more potential
purchasers of the Acquired Assets; (vi) to Governmental Authorities to the
extent necessary to comply with its obligations under this Agreement and Law
with respect to the HSR Act; (vii) as required by applicable securities or
other Laws or the applicable rules of any stock exchange having jurisdiction
over the disclosing Party or its Affiliates; or (viii) to the extent
necessary, to enforce this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in each
case of disclosure under _clauses (iii)_ , _(iv)_ , or  _(v)_ , the Persons
to whom disclosure is made agree to be bound by this confidentiality
provision, and the Party making such disclosure shall be liable and
responsible for any breach by such Person of this confidentiality
obligation. 

(c) _Information Requests_. Notwithstanding _Section 10.13(b)_, if, in the
opinion of a Partys counsel, such Party is required by a Proceeding,
discovery request, Freedom of Information Act (or state equivalent) request,
investigative demand, subpoena, or Order to disclose Confidential Information
(collectively, an " _Information Request_ "), such Party shall give the other
Party at least 10 days prior written notice (unless less time is permitted by
the applicable Information Request, in which case the disclosing Party shall
give as much notice as is possible), together with a copy of the Information
Request. If, before the time such disclosure is required to be made, the other
Party provides the disclosing Party with written

  



39  notice that it intends to object to the Information Request, file a motion
for a protective order, file a motion to quash the Information Request, or
take other legal action to prevent the disclosure of Confidential Information
(collectively, an " _Objection_ "), the disclosing Party shall not produce any
documents or make any disclosures until it receives an Order from the relevant
Governmental Authority, receives written consent from the other Party, or
receives an opinion of legal counsel of the disclosing Party that the
disclosing Party is legally required to comply with the Information Request
despite the pending Objection. Further, the disclosing Party agrees to
cooperate with the other Party, at the request and expense of the other Party,
in filing or obtaining an Objection to ensure confidential treatment of the
Confidential Information. If, after compliance with the foregoing, the
disclosing Party is required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to
such an Information Request, the disclosing Party shall furnish only that
portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be
disclosed, and will cooperate with the other Partys counsel to enable the
other Party, at its sole cost and expense, to obtain any available, reliable
assurance that any Confidential Information so disclosed will be accorded
confidential treatment.

 

10.14 _Public Announcements_.

(a) _Requirements._ Except as provided in _Section 10.14(b)_, neither Seller
nor Purchaser shall issue any press release or make any announcement with
respect to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, without the prior
written consent of the other Party. If any Party intends to issue any press
release or other announcement concerning this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions, such Party shall provide to the other Party a copy of the
proposed announcement as soon as reasonably possible before the disclosure and
shall in good faith consider any comments provided by such other Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right of a Party to provide comments to any
such press release or announcement shall not diminish its right to consent to
such press release or announcement under this _Section 10.14(a)_.

(b) _Limited Exception_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 10.14_, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent a Party
from disclosing the terms or the existence of this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions to the extent such Party determines, upon advice of
counsel, that such disclosure is required or advisable under any securities
Law or listing requirement of any securities exchange applicable to such
Party or any of its equity owners or its or their respective Affiliates;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the disclosing Party shall provide the other
Party with the opportunity to comment as soon as reasonably possible under 
_Section 10.14(a)_ before the disclosure.

10.15 _Required Bonding_. Purchaser shall obtain all required bonds and other
surety arrangements relating to the ownership, use, or operation of the
Acquired Assets (including all bonds and surety arrangements required by the
DOI and the state(s) of Oklahoma and Texas) necessary to cause Sellers and
any of its Affiliates bonds and surety arrangements with respect to the
Acquired Assets to be released at the Closing. Not later than five Business
Days before the Closing, Purchaser shall provide Seller with satisfactory
evidence that all such bonds and surety arrangements have been obtained and
will be unconditionally effective as of the Closing Date.

10.16  _Breach Before Closing_. If, before the Closing, Purchaser obtains
information that leads Purchaser to believe that Seller has or may have
breached any representation, warranty, covenant, or other provision of this
Agreement, Purchaser shall provide notice to Seller of such breach or
potential breach promptly (but in any event within five Business Days) after
discovery or before the Closing, whichever is earlier. If such a notice of
breach or potential breach is delivered under this _Section 10.16_, or if
Seller

 



40  provides written notice to Purchaser of such a breach or potential breach by
Seller, Seller shall have 30 days to cure any such breach, and the Closing
shall be extended as and to the extent necessary (but not more than 30 days)
to permit such cure; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 10.16_ shall
not apply to the willful refusal of Seller to close the Contemplated
Transactions.

 

10.17 _Fulfillment of Conditions_. From and after the Execution Date until the
Closing, each Party shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts, and proceed
diligently and in good faith, to perform and satisfy all representations,
warranties and covenants of such Party contained in this Agreement (to the
extent not inconsistent with this Agreement), and shall not take or fail to
take any action that could reasonably be expected to result in the performance
and fulfillment of any such representations, warranties or covenant.

10.18 _Amendment of Seller s Disclosure Schedules_. Purchaser agrees that,
with respect to the representations and warranties of Seller contained in this
Agreement, Seller shall have the continuing right until the Closing to add,
supplement or amend _Exhibit A-3_ and any of Sellers Disclosure Schedules to
its representations and warranties with respect to any matter hereafter
arising or discovered which, if existing or known at the date of this
Agreement or thereafter, would have been required to be set forth or described
in such Exhibit and Schedules. For all purposes of this Agreement, including
for purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in  _Section
11.3_ have been fulfilled, _Exhibit A-3_ and the Sellers Disclosure Schedules
contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to include only that information
contained therein on the Execution Date and shall be deemed to exclude all
information contained in any addition, supplement or amendment thereto;
provided, however, that if the Closing shall occur, then all matters disclosed
pursuant to any such addition, supplement or amendment at or prior to the

Schedules as of the Execution Date.

10.19  _Employment Matters_.

(a) _Available Employees_. Within ten (10) days of execution of the

and its Affiliates who are directly and exclusively employed full-time in the
operation of the Acquired Assets (collectively, the " _Available Employees_
"), including employees who are receiving short-term disability benefits or
are on family and medical, medical/long-term disability, administrative or
military leave or any other type of leave that entitles the employee
to reinstatement upon completion of the leave under the applicable leave
policies of Seller or its Affiliates (collectively, " _Leave_ "). Such list
shall include for each Available Employee the current job title and work
location (but in no event any base salary, hourly wage rate information or
other compensation information). From the date that the Seller provides
Purchaser the list of Available Employees until five (5) days prior to the
Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates shall cooperate with Purchaser or
Purchasers Affiliates in permitting Purchaser or Purchasers Affiliates to
interview, on a voluntary basis, each Available Employee identified on such
list, so as to make selection decisions and communicate to such employees any

Purchasers Affiliates after the Closing Date.

 

(b) _Employment Offers to Available Employees_. No later than five (5) days
prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser, or Purchasers Affiliates, may, at its
sole discretion, offer employment with Purchaser, or Purchasers Affiliates,
to be effective as of 12:00 a.m. CDT on the day immediately following the
Closing, to those Available Employees that Purchaser or Purchasers
Affiliates select (provided that those Available Employees who are on Leave
shall become employees of the Purchaser or Purchasers Affiliates on the date
of 

 



41  their reinstatement from their Leave). Offers of employment made by
Purchaser or Purchasers Affiliates to Available Employees pursuant to this
_Section 10.19(b)_ shall be under the terms and conditions as determined by
Purchaser and Purchasers Affiliates in their sole discretion; provided that
Purchaser covenants that Purchaser, or Purchasers Affiliates, shall provide
each Available Employee not less than three (3) days in which to accept or
reject Purchasers, or Purchasers Affiliates, employment offer. All
Available Employees who accept employment with Purchaser, or Purchasers
Affiliates, pursuant to the offers described in this _Section 10.19(b)_ and
become employees of the Purchaser or any of the Purchasers Affiliates are
referred to herein as " _Transferred Employees_ ". On the day before the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall notify the Seller as to each Available
Employee who has been offered employment by and accepted employment with the
Purchaser or Purchasers Affiliates as provided herein.

 

(c) _Liabilities for Compensation and Benefits_. Seller or its Affiliates
shall be responsible for the payment of all compensation and benefits and all
other costs and liabilities relating to services provided by any and all
Available Employees while employed by Seller, and Purchaser, or Purchasers
Affiliates, shall assume and be responsible for payment of all compensation
and benefits and all other costs and liabilities relating to services provided
by any Transferred Employees from the date they are employed by Purchaser;
provided that, with respect to an employee on Leave or who otherwise does
not report for active duty with Purchaser or Purchasers Affiliates, such
obligations shall not attach until such employee commences active employment
with Purchaser, or Purchasers Affiliates.

 

10.20 _Contractor Personnel_. Seller shall endeavor to provide to Purchaser
promptly after the Execution Date a list of all individuals providing
contract labor services to Seller in connection with Sellers ownership and
operation of the Acquired Properties.

_Termination_

12.1 _Termination_.

 

(a) _Termination by Either Party_. Either Party may terminate this Agreement
by written notice to the other Party if Closing has not occurred on or before
October 31, 2012 (as such date may be tolled and extended during the pendency
of any dispute under _Section 6.8_ or by up to thirty (30) additional days to
the extent a filing is required under the HSR Act and the expiration or
requested termination of the notice periods under the HSR Act is still
pending); provided, however, that no Party hereto shall be entitled to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 12.1(a)_ if the Closing has
failed to occur as a result of the negligent, willful intentional failure or
intentional breach or inaccuracy of such Partys representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements hereunder.

 

(b) _Mutual Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated by the mutual
agreement of Purchaser and Seller pursuant to a written document or

12.2 _Remedies_.

 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by Seller under _Section 12.1(a)_ because
Closing has not occurred solely or primarily as a result of the failure or
breach by Purchaser of any representations, warranties or covenants of
Purchaser set forth in this Agreement that has prevented the satisfaction of
the conditions of Seller set forth in  _Section 11.2_, then the Deposit
shall be released to Seller from the Deposit Escrow Account in accordance with
the Deposit Escrow Agreement, which Deposit shall constitute liquidated
damages for any and all breaches of this Agreement by Purchaser and such
remedy shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Seller for any such
failure of Purchaser. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT (i) SELLERS
ACTUAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM SUCH TERMINATION WOULD BE DIFFICULT, IF NOT
IMPOSSIBLE TO CALCULATE AND (b) THE DEPOSIT IS A FAIR AND FAIR AND REASONABLE
ESTIMATE OF SELLERS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES IN
CALCULATING THE ACTUAL DAMAGES THAT WILL BE SUFFERED BY SELLER UNDER
THE CIRCUMSTANCES SET FORTH IN _SECTION 12.1(a)_ AND (c) SUCH LIQUIDATED
DAMAGES ARE NOT A PENALTY.

(b) Except as provided in _Section 12.2(a)_, if this Agreement is
terminated, then the Deposit shall be released to Purchaser from the Deposit
Escrow Account in accordance with the Deposit Escrow Agreement.

 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser under (i) _Section 12.1(a)_
because Closing has not occurred solely or primarily as a result of the
failure or breach by

 



44  Seller of any representations, warranties or covenants of Seller set forth
in this Agreement that has prevented the satisfaction of the conditions of
Purchaser set forth in  _Section 11.3_, or (ii) _Section 12.1(c)_ then,
subject to _Section 17.2_ and the other provisions of this Agreement, (x) the
Deposit shall be immediately released to Purchaser from the Deposit Escrow
and (y) Seller shall remain liable to Purchaser for all Losses incurred by
Purchaser arising out of or relating to such breach or default; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the aggregate Liability of Seller under this _Section
12.2_ or otherwise under this Agreement or in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions from and after the termination of this Agreement
shall not exceed an amount equal to 10% of the Base Purchase Price and
Purchaser hereby waives, relinquishes and releases Seller from any liability
or Losses in excess of such amount or any other rights or remedies available
to Purchaser at law or equity.

(d) Each of the Parties acknowledges that damages at Law or as provided in
this Agreement will be an adequate remedy in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by the other Party of any covenant, obligation, or other
provision set forth in this Agreement, and no Party shall be entitled to, and
each Party hereby waives and relinquishes any right or remedies available
under Law or at equity to: (i) any decree or order of specific performance or
mandamus to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant,
obligation, or other provision; or (ii) an injunction restraining such breach
or threatened breach.

 

(e) Promptly, but in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the
termination date of this Agreement, the Parties hereto shall execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent written instructions instructing the Escrow Agent
to disburse via wire transfer of immediately available funds the entirety of
the Deposit to the applicable Party entitled to receive the Deposit as
provided in this _Section 12.2_.

12.3 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated under _Section
12.1,_ all rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall
terminate without any further Liability or obligation of any Party to any
other Party; provided, however, that the provisions in  _Sections 10.13_ and
_10.14_ (relating to confidentiality and press releases), the indemnification
obligations of Purchaser under _Section 4.3(b)_, the provisions of _Section
12.2_ and this _Section 12.3_ (relating to termination), the provisions in
_Article 1_ and _Article 17_ , the other provisions of this Agreement that
expressly survive the termination of this Agreement, and the definitions in
_Appendix A_ (to the extent used in the foregoing Sections, Articles, and
provisions) shall survive the termination of this Agreement and remain in full
force and effect. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of the Parties
under the Deposit Escrow Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.

Records and other information and records as Seller reasonably deem necessary
or appropriate, shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a final settlement

by the Houston, Texas office of Deloitte LLP, or if such firm declines to act
in such capacity, by another firm of independent accountants that does not
have a material relationship with any Party and that is reasonably acceptable
to Seller and Purchaser (the " _Accounting Referee_ "). To the extent
necessary, Seller and Purchaser shall act in good faith to promptly agree on
the Accounting Referee and to execute such engagement letters and other
documents as shall be necessary to engage the Accounting Referee within 10
Business Days after the expiration of the Negotiation Period. After the

binding, and conclusive; (ii) shall adjust Sellers proposed calculation of
the Final Purchase Price, if at all, to reflect the resolution of any such
Final Settlement Dispute; (iii) may not determine a Final Purchase Price that
is more than the applicable amount in the Final Settlement Statement or

(iv) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete its work and
deliver to Purchaser and Seller a written report of its decision as promptly
as practicable, and in any event within 30 Business Days after it has been
engaged as the Accounting Referee.

deliver to the Accounting Referee (with a copy to the other Party) a written
presentation as to its position within 10 Business Days after the engagement
of the Accounting Referee. Within 10 Business Days thereafter at a time and
place agreed by the Parties and the Accounting Referee (or if the Parties are
unable to agree, as determined by the Accounting Referee), each Party, shall
have the right to make an oral presentation of its position and to present
one or

 



48  more (but not more than two) witnesses at a hearing conducted by the
Accounting Referee. The remaining procedures governing such a hearing shall be
determined by the Accounting Referee, except that each of Seller and
Purchaser shall have the right to an approximately equal amount of time to
present its position.

commercially reasonable efforts to complete its work and deliver to Seller and
Purchaser a written report of its decision as to any Final Settlement
Disputes as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 30 Business Days

any required certifications from the Title Expert under  _Section 5.10_).
The Accounting Referees report shall include a calculation of the Final
Purchase Price and any item or component thereof that was not finally
determined during or before the Negotiation Period and a line-item comparison
(showing increases and decreases) to the calculations contained in the Final
Settlement Statement and the Objection Report, together with explanations of
each variance. If any Final Settlement Dispute is submitted to the
Accounting Referee under this _Section 14.1_, then the Final Purchase Price,
as determined by the Accounting Referee and set forth in its report, shall be
final, binding, and conclusive on all Parties.

 

(h) _Final Determination Date_. The date (the " _Final Determination Date_ ")
on which the Final Purchase Price shall be deemed to have been determined
shall be the earliest of: (i) the Objection Date, if Purchaser has not
delivered an Objection Report with respect to the Final Purchase Price by the
Objection Date; (ii) the date during the Negotiation Period that Purchaser
and Seller have resolved all disputed amounts with respect to the Final
Purchase Price, if all disputed amounts with respect to the Final Purchase
Price are resolved during the Negotiation Period; and (iii) the date on which
the Accounting Referee delivers its report as to the final determination as to
the Final Purchase Price, if submitted to the Accounting Referee.

 

(i) _Cooperation_. Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their
respective Entity Representatives and independent accountants to, cooperate
and assist as requested by the Parties and the Accounting Referee in the
preparation of the Final Settlement Statement and the calculation of the Final
Purchase Price and in providing access and conducting reviews referred to in
this _Section 14.1_, including making available to the extent necessary their
respective books, records, work papers, and personnel.

 

(j) _Payment of Final Purchase Price_. If (i) the Final Purchase Price as
finally determined under this  _Section 14.1_ is more than (ii) the Closing
Amount, then Purchaser shall pay to Seller, within two Business Days after the
Final Determination Date, the amount of such difference by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by Seller.
If the amount in _clause (i)_ above is _less than_ the Closing Amount, then
Seller shall pay to Purchaser, within two Business Days after the Final
Determination Date, the amount of such difference by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by Purchaser.

14.2  _Amounts Received After the Closing_. After the Closing, any cash
received by Seller applicable to any post-Effective Time production of
Hydrocarbons from, or any other proceeds received by or credited to Seller and
attributable to, the Acquired Properties shall be paid by Seller to Purchaser
within 30 days after receipt of such payment, and any payment received by
Purchaser applicable to any pre-Effective Time production of Hydrocarbons from
the Acquired Properties shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller within 30 days
after receipt of such payment. Payments under this _Section 14.2_ shall be
grossed

 



49  up to take into account any netting or set-offs by the purchaser of any such
production against obligations of the recipient of such cash that are not
related to the purchase of such production. Payments under this _Section
14.2_ shall not constitute an adjustment to any portion of the Purchase Price.
Adjustments to the Purchase Price after the Closing shall be made only under
_Section 14.1_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the obligations of each Party under this _Section 14.2_ shall (a) apply only
to payments related to the Acquired Assets and received on or before twelve
(12) months after the Closing Date. 

14.3 _Records_. Seller shall make the Acquired Records available for pick up
by Purchaser at a mutually agreeable time promptly after the Closing at the
locations and in the format currently maintained by Seller. Seller may retain,
at its sole cost and expense, copies of the Records. The Acquired Records
shall be made available to Seller after the Closing for review and copying as
reasonably requested by Seller. Purchaser shall not destroy or otherwise
dispose of any Acquired Records related to or would be reasonably be likely to
relate to the determination of or payment of any Taxes for which Seller
is responsible for hereunder for a period of seven years after the Closing
without providing Seller reasonable written notice and an opportunity to copy
any such Acquired Records.

 

14.4 _Rental Administration_. Seller, as an accommodation to Purchaser and
subject to the last sentence of this  _Section 14.4_, shall attempt to pay
all lease rentals and shut-in payments due and payable through the Rental
Administration Period, with respect to those Acquired Assets operated by
Seller. The Final Settlement Statement and the Final Purchase Price shall
include an upward adjustment for lease rentals and shut-in payments paid by
Seller through the Rental Administration Period, to the extent such payments
by Seller are not reflected in the Preliminary Settlement Statement, and such
payments cover periods after the Effective Time, and any further adjustments
required by reason of Sellers disbursement of production revenue under this
_Section 14.4_. AT THE CLOSING, PURCHASER SHALL BE DEEMED TO ASSUME
ALL RISK, LIABILITY, AND LOSSES, AND HEREBY WAIVES ANY CLAIMS AGAINST THE
INDEMNIFIED SELLER PARTIES THAT PURCHASER MAY HAVE, OR THAT MAY ARISE IN THE
FUTURE, WHETHER KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, FIXED OR CONTINGENT, ARISING OUT OF OR IN
CONNECTION WITH DISBURSEMENTS AND LEASE RENTAL AND SHUT-IN PAYMENTS MADE BY
SELLER UNDER THIS _SECTION 14.4_ , UNLESS CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR
WILLFUL FAULT OF SELLER.

14.5 _Suspense Accounts_. At the Closing, Seller shall transfer to Purchaser,
and Purchaser shall assume, any suspense accounts maintained by Seller holding
monies payable to royalty owners, mineral owners, and other Persons with an
interest in pre-Effective Time production of Hydrocarbons from the Acquired
Properties that Seller has been unable to pay because such Persons cannot be
located, the identity of such Persons is unknown, or any other reason. At the
Closing, Purchaser shall be deemed to assume full and complete Liability and

delivered, to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall execute, acknowledge, and
deliver, and cause to be executed, acknowledged, and delivered to Seller, such

(a) _Straddle Period_. All Property and Production Taxes attributable to the
ownership or operation of the Acquired Assets for the 2012 calendar year (the
" _Straddle Period_ ") shall be reflected as a Base Purchase Price adjustment
under _Section 3.2_, and apportioned between Purchaser and Seller as of the
Effective Time, in the case of Property Taxes, based on the number of days in
the Straddle Period that occurred before the Effective Time (in the case of
Seller) and on or after the Effective Time (in the case of Purchaser), and in

(i) actual production, expressed in volume or units, attributable to the days

(a) To the extent required in the Transition Services Agreement, Seller shall

Taxes, fees, transfer fees, and charges incurred or required to be paid by any

take any position on its Tax returns that is inconsistent with the allocation
of the Purchase Price (plus other capitalized costs) as so agreed or as
adjusted.

 

15.6 _Section 1031 Exchange Accommodation_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, but subject to this
_Section 15.6_, either Party (in such capacity, the " _Exchanging Party_ ")
may at any time prior to Closing assign all or any portion of its rights under
this Agreement and take such other steps as required to satisfy the
requirements of one or more like-kind exchanges pursuant to Code section 1031
with respect to such Exchanging Party (an " _Exchange Transaction_ "). Subject
to the other provisions of this _Section 15.6_, the other Party (in such
capacity, the " _Non-Exchanging Party_ ") shall, as and when reasonably
requested by the Exchanging Party from time to time, execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments, and
take, or cause to be taken, all such further actions as the Exchanging Party
may determine is reasonably necessary or appropriate for purposes of causing
the Contemplated Transactions, in whole or in part, to satisfy the
requirements of Code section 1031 with respect to the Exchanging Party.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless the Exchanging Party provides
for reimbursement or indemnity reasonably acceptable to the Non-Exchanging
Party: (i) the Non-Exchanging Party shall not be obligated to pay any
additional costs or incur any additional obligations or Liabilities in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions if such costs, obligations or
Liabilities arise out of or result from the Exchange Transaction (ii) the Non-
Exchanging Party shall not be obligated to take title to any other assets or
property, or to undertake any obligations to any third party, as a result of
the Exchange Transaction; and (iii) nothing herein shall be deemed the
agreement of the Non-Exchanging Party to delay the

 



53  Closing of, or payment under, this Agreement, in connection with the
Exchange Transaction. The Non-Exchanging Party shall provide no assurance to
the Exchanging Party that any particular tax treatment will be given to the
Exchanging Party as a result of the Exchange Transaction, and the Non-
Exchanging Party shall have no obligation to the Exchanging Party or any other
Person if the Exchange Transaction fails to qualify as a "like kind exchange"
under Code section 1031 or similar state or local tax provision.

(c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that whole or partial assignments by
the Exchanging Party of rights under this Agreement or any of the Acquired
Assets to one or more qualified intermediaries or exchange accommodation
titleholders as required by Code section 1031 and the administrative rules
governing same (an " _Intermediary_ ") shall not (i) release the Exchanging
Party from any of its Liabilities and obligations under this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document, or (ii) expand any Liabilities or obligations of
the Non-Exchanging Party under this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document. The Exchanging Party, and its successors and assigns, shall be
jointly and severally liable for the obligations and Liabilities of the
Exchanging Party under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, and
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Non-Exchanging Party from and
against all Claims, Losses and Liabilities, if any, arising out of
or resulting from an Exchange Transaction (but only to the extent such
Claims, Losses and Liabilities would not have arisen if the Contemplated
Transactions had been consummated without the Exchange Transaction) without
regard to the Indemnification Threshold, including any Claims, Losses and
Liabilities arising out of or resulting from the transfer, assignment or
conveyance of any Acquired Assets to an Intermediary instead of the Exchanging
Party.

 

(d) In order to minimize administrative burdens as well as third party
preferential purchase and consent rights, Seller and Purchaser may transfer
the Acquired Assets to a newly-formed, Delaware limited liability company
wholly owned by Seller (a "Title LLC"), and then may substitute the assignment
of such Acquired Assets by the assignment of all of the membership interests
in such Title LLC directly or through an Intermediary. Subject to this
_Section 15.6_ particularly _Sections 15.6(b) and (c)_ , the Seller and
Purchaser agree to work in good faith to accommodate utilization of a Title
LLC in an Exchange Transaction if desired by either party.

Seller Party or an Indemnified Purchaser Party (an " _Indemnified Party_ ")
is or may be entitled to indemnification or a defense under _Section 16.2_,
and such Party desires to assert its right to indemnification or a defense,
such Party must deliver a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Party
that the Indemnified Party believes is obligated to provide such
indemnification or defense to the Indemnified Party (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ "). To be effective, a Claim Notice must include: (i) either (A) if
known, the amount of the Loss or Claim, (B) if not known but subject to

to the Indemnifying Party: (i) within 30 Business Days after the Indemnified
Party receives notice or obtains knowledge of the Claim or Proceeding; and

_Section 16.2(b)_, as applicable, in connection with the breach by an
Indemnifying Party of a representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement _;
provided, however_ , that a delay in giving a notice of a Third-Party Claim

relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations hereunder
with respect to such Third-Party Claim.

Third-Party Claim for which indemnification may be sought under _Section

_(ii)_ of _Section 16.2(b)_, as applicable, in connection with the breach by
an Indemnifying Party of a representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement;

required under _clause (i)_ of this _Section 16.3(c)_ (but not _clause (ii)_
of this _Section 16.3(c)_) shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations under _Section 16.2_, except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party was actually and materially prejudiced by such delay. 

16.4 _Third-Party Claims_. With respect to a Third-Party Claim:

 

(a) _Defense by Indemnifying Party_. If an Indemnified Party asserts it is
entitled to indemnification or a defense in connection with a Third-Party
Claim, at the election of the

 



57  Indemnifying Party made by written notice to the Indemnified Party within 30
Business Days after receipt of a Claim Notice with respect to such Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume
control of the defense of such Third-Party Claim, including the determination
of all appropriate actions, the negotiation of settlements on behalf of the
Indemnified Party, and the conduct of any related Proceedings through
attorneys of the Indemnifying Partys choice; provided, however, the
Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) Business
Day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem
necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying
Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. If an
Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of such defense:

 

(i) the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have admitted its obligation to
indemnify and defend the Indemnified Party in respect of such Third-Party
Claim and may not later contest such obligation; provided, however, such
admission shall in no event be deemed to waive any limitations as to the
liability of, or expand any obligations of such Indemnifying Party hereunder;

(ii) the Indemnifying Party shall conduct such defense in a diligent manner at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party;

(iii) the Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying
Party all non-privileged documents and materials in the possession or control
of the Indemnified Party relating to the Third-Party Claim and provide such
other information and assistance that the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably
deem necessary to the proper defense of the Third-Party Claim;

(iv) the Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party all
privileged documents and materials in the possession or control of the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third-Party Claim pursuant to the terms of a
joint defense or common interest agreement mutually agreed in good faith by
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, unless counsel for the
Indemnified Party reasonably determines that providing such information and
entering into such joint defense or common interest agreement would compromise
conflicting Claims of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party;

(v) the Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party informed of all
material developments and events relating to the defense of the Third-Party
Claim, and provide copies of any materials disclosed to the claimant or
plaintiff in connection with the defense of the Third-Party Claim; and

 

(vi) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle, adjust, or
compromise such Third-Party Claim: (A) with the written consent of the
Indemnified Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned; or (B) without the consent of the Indemnified Party, if such
settlement, adjustment, or compromise includes an unconditional release of
the Indemnified Party and the other Indemnified Seller Parties or Indemnified
Purchaser Parties, as applicable, and imposes no relief other than monetary
damages and does not otherwise materially and adversely affect the Indemnified
Party or the Acquired Assets.

 



58 (b) _Defense By Indemnified Party_. If an Indemnified Party asserts it is
entitled to a defense of the Third-Party Claim under _Section 16.2_, and the
Indemnifying Party does not timely elect to assume control of the defense, or
elects to assume control of the defense but does not continue to conduct
such defense in a diligent manner, then:

(i) if it is finally determined in a non-appealable final judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction that the Indemnifying Party was obligated to provide
such defense, all costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party to
defend the Third-Party Claim shall be for the account of the Indemnifying
Party; 

(ii) whether or not the Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide such
defense, the Indemnifying Party shall make available to the Indemnified Party
all non-privileged documents and materials in the possession or control of the
Indemnifying Party relating to the Third-Party Claim and provide such other
information and assistance that the Indemnified Party shall reasonably deem
necessary to the proper defense of the Third-Party Claim;

(iii) the Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party informed of all
material developments and events relating to the defense of the Third-Party
Claim, and provide copies of any materials disclosed to the claimant or
plaintiff in connection with the defense of the Third-Party Claim; and

(iv) the Indemnified Party shall have the right to settle, adjust, or
compromise such Third-Party Claim with the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

(c) _Cooperation_. If a Third-Party Claim requires immediate action, both the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in good faith to
take appropriate action so as not to jeopardize the defense of such Third-
Party Claim or any Partys position with respect to such Third-Party Claim.

(d) _No Impairment_. The assumption of control of the defense of a Third-Party
Claim, the payment of amounts in settlement of a Third-Party Claim, and the
payment of judgments with respect to a Third-Party Claim by an Indemnifying
Party shall not limit or impair the right of such Indemnifying Party to
dispute in an appropriate Proceeding its obligation to indemnify or provide a
defense to the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third-Party Claim. If
it is finally determined in such Proceeding that the Indemnifying Party does
not have an indemnification obligation with respect to such Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to recover from the Indemnified
Party any amounts paid in settlement or amounts paid with respect to a
judgment, but shall not be entitled to recover any costs and expenses of any
defense provided by the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the amount of such costs and expenses shall apply against the limitations set
forth in _Section 16.5(b)_.

16.5  _Limitations on Losses_. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this
Agreement:

(a) the aggregate Liability of Seller under (i) _Section 16.2(a)(i)_ for
the sum of indemnification payments and the costs and expenses of defense
shall be limited to 15% of the Base Purchase Price and (ii) the terms of this
Agreement, including _Section 16.2(a)(i)_, shall be limited to 20% of the
Base Purchase Price;

(b) Seller shall have no Liability under _Sections 16.2(a)(i)_ or _(ii)_ for
indemnification until such time as the aggregate amount of all Losses suffered
or incurred by

 



59  the Indemnified Purchaser Parties subject to indemnification under _Sections
16.2(a)(i)_ or _(ii)_ exceeds the Indemnification Threshold, and if the
aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds the Indemnification Threshold,
then Seller shall only be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Purchaser
Parties for such excess;

(c) the Liability and obligations of Seller under _Section 16.2(a)(iv)_ shall
be limited in all respects as provided in _Section 5.7(b)_;

 

(d) the Parties shall treat, for Tax purposes, any amounts paid under this
_Article 16_ as an adjustment to the Purchase Price;

(e) the amount of any Claims and Losses for which Purchaser or any Indemnified
Purchaser Party is entitled to indemnity under this _Article 16_ shall be
reduced by the amount of Tax benefit realized or the amount of insurance or
other third party proceeds, reimbursements or claims realized or that could
reasonably be expected to be realized by Purchaser or the Indemnified
Purchaser Party if a claim were properly pursued under the relevant insurance
arrangements with respect to such Losses and Claims and Purchaser shall use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to pursue and prosecute any and all claims
against Third Parties for which Purchaser or any Indemnified Purchaser Party
is entitled to indemnity from Seller hereunder; provided, however, to the
extent Purchaser or any Indemnified Purchaser Party is entitled to indemnity
under this _Article 16_ , subject to the terms of this Article 16 such
Purchaser and the other Indemnified Purchaser Parties shall, subject to the
terms of this _Article 16_ , be entitled to indemnity for any unreimbursed
Losses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Purchaser or any
Indemnified Purchaser Party in connection with the pursuit or prosecution of
any such claims against Third Parties.

 

(f) each Indemnified Party shall make reasonable efforts to mitigate or
minimize all Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition
which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses and Claims that
are indemnifiable hereunder and if an Indemnified Party fails to so mitigate
any indemnifiable Losses and Claims under the preceding sentence, the Party
that would otherwise have an indemnity obligation hereunder with respect to
such Losses and Claims shall have no liability for any portion of such Damages
that reasonably could have been avoided or mitigated had the Indemnified Party
made such efforts;

(g) No Affiliate of Seller or any Indemnified Seller Parties and their
respective directors, managers, partners, members, stockholders, officers,
employees, attorneys, contractors and agents shall have any liability to any
Indemnified Purchaser Party hereunder or under any other agreement delivered
by or on behalf of any Indemnified Seller Party in connection with the
Contemplated Transaction. Except with respect to the Liability of Guarantor
pursuant to the guaranty provided herein, no Affiliate of Purchaser or any
Indemnified Purchaser Parties and their respective directors, managers,
partners, members, stockholders, officers, employees, attorneys, contractors
and agents shall have any liability to any Indemnified Seller Party hereunder
or under any other agreement delivered by or on behalf of any Indemnified
Purchaser Party in connection with the execution of this Agreement or the
execution of the other Transaction Documents;

 

(h) EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE
INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE WITHOUT REGARD TO:
(i) THE INDEMNIFIED PARTYS SOLE, JOINT, CONCURRENT, CONTRIBUTORY, OR
COMPARATIVE

 



60  NEGLIGENCE, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER FAULT; OR (ii)
WHETHER THE LIABILITY IS BASED ON PAST, PRESENT, OR FUTURE ACTS, CLAIMS, OR
LAWS (INCLUDING ANY PAST, PRESENT, OR FUTURE BULK SALES LAW, ENVIRONMENTAL
LAW, FRAUDULENT TRANSFER LAW, SECURITIES LAW, OR OTHER LAW); AND

 

(i) NO PARTY OR INDEMNIFYING PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR
INDEMNIFICATION, CLAIMS, LOSSES, OR OTHERWISE UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS
AGREEMENT FOR, AND "LOSSES" AND "CLAIMS" SHALL NOT INCLUDE, (i) ANY COST,
EXPENSE, DAMAGE, LOSS, OR LIABILITY IN THE NATURE OF INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,
SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, LOST BUSINESS
OPPORTUNITIES, OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE (EVEN IF THE INDEMNIFYING OR BREACHING
PARTY IS AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING), EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
THAT ANY OF THE FOREGOING RELATE TO THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS SUFFERED BY ANY THIRD
PARTY FOR WHICH RESPONSIBILITY IS ALLOCATED BETWEEN THE PARTIES, WHICH SHALL
BE INCLUDED IN LOSSES AND CLAIMS OR (ii) ANY DIMINUTION OF VALUE OR INCREASE
IN LIABILITY, LOSS, CLAIMS, COST, EXPENSE, AWARD OR JUDGMENT TO THE EXTENT
SUCH INCREASE IS CAUSED BY THE ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS OF ANY PERSON ENTITLED TO
INDEMNIFICATION HEREUNDER AFTER THE CLOSING DATE

16.6  _Exclusive Remedy_.

(a) _Exclusive Remedy._ If the Closing occurs, the right of Purchaser
to indemnification under _Section 16.2_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Purchaser against any Indemnified Seller Party for, subject to the
limitations set forth in _Sections 16.1_ , _16.3_ , and _16.5_ : (i)
any breach by Seller of any of its respective representations, warranties,
covenants, and agreements in the Transaction Documents; (ii) all Claims and
Losses of Purchaser arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the
Transaction Documents or the Contemplated Transactions; and (iii) all other
Claims and Losses arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the
Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, IN EACH CASE, EVEN IF CAUSED IN
WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER GROSS, SOLE, JOINT, ACTIVE,
PASSIVE, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF
ANY PERSON.

(b) _Waiver_. If the Closing occurs, except for the right of Purchaser to
indemnification under _Section 16.2_, Purchaser shall be deemed to have
waived, to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any right to contribution
against any Indemnified Seller Party (including any contribution under CERCLA
or any other Environmental Law) and any and all other Claims and rights it may
have against or from any Indemnified Seller Party arising under or based on
any Law or other legal theory (whether in contract, tort, equity, or
otherwise).

16.7 _Waiver of Right to Rescission_. Seller and Purchaser acknowledge that
the payment of money, as limited by the terms of this Agreement, shall be
adequate compensation for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein or for any other claim arising in connection with
or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party
hereby waives and relinquishes any right to rescind this Agreement, the
purchase and sale of the Acquired Assets, and the assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities, or any of the other Contemplated Transactions.

 



61 16.8 _Releases_. Except for the remedies expressly for which Seller has
agreed to indemnify the Indemnified Purchaser Parties under this Agreement or
Sellers special warranty of title set forth in the Assignment, at the Closing
Purchaser, on its own behalf and on behalf of the other Indemnified Purchaser
Parties, shall be deemed to have waived and released the Indemnified Seller
Parties from, and Purchaser shall assume, any and all Claims and Losses the
Purchaser or the Indemnified Purchaser Parties might now or subsequently may
have, based on, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or Sellers
ownership, use or operation of the Acquired Assets, or the condition, quality,
status or nature of the Acquired Assets, including rights to contribution
under any Environmental Laws, breaches of statutory and implied warranties,
nuisance or other tort actions, rights to punitive damages, common law rights
of contribution, any rights under insurance policies issued or underwritten by
the other Party or any Affiliate of such Party and any rights under
agreements between Seller and any Indemnified Seller Party, EVEN IF CAUSED IN
WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER GROSS, SOLE, JOINT, ACTIVE,
PASSIVE, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF
ANY RELEASED PERSON, INVITEES OR THIRD PARTIES, but excluding, however, any
remaining balance owed by Seller to any other Affiliate of Seller at the end
of the Closing Date for provision of goods or services, or employment related
costs, or other ordinary course of business expenses, with respect to the
ownership or operation of the Assets.

16.9  _Subrogation_. To the extent of the indemnification obligations in this
Agreement, Purchaser and Seller hereby waive for themselves and their
respective successors and assigns, including any insurers, any rights to
subrogation for Losses for which such Party is liable or against which such
Party indemnifies any other Person under this Agreement. If required by
applicable insurance policies, each Party shall obtain a waiver of such
subrogation from its insurers.

 

16.10 _Reservation as to Non-Parties_. Except to the extent expressly
transferred to Purchaser hereunder, nothing in this Agreement is intended to
limit or otherwise waive any recourse Seller may have against any Person that
is not an Indemnified Seller Party or a Purchase Indemnified Party for any
obligations or Liabilities that may be incurred with respect to the Acquired
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities.

16.11 _Express Negligence/Conspicuous Manner_. WITH RESPECT TO
THIS AGREEMENT, BOTH PARTIES AGREE THAT THE PROVISIONS SET OUT IN THIS
_ARTICLE 16_ COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENT, KNOWN AS THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE
RULE, TO EXPRESSLY STATE IN A CONSPICUOUS MANNER TO AFFORD FAIR AND ADEQUATE
NOTICE THAT THIS AGREEMENT HAS PROVISIONS REQUIRING THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY TO
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER GROSS, SOLE, JOINT, ACTIVE,
PASSIVE, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER FAULT OF THE
INDEMNIFIED PARTY. EACH OF SELLER AND PURCHASER UNDERSTAND THAT PURSUANT TO
THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY IS SOMETIMES AN INDEMNIFYING PARTY AND SOMETIMES AN
INDEMNIFIED PARTY. EACH INDEMNIFYING PARTY REPRESENTS TO THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY
(1) THAT IT, THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY HAS CONSULTED AN ATTORNEY CONCERNING THIS
AGREEMENT OR, IF IT HAS NOT CONSULTED AN ATTORNEY, THAT IT WAS PROVIDED THE
OPPORTUNITY AND HAD THE ABILITY TO SO CONSULT, BUT MADE AN INFORMED DECISION
NOT TO DO SO, AND (2) THAT IT, THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY FULLY UNDERSTANDS ITS
OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

of such courts (and the appellate courts thereof) and agrees not to commence

way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise), and hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives in any such Proceeding commenced in such court, any
objection or claim that such Party is not subject personally to the
jurisdiction of such court or that such Proceeding has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. If such courts refuse to exercise jurisdiction hereunder,

Liabilities, and obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that (i)
the assigning Party shall provide to the non-assigning Party prompt written

more counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be an

or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement
to enter into this Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the internal laws of the state of Texas applicable to agreements made and
to be performed entirely within such State, without regard to any choice-of-

contained in this Agreement shall be severable. If any provision of this
Agreement (or any portion thereof) or the application of any such provision
(or any portion thereof) to any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid,
illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or
unenforceability shall not affect the validity, legality, or enforceability

circumstance or in any other jurisdiction. The invalidity or unenforceability
of any provision of this Agreement in any jurisdiction or

convenience of reference only and are not intended to govern, limit or aid in
the construction of any term or provision hereof. The rights and obligations
of each Party shall be determined pursuant to this Agreement. Each of Seller
and Purchaser has had the opportunity to exercise business discretion in
relation to the negotiation of the details and terms of the transaction
contemplated hereby. This Agreement is the result of arms
length negotiations from equal bargaining positions. It is the intention of
the Parties that every covenant, term and provision of this Agreement shall be
construed simply according to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against
any Party (notwithstanding any rule of law requiring an agreement to be
strictly construed against the drafting Party) and no consideration shall be
given or presumption made, on the basis of who drafted this Agreement or any
particular provision thereof, it being understood that the Parties to this
Agreement are sophisticated and have had adequate opportunity and means to

Schedule  Page 14 SELLERS DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES

 

Neither these Schedules nor any disclosure made in or by virtue of them
constitutes or implies any representation, warranty, or covenant by Seller
not expressly set out in the Agreement, and neither these Schedules nor any
such disclosure has the effect of, or may be construed as, adding to,
broadening, deleting from or revising the scope of any of the representations,
warranties, or covenants of Seller in the Agreement. Any item or matter
disclosed or listed on any particular Schedule is deemed to be disclosed or
listed on any other Schedules to the extent it is reasonably apparent that
such item relates or is applicable to, or is properly disclosed under, such
other Schedule or the section of the Agreement to which such other Schedule
corresponds, notwithstanding the fact that the Schedules are arranged to
correspond to the sections of the Agreement, that a particular section of
the Agreement makes reference to a particular Schedule, or that a particular
representation, warranty or covenant in the Agreement may not make reference
to a Schedule. Matters reflected in these Schedules are not necessarily
limited to matters required by the Agreement to be reflected in these
Schedules. The fact that any item of information is contained herein is not an
admission of liability under any applicable law, and does not mean that such
information is required to be disclosed in or by the Agreement, or that such
information is material, but rather is intended only to qualify the
representations, warranties and covenants in the Agreement and to set forth
other information required by the Agreement. Neither the specification of
any dollar amount in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in
the Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in these Schedules is
intended to imply that such amount, or a higher or lower amount, or the item
so included, or any other item, is or is not material, and no party shall use
the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any
dispute or controversy between or among the parties to the Agreement as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in
these Schedules is or is not material for purposes of the Agreement. The
information set forth on the Schedules shall not be used as a basis for
interpreting the terms "material," "materially," "materiality", "Material
Adverse Effect", or any similar qualification in the Agreement. Neither the
specification of any item or matter in any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in the Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
these Schedules is intended to imply that such item or matter, or another item
or matter, is or is not in the ordinary course of business, and no party shall
use the setting forth or the inclusion of any such item or matter in any
dispute or controversy between or among the parties to the Agreement as to
whether any obligation, item or matter described or not described herein or
included or not included in these Schedules is or is not in the ordinary
course of business for purposes of the Agreement.

Headings have been inserted in these Schedules for reference only and do not
amend the descriptions of the disclosed items set forth in the Agreement.
Where a reference is made to a section or exhibit, such reference shall be to
a section of or exhibit to the Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever
the words "include," "includes," or "including" are used in these Schedules,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation," whether
or not they are in fact followed by those words or words of like import.
