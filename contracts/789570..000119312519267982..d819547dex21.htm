money of the United States of America and legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, in the manner provided in <B>Section</B><B></B><B>&nbsp;3.3</B>. The Base Rent during any Lease Year is payable in advance in consecutive equal
monthly installments on the first (1<U><SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">st</SUP></U>) Business Day of each calendar month during that Lease Year. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, Rent and Additional Charges shall be prorated as
to any partial months at the beginning and end of the Term. Rent payable during any Lease Year consisting of more or less than twelve (12)&nbsp;calendar months shall be adjusted such that the portion of the Rent for each calendar month in any such

hereby acknowledges that late payment by Tenant to Landlord of Rent or Additional Charges will cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated hereunder, the exact amount of which is presently anticipated to be extremely difficult to ascertain.
Accordingly, if any installment of Rent or Additional Charges (other than Additional Charges payable to a Person other than Landlord) shall not be paid within five (5)&nbsp;days after its due date, Tenant will pay Landlord on demand a late charge
equal to the lesser of (a)&nbsp;five percent (5%) of the amount of such installment or (b)&nbsp;the maximum amount permitted by law. The parties agree that this late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs that Landlord will
incur by reason of late payment by Tenant. The parties further agree that such late charge is Rent and not interest and such assessment does not constitute a lender or borrower/creditor relationship between Landlord and Tenant. Thereafter, if any
installment of Rent or Additional Charges shall not be paid within ten (10)&nbsp;days after its due date, the amount unpaid, including any late charges previously accrued, shall bear interest at the Overdue Rate from the due date of such installment
to the date of payment thereof, and Tenant shall pay such interest to Landlord on demand. The payment of such late charge or such interest shall not constitute waiver of, nor excuse or cure, any default under this Lease, nor prevent Landlord from
exercising any other rights and remedies available to Landlord. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>3.3</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><U>Method of Payment of
Rent</U></B>. Rent and Additional Charges to be paid to Landlord shall be paid by electronic funds transfer debit transactions through wire transfer of immediately available funds and shall be initiated by Tenant for settlement on or before the
Payment Date; provided, however, if the Payment Date is not a Business Day, then settlement shall be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day. Landlord shall provide Tenant with appropriate wire transfer information in a Notice from
Landlord to Tenant. If Landlord directs Tenant to pay any Rent to any party other than Landlord, Tenant shall send to Landlord, simultaneously with such payment, a copy of the transmittal letter or invoice and a check whereby such payment is made or
such other evidence of payment as Landlord may reasonably require. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>3.4</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><U>Net Lease</U></B>. Landlord
