-19-

 



    

(v)  Immediately following the Canadian Closing and the

with deliveries of Seller to Purchaser in clause (iv), Purchaser shall:

  

(A)  pay to Seller (or to an Affiliate designated by Seller) by

(C)  deliver to Seller the certificate required to be delivered
pursuant to 
  _Section 8.3(c)_.

  

2.4   _Estimated Adjusted Net Asset Statement_.

  

(a)  Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, Seller shall provide Purchaser with a
statement (the " _Estimated Adjusted Net Asset Statement_ ") setting forth
(x) Seller's good faith estimate of the Adjusted Net Asset Amount (the "

schedules supporting such calculation) and (y) the account or accounts to
which Purchaser shall transfer funds pursuant to _Section 2.3_.

  

(b)  The Estimated Adjusted Net Asset Statement shall be

reasonable detail. The Closing Adjusted Net Asset Statement shall be prepared
in accordance with the definition of Adjusted Net Asset Amount and in a manner
consistent with the Example Adjusted Net Asset Statement.

  

(b)  During the sixty (60)-day period immediately following
Seller's receipt of the Closing Adjusted Net Asset Statement (the " _Review
Period_ "), Seller and its representatives will be permitted to review
Purchaser's books, records and work papers relating to the Closing Adjusted
Net Asset Statement. Purchaser will, and will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its accountants to, cooperate with and assist Seller and its
representatives in the conduct of such

    

-20-

 



    

review, including by providing reasonable access to such books, records and
work papers and making available personnel to the extent reasonably required.

  

(c)  Purchaser agrees that, following the Closing through the
date that the Final Closing Adjusted Net Asset Statement becomes final and
binding, it will not take or permit to be taken any actions with respect to
any accounting books, records, policies or procedures on which the Financial
Statements or the Closing Adjusted Net Asset Statement are based, or on which
the Final Closing Adjusted Net Asset Statement is to be based, that would or
would reasonably be expected to impede or delay the determination of the
amount of the Adjusted Net Asset Amount or the preparation of any Objection
Notice or the Final Closing Adjusted Net Asset Statement in the manner and
utilizing the methods provided by this Agreement.

  

2.6   _Reconciliation of Post-Closing Statements_.

  

(a)  Seller shall notify Purchaser in writing prior to the
expiration of the Review Period if Seller disputes all or any portion of the
Closing Adjusted Net Asset Statement, which notice shall describe in
reasonable detail the basis for such dispute and the calculations of any
disputed amounts (the " _Objection Notice_ "). If no Objection Notice is
received by Purchaser prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then the
Closing Adjusted Net Asset Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by
Seller and shall become final and binding upon the Parties, absent fraud, in
accordance with _Section 2.6(c)_.

  

(b)  During the thirty (30) days immediately following the
delivery of an Objection Notice, or such longer period as the Parties may
agree in writing (the " _Resolution Period_ "), Seller and Purchaser shall
seek in good faith to resolve any differences that they may have with respect
to the matters specified in the Objection Notice.

  

(c)  If at the end of the Resolution Period Seller and Purchaser
have been unable to resolve any differences that they may have with respect
to the matters specified in the Objection Notice, Seller and Purchaser shall
submit all matters that remain in dispute with respect to the Objection
Notice (along with a copy of the Closing Adjusted Net Asset Statement marked
to indicate those line items that are not in dispute) to (i) an independent
certified public accounting firm in the United States of good national
reputation mutually acceptable to Seller and Purchaser or (ii) if Seller and
Purchaser are unable to agree upon such a firm within ten (10) Business Days,
Seller and Purchaser shall each select one such firm and those two firms
shall, within ten (10) Business Days after their selection, select a third
such firm (the firm selected in accordance with clause (i) or the third firm
selected in accordance with clause (ii), the " _Independent Accounting Firm_
"). Within thirty (30) days after the Independent Accounting Firm's
selection, the Independent Accounting Firm shall make a final determination,
binding on Seller and Purchaser, of the appropriate amount of each of the
line items in the Closing Adjusted Net Asset Statement which remain in dispute
as indicated in the Objection Notice which Seller and Purchaser have
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting
Firm shall calculate, based solely on the written submissions of Purchaser,
on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, and not by independent
investigation, the Adjusted Net Asset Amount and shall be instructed that its
calculation (i) must be made in accordance with the standards and definitions
in this Agreement, and (ii) with respect to each item in dispute, such
determination shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower,
of the amounts

    

-21-

 



    

advocated by Seller in the Objection Notice or by Purchaser in the Closing
Adjusted Net Asset Statement with respect to such disputed line item. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall act as an expert, and not as an arbitrator.
The statement of the Adjusted Net Asset Amount that is final and binding on
Seller and Purchaser, as determined either through agreement of Seller and
Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.6(a) or Section 2.6(b) or through the action
of the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 2.6(c), is
referred to as the " _Final Closing Adjusted Net Asset Statement_ " and the
Adjusted Net Asset Amount set forth therein as the " _Final Adjusted Net Asset
Amount_."

  

(d)  All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be
performed by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by Seller, on the
one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, in proportion to the absolute
values of the differences between the Adjusted Net Asset Amount as determined
by the Independent Accounting Firm and the Adjusted Net Asset Amount set forth
in the Objection Notice and the Closing Adjusted Net Asset Statement,
respectively. During the review by the Independent Accounting Firm,
Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
their respective accountants to, each make available to the
Independent Accounting Firm interviews with such personnel, and such
information, books and records and work papers, as may be reasonably
required by the Independent Accounting Firm to fulfill its obligations under
_Section 2.6(c)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that the accountants of Seller or
Purchaser shall not be obliged to make any work papers available to the
Independent Accounting Firm except in accordance with such accountants'
normal disclosure procedures and then only after such firm has signed a
customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants.

  

2.7   _Post-Closing Adjustment_. The " _Post-Closing Adjustment_
" shall be equal to (i) the Final Adjusted Net Asset Amount less (ii) the
Estimated Adjusted Net Asset Amount. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a
positive amount, then Purchaser shall pay in cash to Seller (or one or more
Affiliates designated by Seller) the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment. If
the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, then Seller (or an
Affiliate designated by Seller) shall pay in cash to Purchaser the amount of
the Post-Closing Adjustment. Any such payment shall be made within ten (10)
Business Days after the Final Closing Adjusted Net Asset Statement is
delivered, together with interest thereon at the Interest Rate from the
Closing Date until the date of payment. Any payment made pursuant to this
_Section 2.7_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

  

2.8   _Purchase Price Deposit_. Purchaser shall cause to be
deposited with J.P. Morgan Chase (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") in each case by
wire transfer of immediately available funds: (i) prior to or simultaneously
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, an amount equal to
$500,000,000; and (ii) no later than 5:00 p.m. New York local time on the date
(the " _Subsequent Deposit Date_ ") that is five (5) Business Days following
the date on which Seller provides irrevocable written notice to Purchaser
that it has or will promptly complete in all material respects steps 1 through
6 of the Restructuring Plan, an additional amount equal to $100,000,000 (the
" _Subsequent Deposit_ "), such that as of 5:00 p.m. New York local time on
the Subsequent Deposit Date the balance of the funds transferred by wire
transfer to the Escrow Agent shall be equal to $600,000,000, to be held by
the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ (the "
_Escrow Agreement_ "), and applied, together with all interest or any other
compensation earned

    

-22-

 



    

thereon from the date of deposit with the Escrow Agent until the earlier to
occur of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1_ , as set forth herein and as further set forth in the Escrow
Agreement. Seller and Purchaser shall cause the Escrow Agent to release the
Escrow Amount to Seller promptly upon the earlier to occur of (a) the
Closing, as part of Purchaser's payment of the Purchase Price
(without duplication), or (b) as set forth in _Section 9.4(a)_ , in each
case, as further set forth in the Escrow Agreement.

  

2.9   _Tax Treatment; Purchase Price Allocation_.

  

(a)  The parties agree that the purchase and sale of the Shares
shall be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as an acquisition by
Purchaser of all of the assets of the Transferred Company and that the
purchase and sale of Shares will be treated as an "applicable asset
acquisition" within the meaning of Section 1060 of the Code with respect to
Purchaser (the " _Transaction Tax Treatment_ ").

  

(b)  The parties agree that any amounts payable to Seller, as
increased by any liabilities of the Transferred Company and as adjusted to
reflect such other relevant items, as determined by the parties in good faith,
shall be allocated among the assets of the Transferred Company for U.S.
federal income tax purposes in the manner required by Section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and in accordance with
the following provisions of this _Section_ _2.9(b)_ and the methodology set
forth in Schedule 2.9. No later than sixty (60) Business Days after the
Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser an allocation of the Purchase
Price (and all other relevant amounts) among the assets of the Transferred
Company in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, which allocation shall be consistent with
the principles established in this Section 2.9(b) and the methodology set
forth in Section 2.9 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the " _Draft
Allocation_ "). In the event Purchaser disagrees with the Draft Allocation,
Purchaser may, within twenty (20) Business Days after delivery of the Draft
Allocation, deliver a notice to such effect (the " _Purchaser 's
Allocation Notice_") to Seller, specifying those items as to which Purchaser
reasonably disagrees and setting forth Purchaser's proposed allocation of the
Purchase Price (and all other relevant amounts). If Purchaser does not timely
deliver Purchaser's Allocation Notice, the Draft Allocation shall become
final. If Purchaser's Allocation Notice is duly delivered, Purchaser and
Seller shall, during the fifteen (15) Business Days following such delivery,
use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed
items or amounts in order to determine the allocation of the Purchase Price
(and all other relevant amounts). If Purchaser and Seller are unable to
resolve the dispute within the fifteen (15) Business Day period following the
delivery of Purchaser's Allocation Notice, then the matter will be submitted
to a neutral accounting firm (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") to resolve the
dispute in accordance with the standards set forth in this _Section_ _2.9(b)_.
All of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm retained pursuant to this 
  _Section_ _2.9(b)_ shall be allocated between Purchaser, on the one hand,
and Seller, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate
amount of the items unsuccessfully disputed or defended, as the case may be,
by such party (as finally determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the
total amount of the disputed items. The allocation as finally determined
pursuant to this _Section_ _2.9(b)_ (the " _Allocation_ ") shall be
appropriately adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect any payments made
hereunder that represent an adjustment to the purchase price for U.S. federal

    

-23-

 



    

income tax purposes, including any indemnity payments made pursuant to
_Article VII_ or _Article X_.

  

(c)  Except as required by Law or as would be inconsistent with
prevailing commercial or tax practice in a particular jurisdiction (not
including, for the avoidance of doubt, the United States or any of its
political subdivisions), the Parties shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to) report the relevant Tax consequences of the purchase and sale
contemplated under this Agreement in a manner consistent with the Transaction
Tax Treatment and the Allocation. Seller shall promptly provide Purchaser with
any other information required to complete IRS Form 8594. None of the parties
or any of their respective affiliates shall take any position inconsistent
with the Transaction Tax Treatment or the Allocation on any U.S. income Tax
Return or in any U.S. income Tax proceeding relating to such Taxes, in each
case, except to the extent required pursuant to a "determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any analogous provision of U.S.
state or local law).

  

Article III 
  
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

  

Except as set forth in (a) the disclosure schedule delivered to Purchaser
prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Seller Disclosure Schedule_
") ( _provided_ that disclosure in any section of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule shall apply to any other section to the extent that the relevance of
such disclosure to such other section is reasonably apparent) or (b) any
report filed by Seller or C2 Aviation Capital, Inc. with the SEC since
January 1, 2015, and except as contemplated by the Restructuring Plan, Seller
represents and warrants to Purchaser, as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing Date (except to the extent any such representation and warranty is
expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date)
as follows:

  

3.1   _Organization and Qualification_. Seller and each member of
the Commercial Air Group is a corporation, limited liability company or other
legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. Seller and each member of the
Commercial Air Group has all requisite corporate or other organizational power
and authority to carry on its businesses as now being conducted, and to lease
and operate its property and assets. Seller and each member of the
Commercial Air Group is qualified to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where the conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing or to have such power or authority would not give rise to material
liabilities, or would not reasonably be expected to materially impact the
operation of the Business.

  

3.2   _Capitalization of the Members of the Commercial Air
Group_.

  

(a)  The Shares and the authorized and outstanding equity
interests of each member of the Commercial Air Group have been
validly issued, are free and clear of all Liens, except for restrictions on
transfer under applicable Law, and were not issued in violation of any
preemptive rights. As of the Closing, except for the Shares or any interest
held by a member of the Commercial Air Group, there are no shares of common
stock, preferred stock or other equity interests of any member of the
Commercial Air Group reserved, issued or outstanding, and there

    

-24-

 



    

are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, subscriptions, options,
warrants, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights,
convertible, exercisable, or exchangeable securities or other agreements,
arrangements or commitments of any character relating to the issued or
unissued share capital or other ownership interest in any member of the
Commercial Air Group or any other securities or obligations convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to
subscribe for or acquire, any securities of any member of the Commercial Air
Group, and no securities evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or
outstanding. As of the Closing, no member of the Commercial Air Group has any
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations which provide the
holders thereof the right to (i) restrict the transfer of any shares of
capital stock of such member of the Commercial Air Group or (ii) vote (or are
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for securities having the
right to vote) with the stockholders of such member of the Commercial Air
Group on any matter.

  

(b)  Section 3.2(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets
forth, as of the date hereof, (i) for each member of the Commercial Air Group
that is not a trust, the authorized and outstanding capital stock (or other
equity interests) of such entity and the record and beneficial owners of such
authorized and outstanding capital stock (or other equity interests) and (ii)
for each member of the Commercial Air Group that is a trust, the record and
beneficial owners of the equity interests in such trust.

  

3.3   _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Seller has all
necessary power and authority, and has taken all action necessary, to duly
authorize, execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party, and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Other than corporate approvals of Seller and the members of the
Commercial Air Group, which will be obtained prior to the Closing, no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Seller are necessary to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance in accordance with their respective
terms of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party.
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Seller,
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Purchaser, constitutes a valid, legal and binding agreement of Seller,
enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect
of any applicable Laws relating to bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or preferential transfers, or similar Laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and subject, as to
enforceability, to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at equity or at
Law).

  

3.4   _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. No filing with or
notice to, and no license, permit, waiver, authorization, registration,
consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity is required on the part of
Seller for the execution, delivery and performance by Seller of this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party or the consummation
by Seller of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, the transactions contemplated by the Restructuring Plan,
except (i) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and
under any non-U.S. Antitrust Laws (ii) compliance with any foreign, state or
federal licenses or permits relating to the Business listed on Section 3.4 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule; or (iii) any such filings, notices, licenses,
permits, authorizations,

    

-25-

 



    

registrations, waivers, consents or approvals, the failure to make or obtain
would not give rise to material liabilities, or would not reasonably be
expected to materially impact the operation of the Business. Assuming
compliance with the items described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the
preceding sentence, neither the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Seller nor the consummation by Seller of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, the
transactions contemplated by the Restructuring Plan, will (A) conflict
with or result in any breach, violation or infringement of any provision of
the respective articles of incorporation or bylaws (or similar governing
documents) of Seller or any member of the Commercial Air Group, (B) result in
a breach, violation or infringement of, or constitute (with or without due
notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to the creation of
any Lien, except for Permitted Liens, or any right of termination, amendment,
cancellation or acceleration) under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any Material Contract to which the Seller or any of the members
of the Commercial Air Group is a party or by which they are or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound; or (C) violate or infringe any
Law applicable to any member of the Commercial Air Group or any of their
respective properties or assets, except in the case of each of clauses (B)
and (C) for breaches, violations, infringements, defaults, Liens or other
rights that would not give rise to material liabilities, or would not
reasonably be expected to materially impact the operation of the Business.

  

3.5   _Financial Statements; Liabilities_.

Article IV 
  
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
 OF PURCHASER

  

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered to Seller prior to
the execution of this Agreement (the " _Purchaser Disclosure Schedule_ ") (
_provided_ that disclosure in any section of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule
shall apply to any other section to the extent that the relevance of such
disclosure to such other section is reasonably apparent), Purchaser represents
and warrants to Seller, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date
(except to the extent any such representation and warranty is expressly made
as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date) as follows:

  

4.1   _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Purchaser
is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
the Cayman Islands, and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
being conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a
foreign Person in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation
of its properties or assets or conduct of its business requires such
qualification.

  

4.2   _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Purchaser has all
necessary power and authority, and has taken all action necessary, to duly
authorize, execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party, and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Other than the Parent Shareholder Approval, which will be obtained
prior to the Closing, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates (including Parent) are necessary to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance in accordance with their respective
terms of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party
other than such corporate approvals that have already been obtained as of the
date hereof. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered
by Purchaser and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Seller, constitutes a valid, legal and binding agreement of
Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with its terms,
subject to the effect of any applicable Laws relating to
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,

    

-38-

 



    

moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or preferential transfers, or similar Laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and subject, as to
enforceability, to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at equity or at
Law).

  

4.3   _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. No filing with or
notice to, and no permit, authorization, registration, consent or approval
of, any Governmental Entity is required on the part of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including Parent) for the execution, delivery and performance by
Purchaser of this Agreement or the consummation by Purchaser of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except compliance with the
applicable requirements of the HSR Act and of any non-U.S. Antitrust Laws
listed on Section 4.3 of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule. Assuming
compliance with the items described in the preceding sentence, and except as
would not impair in any material respect the ability of Seller or Purchaser,
as the case may be, to perform their respective obligations under this
Agreement or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Sale, neither
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Purchaser nor
the consummation by Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will (a) conflict with or result in any breach, violation or
infringement of any provision of the respective articles of incorporation or
bylaws (or similar governing documents) of Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries, (b) result in a breach, violation or infringement of, or
constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time, or both) a default
(or give rise to the creation of any Lien, except for Permitted Liens, or any
right of termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration) under, any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to which Purchaser or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of
their respective properties or assets may be bound or (c) violate or infringe
any Law applicable to Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets.

  

4.4   _Financing_.

  

(a)  Purchaser is a party to a fully executed commitment letter
dated October 6, 2016 (as may be amended, restated, amended and restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with
_Section 5.13(b)_ , the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") from the Debt Financing
Sources party thereto (collectively, the " _Lenders_ ") pursuant to which the
Lenders have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide
the debt amounts set forth therein. The debt financing committed pursuant to
the Debt Commitment Letter is collectively referred to in this Agreement as
the " _Debt Financing_."

  

(b)  Purchaser has delivered to Seller true, complete and
correct copies of the executed Debt Commitment Letters and any fee letters
related thereto (collectively, the " _Fee Letters_ "), in each case, as in
effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , that any such Fee Letter may be
redacted as to fee amounts and economic and "market flex" provisions only, in
a manner that is customary for transactions of this type, so long as any
redacted provisions do not affect the availability or aggregate amount of the
Debt Financing (other than the original issue discount provisions as part of
the flex terms of the Fee Letter).

  

(c)  Except as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Lenders
to provide the Debt Financing or any

    

-39-

 



    

contingencies that would permit the Lenders to reduce the total amount of the
Debt Financing, including pursuant to any "flex" provision. Assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ , as of
the date hereof, Purchaser does not have any reason to believe that it
will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all terms and conditions to be
satisfied by it in the Debt Commitment Letter on or prior to the Closing Date
(taking into account the anticipated timing of the Marketing Period), nor to
the Knowledge of Purchaser will any of the Lenders not perform its
obligations thereunder. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side
letters, understandings or other agreements, contracts or arrangements of any
kind relating to the Debt Commitment Letter that could affect the
availability of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
(other than the original issue discount provisions as part of the flex terms
of the Fee Letter).

  

(d)  Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ , the Debt Financing, when combined with the Escrow
Amount and the funds available to Purchaser as guaranteed under the Guaranty,
shall provide Purchaser with aggregate cash proceeds on the Closing Date
sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Purchaser's payment obligations
under this Agreement and under the Debt Commitment Letters required to be
paid on the Closing Date, including the payment of the Purchase Price,
and for any repayment or refinancing of any outstanding Indebtedness of
Purchaser, its Subsidiaries and the Commercial Air Group contemplated by this
Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letters (collectively, the " _Financing Uses_
").

  

(e)  As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter is a
legal, valid and binding obligations of Purchaser (or its
applicable Affiliate) and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, all other parties
thereto, and is in in full force and effect, and enforceable in accordance
with their terms, except that (i) enforceability may be limited by the
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium or similar Laws from time to time in effect affecting generally the
enforcement of creditors' rights and remedies and principles of equity and
(ii) the availability of equitable remedies, including specific performance,
is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding may be
brought. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions to Purchaser's obligation to consummate the Sale, (i) no event
has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both)
constitutes a default or breach by Purchaser under the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letter and (ii) Purchaser does not have any reason to believe that
any of the conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing will not
be satisfied on a timely basis or that the Financing will not be available to
Purchaser on the date that the Closing is required to occur hereunder.
Purchaser has paid (or caused to be paid) in full any and all commitment fees
or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letters on or before the date of this Agreement, and will pay (or
cause to be paid) in full any such amounts required to be paid pursuant to
the terms thereof on or before the Closing Date. As of the date of
this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter has not been modified, amended or
altered, and none of the respective commitments under the Debt Commitment
Letter has been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect, and, to the Knowledge
of Purchaser, no withdrawal or rescission thereof is contemplated. As of the
date of this Agreement, no modification or amendment to the Debt Commitment
Letters is currently contemplated.

    

-40-

 



    

(f)  In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds
or financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Debt Financing) by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any other financing or other
transactions be a condition to any of Purchaser's obligations under this
Agreement.

  

4.5   _Solvency_. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_ , Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, on
a consolidated basis, will be Solvent immediately following the Closing Date.
For purposes of this _Section 4.5_ , " _Solvent_ " means, with respect to any
Person, on a consolidated basis, that:

  

(a)  the fair saleable value (determined on a going concern
basis) of the assets of such Person shall be greater than the total amount of
such Person's liabilities (including all liabilities, whether or not reflected
in a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, and whether direct or
indirect, fixed or contingent, secured or unsecured, disputed or undisputed);

  

(b)  such Person shall be able to pay its debts and obligations
in the ordinary course of business as they become due; and

  

(c)  such Person shall have adequate capital to carry on its
businesses and all businesses in which it is about to engage.

  

4.6   _Litigation_. There is no civil, criminal or administrative
Action pending, or to the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened, against
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including Parent) which would reasonably
be expected to prevent, materially hinder or delay any of the transactions
contemplated hereby and neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including
Parent) is subject to any outstanding Order, writ or injunction which would
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially hinder or delay any of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

4.7   _Broker's Fees_. Except for brokerage, finder's or other
fees or commissions paid solely by Purchaser and any of its Affiliates
(including Parent), no broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any
brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including Parent).

  

4.8   _Acquisition of Shares for Investment_. Purchaser has such
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as is required for
evaluating the merits and risks of its purchase of the Shares and is capable
of such evaluation. Purchaser confirms that Seller has made available to
Purchaser and Purchaser's agents and representatives the opportunity to ask
questions of the officers, management and employees of Seller and of the
members of the Commercial Air Group, as well as access to the
documents, information and records of Seller and the members of the
Commercial Air Group and to acquire additional information about the
business and financial condition of the Business, and Purchaser confirms that
it has made an independent investigation, analysis and evaluation of members
of the Commercial Air Group and their properties, assets, business, financial
condition, prospects, documents, information and records. Purchaser is
acquiring the Shares for investment and not with a view toward or for sale in
connection with any distribution thereof, or with any present intention of
distributing or selling the Shares. Purchaser acknowledges that the Shares
have not been registered under the

    

-41-

 



    

Securities Act or any other state, foreign or local securities Laws, and
agrees that the Shares may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale,
pledged, distributed, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without
registration under the Securities Act, except pursuant to an exemption from
such registration available under the Securities Act, and without compliance
with any other federal, state, foreign or local securities Laws, in each case,
to the extent applicable.

  

4.9   _Inspections; Limitation of Seller's Warranties_. Except as
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, Purchaser acknowledges that
the Shares, the Business and the businesses and properties of the members of
the Commercial Air Group are furnished "AS IS, WHERE IS" AND, SUBJECT TO THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN _ARTICLE III_ , WITH ALL FAULTS
AND WITHOUT ANY OTHER REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, AND IN PARTICULAR, WITHOUT ANY IMPLIED
WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION AS TO CONDITION, MERCHANTABILITY OR SUITABILITY AS
TO ANY OF THE ASSETS OR PROPERTIES OF THE COMMERCIAL AIR GROUP. Except as
provided in this Agreement, none of Seller, any of its respective Affiliates
or any other Person will have or be subject to any liability or
indemnification obligation to Purchaser or any other Person resulting from
the distribution to Purchaser, or Purchaser's (or its Affiliates' or their
representatives') use of, any information provided to Purchaser or its
Affiliates or representatives, including any information, documents,
projections, forecasts or other material made available in the Data Room or
management presentations in expectation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or otherwise.

  

4.10   _Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Purchaser has delivered to Seller a true, complete and correct copy of the
executed Guaranty. The Guaranty is valid, binding and enforceable in
accordance with its terms, and is in full force and effect. No event has
occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a failure to
satisfy a condition precedent on the part of the Guarantor under the terms and
conditions of the Guaranty.

  

4.11   _Parent Voting Agreement_. Concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement, Purchaser has delivered to Seller a true, complete and
correct copy of the Parent Voting Agreement. The Parent Voting Agreement is

representations and warranties contained in _Article III_ hereof and in
Section 4 of the Canadian Purchase Agreement, Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that neither Seller nor any other Person on behalf of Seller has made,
and Purchaser has not relied upon, any representation or warranty, whether
express or implied, with respect to Seller or the members of the Commercial
Air Group or their respective businesses, affairs, assets, liabilities,
financial condition or results of operations or with respect to the accuracy
or completeness of any other information provided or made available to
Purchaser by or on behalf of Seller. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that
neither Seller nor any other Person on behalf of Seller has made any
representation or warranty, whether express or implied, with respect to the
future operating or financial results, estimates, projections, forecasts,

plans or prospects (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or
prospects) of Seller or the Commercial Air Group, either before or after the
Closing Date.

 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  

5.1   _Access to Books and Records_.

  

(a)  From the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, Seller
shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the Commercial Air Group to), to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, afford to the officers, directors,
employees, accountants, consultants, financial and legal advisors, and other
authorized representatives (collectively, the " _Representatives_ ") of
Purchaser reasonable access to the books and records of the members of the
Commercial Air Group during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice
from Purchaser and in accordance with reasonable procedures established by
Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Seller shall make available, or
cause the members of the Commercial Air Group to make available, Business
Employee personnel files only if and when Purchaser provides Seller with
notice that the applicable Business Employee has provided Purchaser with a
release permitting transfer of those files, and Purchaser shall hold Seller
harmless from any Losses arising out of or relating to the transfer of such
personnel files; (ii) prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not conduct
any sampling of soil, sediment, surface water, ground water or building
material at, on, under or within any facility on the Leased Real Property; and
(iii) neither Seller nor any member of the Commercial Air Group shall be
required to provide access to or disclose information where, upon the advice
of counsel, such access or disclosure would reasonably be likely to violate
any obligation of confidentiality to which a Seller or any member of the
Commercial Air Group may be subject, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege
of such Person or contravene any applicable Laws, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if any information is withheld pursuant to this _Section 5.1(a)(iii)_
, Seller may only withhold such portion of the information that is reasonably
necessary to be withheld in order to preserve such privilege or work product
protection or comply with such confidentiality obligations or applicable Laws
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide extracts or
summaries of any protected information or otherwise provide such protected
information, in any case in a manner that would not jeopardize the applicable
protection or violate such confidentiality obligation or applicable Law.

  

(b)  Purchaser agrees that any permitted investigation
undertaken by Purchaser pursuant to the access granted under _Section 5.1(a)_
shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
operation of the Business or any other business of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, and Purchaser and its Representatives shall not communicate with
any of the employees of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  

(c)  To the extent that any books and records (excluding Tax
records and Tax Returns, which are governed by _Section 7.6(b)_ ) which
relate exclusively to the Business and the Company Air Group are in the

possession of a member of the Commercial Air Group at the Closing Date, Seller
shall use

    

-43-

 



    

commercially reasonable efforts to procure the physical and/or electronic
transfer of the books and records to the Purchaser or its nominee on the
Closing Date or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date. If,
notwithstanding the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, Seller is not
able to procure such physical and/or electronic transfer on the Closing Date,
then Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect such
transfer as soon as reasonably practicable and until such transfer is
effected, shall procure that the Purchaser is granted reasonable access to
such books and records, during regular business hours upon reasonable notice
and in accordance with reasonable procedures established by Seller.

  

(d)  Purchaser agrees to hold all the books and records of each
member of the Commercial Air Group existing on the Closing Date and not to
destroy or dispose of any thereof for a period of six (6) years from the

shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to afford Seller and its
Representatives, during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice and
subject to entering into a customary confidentiality agreement, such access as
is reasonably required by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries for legitimate
business reasons and does not violate any applicable Law or any
confidentiality obligations applicable to the Commercial Air Group or
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that if Purchaser restricts access to Seller and/or its
Representatives pursuant to the preceding clause because such access would
violate applicable Law or confidentiality obligations, Purchaser may only
restrict access to the portion of the information in the books and records
that is reasonably necessary to be withheld in order to comply with such
applicable Laws or confidentiality obligations, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide extracts or summaries of any information in the
books and records or otherwise provide such information, in any case in a
manner that would not violate such confidentiality obligation or applicable
Law.

including defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in
any court with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private
party; and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
applicable Law so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as possible (and

negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such
businesses, product lines or assets of Purchaser and the members of the

or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of Purchaser or the members
of the Commercial Air Group, and (z) agreeing to divest, sell, dispose of,
hold separate, or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its

ability to operate or retain, any of the businesses, product lines or assets
of Purchaser or the members of the Commercial Air Group; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that any action contemplated by clauses (x), (y) and (z) is

Section 5.8(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or any other guarantee,
indemnity, surety bond, letter of credit, bank guarantee, keepwell agreement,
consumer financing arrangements, or other similar commitment, understanding,
agreement or obligation relating to the Business entered into or arising on or

reasonable efforts (including renegotiating the material terms of the

in each case under this _Section 5.8(b)_  at Seller's sole cost and expense,
to cause itself or the members of the Commercial Air Group to be substituted
in all respects for each member of the Seller Group, and for each member of

the Seller Group under each of the Indemnified Guarantees. In furtherance and
not in limitation of the preceding sentence, at Seller's request, Purchaser
shall, and shall cause the members of the Commercial Air Group to, assign or
cause to be assigned, any lease underlying an Indemnified Guarantee to an
Affiliate of Purchaser meeting the applicable net worth and other

sentence. For any Indemnified Guarantees for which Purchaser or the members
of the Commercial Air Group, as applicable, is not substituted in all respects

Group is not released) effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall
continue to use commercially reasonable efforts and shall cause the members
of the Commercial Air Group to use commercially reasonable efforts to effect
such substitution and release as promptly as practicable after the Closing,
and Seller shall continue to reasonably cooperate in Purchaser's efforts.

shall extend or renew any Contract containing or underlying an Indemnified
Guarantee unless, prior to or concurrently with such extension or
renewal, Purchaser or a member of the Commercial Air Group is substituted in
all respects for the applicable member(s) of the Seller Group, and the

Group for any and all amounts paid, including all reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred in maintaining such Indemnified

Indemnified Guarantee for each member of the Seller Group prior to the
Closing. Purchaser further agrees that, to the extent the beneficiary or
counterparty under any Indemnified Guarantee does not accept any such
substitute arrangement proffered by Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser or
to the extent each member of the Seller Group is not fully and irrevocably
released and discharged, Purchaser agrees to promptly reimburse each member of
the Seller Group to the extent any Indemnified Guarantee is called upon as a
result of or in connection with an event, claim or circumstance occurring
after the Closing Date and such member of the Seller Group makes any payment
or is obligated to reimburse the Party issuing such Indemnified Guarantee.

of the Commercial Air Group shall cease to be insured by the policies or

Subsidiaries other than any Insurance Arrangements held directly by and in
the name of any member of the Commercial Air Group (the " _Seller Insurance
Policies_ "), and neither Purchaser nor its Subsidiaries (including, after the
Closing, the members of the Commercial Air Group) shall have any access,
right, title or interest to or in Seller Insurance Policies (including to all
claims and rights to make claims and all rights to proceeds) to cover any
assets of the members of the Commercial Air Group or any Liability
arising from the operation of the Business on or after the Closing;

Commercial Air Group shall remain entitled to all rights, to the extent

existed prior to the Closing Date (and then only to the extent that such
claim, act, omission, event, loss or allegation of wrongful act occurred or
existed prior to the Closing Date) (a " _Pre-Closing Date Event_ "), and (ii)
to the extent Purchaser so requests, members of the Seller Group shall file
and use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue on behalf of the Commercial
Air Group claims made under occurrence-based Seller Insurance Policies that
were in effect at any time prior to the Closing (the " _Policies_ "), in
respect of any loss or liability suffered by a member of the Commercial Air
Group to the extent insured under any Policy and to the extent arising from
an act, omission, occurrence or loss prior to the Closing Date, and shall
provide Purchaser with the net proceeds realized with respect to such claims;
_provided_ , _further_ , that (a) Purchaser agrees to reimburse, upon the
request of Seller, the applicable members of the Seller Group for all direct
costs (other than the Seller's own salary costs) incurred after the Closing
Date by any member of the Seller Group associated with pursuing such
Purchaser-initiated claims, including costs of filing a claim and arbitration
costs, and (b) with respect to any claims referenced in the foregoing

Seller of and reasonably cooperate with Seller in pursuing all such claims.
Seller or any of its respective Affiliates may, to be effective as of (but not
prior to) the Closing, amend any Seller Insurance Policies in the manner it
deems appropriate to give effect to this _Section 5.9_. From and after the
Closing, Purchaser shall be responsible for securing all insurance it
considers appropriate for its operation of the Commercial Air Group and
the Business. Other than as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.9_ ,
Purchaser further covenants and agrees not to seek to

    

-52-

 



    

assert or to exercise any rights or claims of any member of the Commercial
Air Group or the Business under or in respect of any past or current Seller
Insurance Policy under which any member of the Commercial Air Group or the
Business is an additional insured.

  

5.10   _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as Seller
or any of its Affiliates is prosecuting, contesting, defending, conducting or
responding to any legal proceeding, Action, investigation, hearing, charge,
claim or demand in connection with any fact, situation, circumstance, status,
condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action,
failure to act, or transaction relating to any Action identified on Section
5.10 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries (and its and their officers and employees) to, reasonably
cooperate with Seller, its Affiliates and their counsel in such prosecution,
contest, defense, conduct or response including making available its
personnel, and provide such testimony, information and access to its books
and records as shall be reasonably necessary in connection therewith, all at
the sole cost and expense of the Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this

the other hand.

(a)  Purchaser shall take, or use reasonable efforts to cause to

all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the proceeds of the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter
on or prior to the date upon which the Closing is required to occur pursuant
to the terms hereof, taking into account the anticipated timing of the
Marketing Period, including by (i) using reasonable efforts to maintain in
effect the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiating definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing (the " _Definitive Agreements_ ") consistent
with the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter
(including, as necessary, any modifications, adjustments or amendments
thereto pursuant to the "flex" provisions contained in any Fee Letter), or on
other terms which do not (x) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing
such that the aggregate funds available to Purchaser at

    

-56-

 



    

Closing would not be sufficient to satisfy the Financing Uses or (y) impose
new or additional conditions precedent (other than conditions precedent that
have already been satisfied at the time they are so added) or adversely
modify any existing conditions precedent to the receipt of the Debt Financing
and (iii) satisfying on a timely basis (taking into account the anticipated
timing of the Marketing Period) all conditions precedent to funding of
the Debt Financing applicable to Purchaser in the Debt Commitment Letter and
the Definitive Agreements. In the event that all conditions contained in any
Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements (other than the availability of
the Escrow Amount, the funds available to Purchaser as guaranteed under the
Guaranty or any other funds of Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof) have been
satisfied, Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Debt Financing
Sources to comply with their respective obligations, including to fund the
Debt Financing required to finance the Financing Uses in full. Purchaser shall
give Seller prompt written notice of (i) any termination or repudiation of
the Debt Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreements by any party thereto of
which Purchaser has Knowledge or (ii) any breach or default of the Debt
Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreements by any party thereto of which
Purchaser has Knowledge that could reasonably be expected to (A) materially
and adversely affect the ability or likelihood of Purchaser to
timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) make
the timely funding of the Debt Financing or satisfaction of the conditions
precedent to obtaining the Debt Financing prior to or substantially
concurrently with the Closing less likely to occur.

  

(b)  Purchaser shall not, without the prior written consent of
Seller: (A) permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter if such amendment,
modification, waiver or remedy (1) adds new (or adversely modifies any
existing) conditions to the consummation of all or any portion of the Debt
Financing, (2) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, (3)
adversely affects in any material respect the ability of Purchaser to enforce
its rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Definitive Agreements as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise
modified, relative to the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights against
the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date
hereof or (4) could otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or
materially delay the consummation of the Sale and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that Purchaser may (i)
amend, restate, amend and restate, supplement, modify or replace the Debt
Commitment Letter to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities, and (ii) subject to the limitations
set forth in this _Section 5.13(b)_ , otherwise amend or modify, grant any
waiver of any provision or remedy under, or increase the amount of
indebtedness or otherwise replace the Debt Commitment Letter or one or more
facilities; or (B) terminate any Debt Commitment Letter. Purchaser
shall promptly deliver to Seller copies of any such amendment, modification,
waiver or replacement following full execution and delivery thereof, in each
case, to the extent entered into prior to Closing; _provided_ that any
amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of the Fee Letter may be
redacted as to fee amounts and economic and "market flex" provisions only,
in a manner that is customary for transactions of this type, so long as any
redacted provisions do not affect the availability or aggregate amount of the
Debt Financing (other than the original issue discount provisions as part of
the flex terms of the Fee Letters).

  

(c)  In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, Purchaser will (A) promptly
notify Seller of such unavailability and the reason therefor and (B) use
reasonable efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (in an

    

-57-

 



    

amount sufficient, when taken together with the available portion of the Debt
Financing, the Escrow Amount and the funds available to Purchaser as
guaranteed under the Guaranty, to fund all of the Financing Uses) (an "
_Alternative Financing_ ") from the same or other sources and which do not
include any conditions to the consummation of such Alternative Financing that
are materially more onerous than the conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing,
in the event that (1) any portion of the Debt Financing structured as bond
financing is unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, (2) all
conditions contained in  _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_ shall be satisfied
or waived (other than any such conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions at the Closing) and the Marketing Period has expired as of the
date on which the Closing would otherwise be required to occur and (3) the
bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (or alternative
bridge facilities obtained in accordance with this _Section 5.13(c)_ ) are
available on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter
(or replacements thereof), then Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to
cause the proceeds of such bridge financing to be used immediately in lieu of
such affected portion of the bond financing. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Debt Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include any
commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any Alternative
Financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Debt Commitment
Letter remaining in effect at the time in question). Purchaser shall keep
Seller reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its
efforts to consummate the Debt Financing. The foregoing notwithstanding,
compliance by Purchaser with this _Section 5.13_ shall not relieve Purchaser
of its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement whether or not the Debt Financing is available.

  

(d)  Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the
Commercial Air Group to, and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause its
and their respective officers, employees, consultants and other
representatives (including legal and accounting representatives) to, provide
all cooperation reasonably requested by Purchaser necessary, proper or
advisable for the arrangement of the Debt Financing (provided that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries), including by:

  

(i)  causing the management team and representatives (with
appropriate seniority and expertise) of Seller and the Commercial Air Group
to assist in preparation for, and participate in, a reasonable number of
meetings, conference calls, drafting sessions, presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions and similar sessions with prospective Debt Financing
Sources and other proposed lenders, legal counsel, underwriters, initial
purchasers, placement agents and potential investors, and in sessions with
rating agencies, upon reasonable advance notice and at reasonable times and
mutually agreed places;

  

(ii)  assisting Purchaser with its preparation of pro forma
financial information and pro forma financial statements and materials for
rating agency presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda,
registration statements, bank information memoranda, prospectuses, business
projections and similar documents used in connection with the Debt Financing
and executing and delivering customary authorization letters and management
representation letters in connection therewith;

    

-58-

 



    

(iii)  using reasonable efforts to cause the Transferred Company's
independent accountants to provide assistance and cooperation to Purchaser in
connection with the Debt Financing, including participating in a reasonable
number of drafting sessions and accounting due diligence sessions at
reasonable times and mutually agreed places, assisting in the preparation of
any pro forma financial statements to be included in the documents referred
to in _clause (ii)_ of this _Section 5.13(d)_ , providing consents to
Purchaser to use their audit reports relating to the Transferred Company and
providing a draft of any customary "comfort letters" (which, for the
avoidance of doubt will be in accordance with American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (" _AICPA_ ") Statement on Auditing Standards 72) __ prior
to the beginning of the Marketing Period, which such accountants would be
prepared to issue at the time of pricing and at closing of any offering or
private placement of the Debt Financing (in the form of debt securities)
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act;

  

(iv)  assisting in the preparation, negotiation, execution and
delivery of definitive financing documentation and the schedules and exhibits
thereto (including loan agreements, indentures, pledge and security documents,
guarantees, hedging arrangements, legal opinions and certificates, management
representation letters and other documents and back-up therefor) and otherwise
facilitating the pledging of collateral by the Commercial Air Group effective
as of the Closing Date;

  

(v)  requesting and cooperating in obtaining customary lien
terminations and instruments of discharge and the return of any
possessory collateral relating to any Indebtedness of the Commercial Air
Group (other than any Indebtedness assigned or transferred to, or otherwise
assumed by Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Purchaser as of Closing, pursuant
to _Section 5.19_ );

  

(vi)  cooperating with customary due diligence review of the
Commercial Air Group, including by providing reasonable access
during business hours at mutually agreed times to Purchaser and any Debt
Financing Sources, and their respective officers, employees, consultants and
representatives to information required in connection with the Debt Financing;

  

(vii)  furnishing to Purchaser and the Debt Financing Sources, as
promptly as practicable following a request therefor, all financial and other
information regarding the Transferred Company and the Business as may be
reasonably requested by Purchaser and as is customary to be included in
marketing materials for senior secured or unsecured non-convertible high-yield
debt securities or bridge, term or revolving facility indebtedness, as
applicable (or customary documentation and deliverables in connection
therewith), including (A) the historical financial statements of the
Transferred Company that are required by paragraphs 6(a) and 6(b) of Exhibit D
to the Debt Commitment Letter (which the Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide on or prior to November 30, 2016), (B) all
historical financial statements and historical financial data of the
Transferred Company, in each case (1) prepared in accordance with GAAP and
(2) that would be required by Regulation S-X under the Securities Act and any
other accounting rules and regulations of the SEC for inclusion in a
registration statement to be filed with the SEC with respect to debt
securities of Purchaser (as of and for the periods

    

-59-

 



    

required thereby) if Purchaser were acquiring the Transferred Company as a
business, and such other customary information to be included therein (in each
case subject to exceptions customary for a private placement of secured or
unsecured non-convertible high-yield debt securities pursuant to Rule 144A
promulgated under the Securities Act, including any information that would be
required by (i) Rules 3-09, 3-10 and 3-16 of Regulation S-X, (ii) Item 402 of
Regulation S-K and (iii) information regarding executive compensation and
related party disclosure related to SEC Release Nos. 33-8732A, 34-54302A and

an offering of secured or unsecured non-convertible high-yield
debt securities pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act)
"comfort" from the Transferred Company's independent accountants in
connection with such an offering of debt securities (all such information
described in clauses (A) through (C) of this _Section 5.13(d)(vii)_ together
with any replacements or restatements thereof and any supplements thereto if
any such information would cease to be Compliant, the " _Required Financial
Information_ "); and

  

(viii)  furnishing Purchaser and its Debt Financing Sources promptly,
and in any event at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, with
all documentation and other information about the Commercial Air Group
required by regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and

Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept
and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA Patriot Act) of 2001 that is
reasonably requested in writing by any Debt Financing Source through the
Purchaser at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing.

  

The foregoing notwithstanding, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to take, cause to be taken or permit the taking of any
action pursuant to this _Section 5.13(d)_  that would: (A) require Seller,
its Subsidiaries or any Persons who are directors of Seller or its
Subsidiaries to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the

existing certificate, document, instrument or agreement, (B) cause any

Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (H) require Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries to enter into any instrument, certificate, document or
agreement, in each case other than the Commercial Air Group upon the Closing
(and other than such customary management representation letters and
authorization letters referred to in _clause (ii)_ of this _Section 5.13(d)_
). Nothing contained in this _Section 5.13(d)_ or otherwise shall require
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to be an issuer or other obligor with
respect to the Debt Financing (other than the Commercial Air Group upon the
Closing).

    

-60-

 



    

(e)  Purchaser shall, upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, employees, consultants
and other representatives in connection with such cooperation. Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Subsidiaries and their respective
officers, employees, consultants and other representatives from and against
any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing, any action taken by them at the request of
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 5.13(d)_ and any information used in
connection therewith (other than information provided in writing by or on
behalf of Seller or its Subsidiaries specifically in connection with its
obligations pursuant to _Section 5.13(d)_ ), in each case other than to the
extent any of the foregoing arises from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

(f)  Seller consents to the reasonable use of the Transferred
Company's logos in connection with any Debt Financing in a manner customary
for such financing transactions; _provided_ that such logos are used solely in
a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage
the Transferred Company or the reputation or goodwill of the Commercial Air
Group.

  

(g)  For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that the provisions contained in this _Section_   _5.13_ represent
the sole obligation of Seller, its Subsidiaries and their respective
representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of any financing (including any Debt Financing) to be obtained by
Purchaser with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
no other provision of this Agreement (including the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto) shall be deemed to expand or modify such obligations.

  

5.14   _CIT Marks_.

  

(a)  Purchaser, for itself and its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the members of the Commercial Air Group), acknowledges and
agrees that Purchaser is not purchasing, acquiring or otherwise obtaining any
right, title or interest in or to the CIT Marks, and, except as provided in
_Section 5.14(b)_ and _Section 5.14(c)_ , (i) neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the members of the Commercial Air
Group) shall have any rights in or to the CIT Marks, (ii) on the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall cause the members of the Commercial Air Group to no
longer hold themselves out as affiliated with Seller and cease any and all
use of the CIT Marks (including in the respective corporate or other legal
names of the members of the Commercial Air Group), and (iii) neither
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the members
of the Commercial Air Group) shall use, register or seek to use or register
in any jurisdiction any of the CIT Marks or any other Marks confusingly
similar thereto.

  

(b)  For a phase-out period not to exceed nine (9) months
immediately following the Closing Date or such shorter or longer period as
required by applicable Law or Order (the " _Phase-out Period_ ") Seller grants
the Commercial Air Group a worldwide, royalty-free, non-transferrable, non-
exclusive license to use the CIT Marks to the extent such CIT Marks appear on
or are incorporated in the corporate or other legal name of any member of the
Commercial Air Group or in any existing tangible materials acquired
by Purchaser under this

    

-61-

 



    

Agreement in the same manner as used by the members of the Commercial Air
Group prior to the Closing Date and, in each case, solely as necessary to wind
down the use of, and transition away from, such CIT Marks. For the avoidance
of doubt, during the Phase-out Period, Purchaser shall not (and shall cause
its Affiliates, including, after the Closing, the members of the Commercial
Air Group, not to) print, copy or create any selling,
advertising, promotional or marketing materials (including, in each case,
printed materials and electronic materials) bearing or incorporating the CIT
Marks. At the end of such Phase-out Period, Purchaser shall (and shall cause
its Affiliates, including, after the Closing, the members of the Commercial
Air Group, to) have used its and their reasonable best efforts to have re-
labelled, destroyed or exhausted all materials bearing or incorporating the
CIT Marks, including signage, advertising, promotional materials,
Software, packaging, inventory, electronic materials, collateral goods,
stationery, business cards, websites and other materials, and have made all
filings with any office, agency or body to effect the elimination of any use
of the CIT Marks in the Business (including in the respective corporate or
other legal names of the members of the Commercial Air Group), so as to bring
Purchaser and its Affiliates, including, after the Closing, the members of
the Commercial Air Group, into compliance with this _Section 5.14(b)_
, except to the extent that adhering to the provisions of this _Section
5.14(b)_ would require the payment by Purchaser or its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the members of the Commercial Air Group) in excess of
$100,000, in the aggregate, to change the CIT Marks, including, without
limitation in connection with any requirement to change or replace the CIT
Mark under which an aircraft is registered, or (ii) require the consent or
cooperation of a Third Party which is not forthcoming so long as Purchaser
and its Affiliates have used their reasonable best efforts, in consultation
with Seller and its Affiliates, to obtain such consent or cooperation.
Following the end of the Phase-out Period, if Seller or any of its Affiliates
discover any incident of usage of the CIT Marks by Purchaser or its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the members of the Commercial Air
Group) in violation of this _Section 5.14(b)_ , upon receipt of notice from
Seller, Purchaser shall or shall cause its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the members of the Commercial Air Group), as applicable, to promptly
destroy or re-label the relevant materials incorporating the CIT Marks and
shall certify (pursuant to a certificate signed by an authorized officer of
Purchaser) the completion of such destruction or re-labeling. After the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates, including
after Closing, the members of the Commercial Air Group, not to) represent that
it has the authority to bind Seller or any of its Affiliates.

  

(c)  Commercial Air Group may at all times after the Closing
Date (i) retain and use, for Commercial Air Group's internal business
purposes, records and other historical or archived documents containing or
referencing the CIT Marks; (ii) use the CIT Marks to the extent required by
or permitted as a fair use under applicable Law; and (iii) reference that
Purchaser "acquired the commercial aircraft leasing business of CIT Group
Inc." or other words to that effect on their websites and in
their advertising, marketing and promotional materials.

  

5.15   _Restructuring_.

  

(a)  Seller shall complete in all material respects the
transactions set forth in steps 1 through 6 of the Restructuring Plan (such
date of completion the " _Restructuring Phase I Completion Date_ ") by
January 20, 2017; _provided_ , that Seller shall have no obligation to
complete the transactions set forth in step 5 of the Restructuring Plan, or
any subsequent steps in the Restructuring Plan, unless the Subsequent Deposit
has been made by Purchaser with the

    

-62-

 



    

Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section 2.8_. Seller shall complete in all
material respects the transactions set forth in steps 7 through 9 of the
Restructuring Plan prior to Closing. Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate to
complete in all material respects the transactions set forth in steps 10 and
14 of the Restructuring Plan immediately prior to the Canadian Closing.
Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate to complete in all material respects the
transactions set forth in steps 12 and 13 of the Restructuring Plan after the
Canadian Closing. Without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which
consent shall not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, Seller
shall not amend the Restructuring Plan.

  

(b)  Notwithstanding the transactions contemplated by step 8 of
the Restructuring Plan, following the date hereof and prior to the Closing
Date, Seller and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
negotiate in good faith to mutually agree to repay the ECA Indebtedness as
described in step 8 of the Restructuring Plan or as otherwise mutually agreed
alternative (the " _ECA Repayment_ "); _provided_ that Seller shall not be
required to agree to any ECA Repayment option that Seller determines could
impair or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or that Seller determines could have an adverse effect on Seller or
its Affiliates (after giving effect to any proposal by Purchaser to hold
Seller harmless from such adverse effect). If Seller and Purchaser mutually
agree to implement an ECA Repayment alternative, then step 8 of the
Restructuring Plan shall be modified accordingly and Seller and Purchaser
shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the ECA Repayment. If Seller and Purchaser do
not reach mutual agreement then step 8 of the Restructuring Plan shall not be
modified.

practicable and legally permitted upon the receipt of any comments from the
SZSE or any Governmental Entity with respect to, or any request from the

2016 of C2 Aviation Capital, Inc. and its subsidiaries, conducted in
accordance with the standards of the AICPA (the " _Audited Interim Financial
Statements_ ") on or prior to January 20, 2017, but in any event no later

liabilities and business as presented in the C2 Form 10 (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the financial statement data derived from Seller's
interest in the JV Shares). The Audited Interim Financial Statements shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP and will include footnotes in the
form substantially similar to those included in the audited financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 presented in the C2 Form 10,
other than those footnotes related to income tax, which will be prepared on
the basis of an annual estimated effective tax rate. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Audited Interim Financial Statements shall not be required to

months

Financial Statements to Purchaser on or prior to January 25, 2017 or (y) the
Restructuring Phase I Completion Date has not occurred on or prior to January
20, 2017, then Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent
an audited combined balance sheet at December 31, 2016 and related combined
statement of income, comprehensive income, changes in parent company net
investment and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016 of C2
Aviation Capital, Inc. and its subsidiaries, conducted in accordance with the
standards of the AICPA (the " _2016 Audited Financial Statements_ ") on or
prior to April 21, 2017. The scope of the 2016 Audited Financial Statements

financial statement data derived from Seller's interest in the JV Shares).
The 2016 Audited Financial Statements shall be prepared in accordance with
GAAP and will include footnotes in the form substantially similar to those
included in the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2015 presented in the C2 Form 10. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 2016
Audited Financial Statements shall not be required to include comparative
information for any prior periods, including the year ended December
31, 2015. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the
2016 Audited Financial Statements with an unqualified audit opinion;
_provided_ , however, that the delivery of the 2016 Audited Financial
Statements with a qualified audit opinion will satisfy Seller's obligations
under this _Section 5.17(b)_.

  

5.18   _Parent Shareholder Meeting_. As promptly as practicable
following the receipt of the SZSE Approval, but in any event no later than
the seventeenth (17th) calendar day after receipt of the SZSE Approval, Parent
shall hold the Parent Shareholder Meeting and shall not postpone or adjourn
the Parent Shareholder Meeting without Seller's prior written consent. The
Parent Board shall recommend in the Parent Shareholder Notice and at the
Parent Shareholder Meeting that its shareholders vote in favor of approving
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Agreement at the
Parent Shareholder Meeting and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval. The Parent Board shall not withdraw,
amend, modify, alter or otherwise change such recommendation in any manner
adverse to Seller. Except as may be expressly required by the SZSE,
applicable Law or the corporate organizational documents of Parent to obtain
the SZSE Approval, Parent shall not amend, modify, alter or otherwise make
any changes to the Parent Shareholder Notice (and any such amendment,
modification, alteration or other change shall not affect the timing
requirements provided in the first sentence of this paragraph); _provided_ ,
_that_ , Seller and its counsel shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any such amendment or modification and Parent shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to such comments. For the avoidance
of doubt, any communications from Parent or its Affiliates related to the
Parent Shareholder Meeting shall be made in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 5.6_.

  

5.19   _Commercial Air Group Indebtedness_. Purchaser will co-operate
with Seller and provide all necessary information and assistance reasonably
required by Seller from Purchaser if Seller elects to seek any third-party
consents or approvals (the " _Specified Indebtedness_

    

-65-

 



    

 _Consents_ ") necessary for the Indebtedness set forth on Section 5.19 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the " _Specified Indebtedness_ ") to be
assigned or transferred to, or otherwise assumed by, Purchaser or an
Affiliate of Purchaser as of the Closing. If some or all of the Specified
Indebtedness Consents are obtained after the date hereof but by December 31,
2016, Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser shall, as of Closing, assume all
or such portion of the Specified Indebtedness for which the Specified
Indebtedness Consents have been timely obtained, including all rights and
obligations thereunder, and Seller and its Affiliates and their respective
assets shall be released from all liabilities, liens and obligations with
respect to such assumed Specified Indebtedness. If Purchaser or an Affiliate
of Purchaser assumes all or a portion of the Specified Indebtedness, Seller
will reimburse Purchaser for any commitment fees incurred and actually paid
by Purchaser in respect of the portion of the Debt Financing that would have
been necessary to repay the full principal amount of such assumed Specified
Indebtedness; _provided_ , that Seller shall not be required to reimburse
Purchaser for an amount greater than $1,500,000. Seller shall cause to be
repaid in full at or prior to Closing all Commercial Air Group
Indebtedness and shall deliver the documents set forth in _Section
2.3(b)(iv)(E)_ in connection therewith at Closing other than
Specified Indebtedness for which Specified Indebtedness Consents have been
obtained by December 31, 2016. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall
not adversely modify the terms of any Commercial Air Group Indebtedness that
is to be assigned or transferred to, or otherwise assumed by, Purchaser or an
Affiliate of Purchaser as of the Closing pursuant to this Section 5.19 without
the prior written consent of Purchaser.

  



  

5.20   _Leases and Subleases_.

party to the lease in Section 5.20(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to

acceptable to Seller and the Purchaser.

  

(b)  Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at
Purchaser's expense, to obtain the required consents to effect an assignment

Purchaser.

(a)  The Parties agree that Purchaser will not be acquiring the
JV Shares that are reflected in the Financial Statements (and that will be
reflected in the Audited Interim Financial Statements) pursuant to this
Agreement. Accordingly, the Purchase Price will not include the book value of
the JV Shares.

  

5.22   _Canadian Bump_. From and after the date of this Agreement,
and for a period of 36 months following the Closing, the Seller undertakes
that the Seller, any Person that controls

    

-66-

 



    

the Seller, directly or indirectly and any Person that the Seller controls,
directly or indirectly (a " _Controlled Specified Shareholder_ ")

  

(a)  Will not knowingly, or through failure to take reasonable
care, own, purchase or acquire, directly or indirectly, any
shares, partnership interests, loans, indebtedness, or any other forms of
securities (including options to acquire the foregoing and any securities
convertible or exchangeable into any of the foregoing) in the Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates, or any securities that derive 10% or more of their value
from securities in the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (all such property,
" _Prohibited Investments_ ") in circumstance to which subparagraph
88(1)(c)(vi) of the Canadian Tax Act applies; and

  

(b)  will not knowingly cause, direct, influence or consent to
any corporation in which the Seller or a Controlled Specified Shareholder is
a "specified shareholder" for the purpose of subparagraph 88(1)(c)(vi) of the
Canadian Tax Act owning, purchasing or acquiring, directly or indirectly, any
Prohibited Investments in circumstance to which subparagraph 88(1)(c)(vi) of
the Canadian Tax Act applies.

  

5.23   _Irish Servicing Agreement_. Following the Closing and until
such time as CITAI has no further obligations under the Irish Servicing
Agreement, Purchaser and/or its Affiliates shall cause any services required
to be performed by CITAI (i) to be performed by CITAI on the same terms and
conditions as apply on the date hereof, including with respect to compensation
currently received by Seller and its Affiliates, and (ii) to be performed
directly by employees of CITAI or by independent contractors engaged and
directed by employees of CITAI, in each case, in Ireland; provided, that the
Irish Servicing Agreement does not impose any restrictions on the ability of
Purchaser or its Affiliates to operate its business. At any time prior to the
Closing Date, Seller may, without the consent of Purchaser, terminate the
Irish Servicing Agreement or amend the Irish Servicing Agreement to
remove CITAI as a party thereto.

  

5.24   _Canadian Tax Matters_.

  

(a)  Purchaser shall, at Purchaser's expense, prepare and timely

the Tax Return for the first taxable period of the entity resulting from the
amalgamation, at step 12 of the Restructuring Plan, between Purchaser Sub and
CIT ULC (" _CanAmalCo_ "), which shall include (x) a designation under

of its member interests of CIT LLC by an amount equal to the maximum amount
permissible under the Canadian Tax Act and (y) an election under section 93 of
the Canadian Tax Act in respect of disposition by CanAmalCo of its CIT LLC
member interests containing an elected amount that is equal to the tax-free
surplus balance of CIT LLC, within the meaning of subsection 5905(5.5) of the
Income Tax Regulations (Canada), and (iii) a form filed by Purchaser Sub with
the Minister of National Revenue containing all information required by, and

solely of money.

  

(c)  From and after the date of this Agreement, and for a period
of 36 months following the Closing, Parent and its Affiliates (including
Purchaser Direct Parent, Purchaser, and CanAmalCo) will not knowingly
remarket, offer for sale, or transfer any property distributed to CanAmalCo
by CIT ULC on the amalgamation of CIT ULC and Purchaser Sub, for purposes of
subsection 88(1) of the Canadian Tax Act (including, without limitation, CIT
LLC member interests), or any property substituted for any such distributed
property (within the meaning of subsection 88(1) of the Canadian Tax Act),
other than any publicly traded security, to any person who was a shareholder
of CIT Group Inc. at any time in the period from 6 months preceding the

Article VI 
  
 EMPLOYEE MATTERS COVENANTS

  

6.1   _Treatment of Transferred Employees_.

  

(a)  Seller shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliates to,
subject to employee consent where required in any non-U.S.
jurisdiction, transfer the employment of each (i) Business Employee who is
not already employed by a member of the Commercial Air Group to a member of
the Commercial Air Group, effective no later than the Closing Date, and (ii)
employee who is not a Business Employee and who is otherwise employed by a
member of the Commercial Air Group from such member of the Commercial Air
Group to Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than a member of the
Commercial Air Group), as designated by Seller, prior to the Closing Date.
Any Business Employee who remains an employee of a member of the Commercial
Air Group as of the Closing, including an employee on approved leave of
absence, shall be referred to as a " _Transferred Employee_." Notwithstanding
any of the foregoing, with respect to any LTD Employee, Purchaser shall make
an offer of employment consistent with the requirements set forth in this
_Article VI_ , contingent on such LTD Employee's ability to return to
employment within six (6) months following the Closing Date or such longer
period as may be required by applicable law and when an LTD Employee has (i)
accepted the offer and (ii) returns to active status, such LTD Employee shall
be considered a Transferred Employee.

  

(b)  For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing
(the " _Continuation Period_ "), Purchaser shall provide, or shall cause to
be provided, to each Transferred Employee (i) base compensation (including
base salary or hourly rate of pay, as applicable) that is no less than that
provided to the Transferred Employee immediately before the Closing, (ii)
incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable than the
incentive compensation opportunities (paid in cash or equity-based), in the
aggregate, applicable to the Transferred Employee immediately before the
Closing (which for the avoidance of doubt, may

    

-68-

 



    

be paid by Purchaser in cash (with a market rate of return if subject to
mandatory deferral, vesting beyond the first quarter following the year to
which the incentive relates (in the case of short-term incentive) or vesting
over more than one year) if equity-based compensation is not otherwise awarded
to similarly situated employees of Purchaser), and (iii) benefits, including,
without limitation, healthcare and other welfare benefits (other than post-
retirement welfare benefits and retention benefits), vacation, leaves,
holidays, sick time, and personal time off, retirement (other than defined
benefit pension plan benefits), and other compensation programs that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to the
Transferred Employee immediately before the Closing. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser shall provide, or
shall cause to be provided, to each Transferred Employee who, during the
Continuation Period, is terminated or receives notice of termination,
including under any circumstances that would entitle such Transferred
Employee to severance under the terms of the severance arrangements set forth
on Section 6.1(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, severance benefits equal
to the severance benefits under such severance arrangements.

  

(c)  For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any
Transferred Employees after the Closing, including the Assumed Plans (the "
_New Plans_ "), each Transferred Employee shall be credited with his or her
years of service with Seller and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Closing, to the same extent as such Transferred
Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service under
any similar Benefit Plan in which such Transferred Employee participated or
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing, _provided_
 that (other than in the case of severance benefits or for purposes of any
Assumed Plan) the foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual
under any defined benefit pension plans or to the extent that its application
would result in a duplication of benefits or to the extent prior service is
not credited to similarly situated employees of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries
under such plans. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Purchaser shall (i) cause each New Plan to provide that each
Transferred Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan is comparable to a Benefit Plan in which such Transferred Employee
participated immediately before the Closing (such plans, collectively, the "
_Old Plans_ "), and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each
New Plan to provide that for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Transferred Employee,
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered
dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the
comparable Old Plan, and Purchaser shall cause any eligible expenses incurred
by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plans ending on the date such employee's participation in
the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan for the same plan year.

  

6.2   _WARN and Corresponding State Laws_. Seller shall be solely
responsible for and agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and, at the option of
Purchaser, to defend Purchaser and its Affiliates from and against any
Liability under WARN with respect to employee losses occurring on or prior to
the Closing Date solely as a result of Seller's actions or Seller's
failure to serve

    

-69-

 



    

sufficient notice pursuant to WARN. Purchaser shall assume and be solely
responsible for and agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and, at the option of
Seller, to defend Seller and its Affiliates from and against any Liability
under WARN with respect to employee losses occurring after the Closing Date as
a result of Purchaser's actions or Purchaser's failure to serve sufficient
notice pursuant to WARN (whether due to Purchaser's actions or
Purchaser's failure to serve sufficient notice pursuant to WARN (a) alone or
(b) in combination with Seller's actions or Seller's failure to serve
sufficient notice pursuant to WARN). Within five days following the Closing
Date, Seller shall provide Purchaser with a list of all employment losses
that have occurred in the 90 days preceding the Closing Date at each site of
employment where any Business Employee works. During the 90 days following
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide Seller with notice of all
employment losses that occur during such 90-day period (which notice shall be
delivered within five days following each such employment loss) at each site
where a Transferred Employee works following the Closing.

  

6.3   _Transfer of Assumed Plans; Retention and Transaction
Success Awards_.

  

(a)  At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall (or shall cause
its applicable Affiliates to) transfer any Assumed Plan (and
any corresponding Assets and Liabilities) that is not sponsored or maintained
by a member of the Commercial Air Group to a member of the Commercial Air
Group and, subject to _Section 6.3(b)_ , on and after the Closing, Purchaser
shall and shall cause the applicable members of the Commercial Air Group to
assume (and indemnify Seller and its Affiliates against) all Liabilities with
respect to the Assumed Plans (whether incurred prior to, on or after the
Closing Date). From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause
the Commercial Air Group to, honor all Assumed Plans in accordance with their
terms. Seller shall take all actions as are necessary so that effective as of
and contingent upon the Closing, no member of the Commercial Air Group is an
adopting employer with respect to any Benefit Plan that is not an Assumed
Plan.

  

(b)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser
shall or shall cause the applicable members of the Commercial Air Group to
pay all obligations under the Assumed Plans set forth on Section 6.3(b) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ ,  _however_ , within thirty (30) days
following Seller's receipt of notice from Purchaser that a "Retention
Award" or "Transaction Success Award" (as defined in the applicable Assumed
Plan, for the avoidance of doubt, including under the Knittel Employment
Agreement) has been paid by Purchaser or the applicable members of the
Commercial Air Group in accordance with the terms of the applicable Assumed
Plan (which notice shall include documentation evidencing such payment),
Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for the amount paid by Purchaser or the
applicable members of the Commercial Air Group and any related payroll Tax
obligations, less any related Tax deduction realized by Purchaser or the
applicable members of the Commercial Air Group. Any amounts deposited with an
escrow agent in respect of the Transaction Success Award payable under the
Knittel Employment Agreement shall not reduce the Adjusted Net Asset Amount.
For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have no
payment obligations whatsoever with respect to a Retention Award or
Transaction Success Award paid to any individual who is not a
Transferred Employee, and, other than with respect to the reimbursement of
Retention Awards and Transaction Success Awards contemplated by this _Section
6.3_ , Seller and its Affiliates shall have no Liabilities with respect to the
Assumed Plans (including with respect to severance obligations thereunder),
_provided_ that any obligations

    

-70-

 



    

(excluding severance obligations (other than the "Additional ERP Credit" as
defined under the Knittel Employment Agreement)) under the Knittel Employment
Agreement in respect of a Benefit Plan sponsored by Seller and its Affiliates
that is not an Assumed Plan shall remain a Liability of Seller and its
Affiliates.

  

6.4   _Unused Vacation, Sick Leave and Personal Time_. Purchaser
shall honor all unused accrued vacation, sick leave and other personal time
off of each Transferred Employee during the calendar year in which the Closing
Date occurs, to the extent an accrual for such Liability is reflected on the
Closing Adjusted Net Asset Statement. Thereafter, the Transferred Employees
shall be subject to, and commence to accrue benefits under, the vacation,
sick leave and other personal time off policies of Purchaser applicable to
the respective Transferred Employee, consistent with _Section 6.1_ of this
Agreement; _provided_ that, unless Purchaser's plan otherwise provides for
more generous carry over rules, the Transferred Employees shall be
entitled to carryover unused vacation, sick leave and other personal time off
to the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Closing Date
occurs to the same extent any such time would have been carried over under
Seller's policies (and, with respect to Transferred Employees based in the
United States, in all cases not to exceed a maximum of five carry-over days
unless otherwise required by applicable Law).

  

6.5   _Incentive Awards_.

  

(a)  From and following the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates
shall retain all Liabilities related to incentive compensation earned with
respect to periods prior to January 1, 2017 (including without limitation, the
deferred portion of incentives that have previously been awarded); _provided_
, _however_ , if Seller determines it is administratively impractical for
Seller and its Affiliates to pay any portion of such incentive compensation,
Seller may direct Purchaser to pay any unpaid amounts (i) in the case of cash
incentive compensation earned with respect to 2016 that is not deferred, to
the extent such amounts and any related payroll Tax obligations, less any
related Tax deduction realized by Purchaser or its Affiliates, are reflected
on the Closing Adjusted Net Asset Statement and (ii) in the case of all other
incentive compensation, to the extent Seller reimburses Purchaser for the
amount paid by Purchaser or its Affiliates and any related payroll Tax
obligations, less any related Tax deduction realized by Purchaser or its
Affiliates. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any amounts of
incentive compensation earned with respect to 2016 that would ordinarily be
paid in the form of equity-based awards may instead be paid in the form of
deferred cash awards.

  

(b)  Purchaser and its Affiliates shall assume all Liabilities
with respect to any annual incentive opportunity pursuant to any incentive or
bonus arrangement or practice covering Transferred Employees in respect of
2017, with such individual and aggregate awards determined in accordance with
the terms of the applicable incentive arrangement or practice applicable to
the Transferred Employee as in effect immediately prior to the Closing and
consistent with past practice; _provided_ that, Purchaser may pay any portion
of such incentive compensation that was customarily paid by the Seller Group
in equity-based awards in cash (with a market rate of return if subject to
mandatory deferral or vesting beyond the first quarter of 2018) if equity-
based compensation is not otherwise awarded to similarly situated employees
of Purchaser; _provided_ _further_ that the terms of any award that is
granted by Purchaser or its Affiliates in respect of an obligation assumed
hereunder shall be no less favorable (including

    

-71-

 



    

with respect to vesting schedule, which shall be solely time-based) than the
terms of any corresponding award that would have been granted by Seller or its
Affiliates.

  

6.6   _Employee Data_. Not less than two (2) Business Days prior
to the execution of this Agreement, Seller shall provide to Purchaser a
spreadsheet which accurately sets forth, as of the date thereof, and except as
limited or prohibited by applicable Law, the following information with
respect to each Business Employee: (i) employee identification number, job
title, reporting relationship and work location; (ii) date of hire; (iii)
whether employed on a full-time or part-time basis; (iv) current base salary
or hourly rate of compensation; (v) 2016 annual incentive opportunity and
annual incentive award paid for the 2015 performance year; and (vi) whether
such employee is on a short-term or temporary leave of absence, and in such
case, the expected return-to-work date if known, which spreadsheet shall be
updated, generally and to also include data on accrued vacation, sick leave
and paid time off and immigration status if employed in the U.S. and not a
U.S. citizen, by Seller five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

  

6.7   _Cooperation_. Following the Closing, Purchaser shall
provide Seller with such information as Seller reasonably requests regarding
the Transferred Employees in order for Seller to administer its post-Closing
obligations to Transferred Employees under the Benefit Plans, and Purchaser
shall notify Seller of the termination of each Transferred Employee's
employment with Purchaser and its Affiliates with ten (10) Business Days
following each such termination.

  

6.8   _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is solely
for the benefit of the Parties and is not intended to confer upon any other
Persons any rights or remedies hereunder. Except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in
any employee to employment with Purchaser, Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates, be treated as establishing or amending any employee benefit plan
or arrangement of Purchaser, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates, or
preclude Purchaser, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates from
amending, merging, modifying, terminating, eliminating, reducing, or
otherwise altering in any respect any employee benefit plan or arrangement,
including any Benefit Plan or Assumed Plan, any benefit thereunder or any
trust, insurance policy or funding vehicle related to any of the foregoing.

information already in the possession of the members of the Commercial Air
Group or Purchaser reasonably requested by Seller to facilitate the
preparation and filing of any Tax Returns described in this _Section
7.3(a)_, and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare
(or cause to be prepared) such information in a manner and on a timeline
requested by Seller, which information and timeline shall be consistent with
the past practice of the relevant member of the Commercial Air Group.

  

(b)  Except for any Tax Return required to be prepared by Seller
pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ , Purchaser shall prepare and timely file or
cause to be prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns with respect to the
members of the Commercial Air Group. In the case of any such Tax Return for a

consistent with past practices of the relevant member of the Commercial Air
Group except as may be otherwise required by Law. Purchaser shall deliver to

or election relating thereto) without the prior written consent of Seller
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Agreement, Seller shall not be required to provide any Person with any Tax
Return or copy of any Tax Return of (i) any member of the Seller Group or (ii)

Returns reasonably requested by any Person in connection with the preparation
of any Tax Return, any Tax audit or examination in connection with an
administrative or judicial proceeding involving a Tax authority relating to
Taxes.

  

7.4   _Certain Tax Benefits_.

  

(a)  If Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing Date, the members of the Commercial Air Group) actually realizes a
Tax Benefit as a result of any audit adjustment (or adjustment in any other
Tax Proceeding) made with respect to any Tax Item by any taxing authority
with respect to Taxes for which Seller is responsible under _Section 7.1_ ,
then Purchaser shall, or shall cause the appropriate Affiliate to, use its
reasonable best efforts to claim such Tax Benefit and, to the extent such Tax
Benefit is actually realized in the year that such audit adjustment (or
adjustment in any other Tax Proceeding) becomes final (or in a prior year or

    

-74-

 



    

either of the two (2) succeeding years), pay to Seller the amount of such Tax
Benefit within fifteen (15) days of filing the Tax Return in which such Tax
Benefit is actually realized.

  

(b)  Seller shall be entitled to any Tax Benefit arising from
any Tax Item arising in respect of any payment, loss, obligation, liability
or Tax that Seller or any of its respective Affiliates are responsible for
under this Agreement or otherwise, and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that
neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing
Date, the members of the Commercial Air Group) shall claim any such Tax Item
on any Tax Return for a Post-Closing Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
any such Tax Item is not permitted by applicable Law to be claimed on a Tax
Return for which Seller has filing responsibility pursuant to _Section
7.3(a)_ and is permitted by applicable Law to be claimed on a Tax Return for
which Purchaser has filing responsibility pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_ , then
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to claim such Tax Item
and pay to Seller the amount of any Tax Benefit actually realized as a result
of claiming such Tax Item on such Tax Return.

  

(c)  Seller shall be entitled to (i) any refunds or credits of
or against any Taxes for which Seller is responsible and has paid under
_Section 7.1_ and (ii) any refunds or credits to which Seller is
entitled under _Section 7.4(a)_ or _Section 7.4(b)_. Purchaser shall be
entitled to any refunds or credits of any member of the Commercial Air Group
of or against any Taxes other than refunds or credits to which Seller is
entitled pursuant to the foregoing sentence. Each Party shall pay, or cause
its Affiliates to pay, to the Party entitled to a refund or credit of
Taxes under this _Section 7.4_ , the amount of such refund or credit
(including any interest paid thereon and net of any Taxes to the Party
receiving such refund or credit in respect of the receipt or accrual of such
refund or credit) in readily available funds within fifteen (15) days of the
actual receipt of the refund or credit or the application of such refund or
credit against amounts otherwise payable.

  

7.5   _Tax Contests_.

  

(a)  If any taxing authority asserts a Tax Claim, then the Party
to this Agreement first receiving notice of such Tax Claim promptly shall
provide written notice thereof to the other Party or Parties to this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of such Party to give
such prompt notice shall not relieve the other Party of any of its obligations
under this _Article VII_ , except to the extent that the other Party is
prejudiced by such failure. Such notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the basis for such Tax Claim and shall include a copy of the relevant
portion of any correspondence received from the taxing authority.

  

(b)  In the case of a Tax Proceeding of or with respect to any
member of the Commercial Air Group involving a Tax Claim (other than a Tax
Proceeding described in _Section 7.5(c)_ with respect to which Seller has not
made an election pursuant to the second sentence in _Section 7.5(c)_ ),
Purchaser shall have the right and obligation to conduct, at its own expense,
such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Tax Proceeding
could be expected to give rise to a claim for indemnity against Seller (i)
Purchaser shall provide Seller with a timely and reasonably detailed account
of each stage of such Tax Proceeding, (ii) Purchaser shall consult with
Seller before taking any significant action in connection with such Tax
Proceeding, (iii) Purchaser shall consult with Seller and offer Seller an
opportunity to comment before

    

-75-

 



    

submitting any written materials prepared or furnished in connection with
such Tax Proceeding, (iv) Purchaser shall defend such Tax Proceeding
diligently and in good faith as if it were the only Party in interest in
connection with such Tax Proceeding, (v) Seller shall be entitled to
participate in such Tax Proceeding and attend any meetings or conferences

withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Seller shall have the exclusive right to control in all respects any Tax
Proceeding with respect to (i) any Tax Return of any member of the Seller
Group, (ii) any Tax Return of a consolidated, combined or unitary group that
includes any member of the Seller Group (or any Combined Tax Return) or (iii)
any Taxes for which Seller is fully or partially responsible under _Section
7.1_ including any Shared Restructuring Taxes). Upon written notice to
Purchaser, Seller may elect to have Purchaser conduct any Tax Proceeding that
Seller would otherwise be entitled to control under this _Section 7.5(c)_. In
the event that Seller elects to have Purchaser conduct a Tax Proceeding
pursuant to the preceding sentence of this _Section 7.5(c)_ , Purchaser shall
conduct such Tax Proceeding and the provisions of _Section 7.5(b)_  shall
apply with respect to such Tax Proceeding.

refund, (ii) determining a liability for Taxes or an indemnity obligation
under this _Article VII_ or a right to refund of Taxes, or (iii) conducting
any Tax Proceeding, in each case relating to any Tax that the other party
could be expected to be responsible for under this Agreement. Such
cooperation and information shall include providing necessary powers of
attorney, copies of all relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns, together
with all relevant portions of relevant accompanying schedules and relevant
work papers, relevant documents relating to rulings or other determinations by
taxing authorities and relevant records concerning the ownership and Tax

convenient basis at its cost to provide an explanation of any documents or
information so provided.

  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
each Party shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, and all
material records and other documents relating to Tax matters, of the relevant
entities for their respective Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date until six months after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (taking into account extensions). Thereafter, the Party holding
such Tax Returns or other documents may dispose of them after offering the
other Party reasonable notice and opportunity to take possession of such Tax
Returns and other documents at such other Party's own expense.

  

(c)  Within three (3) months of the Closing, Seller will make
reasonable efforts to determine (A) the adjusted cost base to CIT Holdings

before the Closing Date, all Tax sharing agreements, Tax indemnity or similar
arrangements (other than this Agreement), if any, to which any member of the
Commercial Air Group, on the one hand, and any member of the Seller Group, on
the other hand, are Parties, and neither Seller nor any of its respective
Affiliates nor any member of the Commercial Air Group shall have any rights
or obligations thereunder after the Closing.

required pursuant to a "determination" (within the meaning of Section 1313(a)

Air Group (including any election pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
301.7701-3), which election would be effective or have effect on or prior to
the Closing Date without the prior consent of the Seller (such consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

7.10   _Dutch Tax Ruling; Restructuring_. After the date hereof,
Seller and its Affiliates, in consultation with Purchaser (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, consultation in respect of all submissions and discussions
with the applicable taxing authority in the Netherlands in respect of the
Dutch Tax Ruling (as defined below) and any related matters), shall use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain a written Tax ruling from the applicable
taxing authority in the Netherlands to the effect that (i) the existing share
premium of Dutch BV can be converted into share capital of Dutch BV and (ii)
after such conversion , the share capital of Dutch BV (including the
converted share premium) when distributed as contemplated by step 11(b) of the
Restructuring Plan will not be subject to withholding tax by the Netherlands
(the rulings contemplated by the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the "
_Dutch Tax Ruling_ "). In the event that Seller is unable to obtain the Dutch
Tax Ruling prior to Closing, absent mutual agreement to the contrary, the
Parties agree that (i) the distribution contemplated by step 11(b) of the
Restructuring Plan shall not be made, (ii) the proceeds from the sale of CIT
ULC in step 11(a) of the Restructuring Plan shall remain at Dutch BV, (iii)
the C2 Shares Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount of the Canadian

under applicable Law for filing the Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer
Taxes

    

-77-

 



    

shall prepare and timely file such Tax Returns and promptly provide a copy of
such Tax Return to the other Party. Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate to timely prepare and file
any Tax Returns or other filings relating to such Transfer Taxes, including
any claim for exemption or exclusion from the application or imposition of
any Transfer Taxes, and shall reasonably cooperate to lawfully minimize any
Transfer Taxes.

  

7.12   _Timing of Payments_. Any indemnity payment required to be
made pursuant to this _Article VII_ shall be made within ten (10) days after

warranties set forth in _Section 3.13_ and _Section 5.24_ , the covenant

9.1(b)(ii)(x)_ if the applicable Governmental Entity is a Chinese entity or
the applicable Law or Order relates to any of the regulatory approvals set
forth in _Section 8.1(b)_ or (B) _Section 9.1(b)(ii)(y)_ (other than with
respect to approvals required for the satisfaction of the condition set forth
in _Section 8.1(a)_ ).

  

(each of (i) through (vi), a " _Specified Termination_ ") then (a) in each
case of (i) through (vi), Purchaser shall instruct the Escrow Agent pursuant
to and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, to pay to Seller
within two (2) Business Days of termination, to an account designated by
Seller under the Escrow Agreement, in immediately available funds, (x) the
Escrow Amount of $600,000,000, or (y) if such Specified Termination occurs
prior to the Restructuring Phase I Completion Date, $500,000,000) (subclauses

case of a Specified Termination pursuant to (iv),

    

-82-

 



    

Purchaser shall also pay any shortfall between the Reverse Termination Fee
and the amount that has been deposited with the Escrow Agent, within two (2)
Business Days of such termination.

  

(b)  Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this _Section 9.4_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the other Party would not
enter into this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge that the Reverse
Termination Fee shall not constitute a penalty but is liquidated damages, in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Seller in the circumstances in which
the Reverse Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Sale, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.
The Parties acknowledge that the right of Seller to receive the Reverse
Termination Fee shall not limit or otherwise affect the Seller's right to
specific performance as provided in _Section 11.13_ or the Parties'
respective rights as set forth in _Section 9.3_. In no event, however, shall
the Seller be entitled to receive both effective specific performance actually
resulting in the Closing and the Reverse Termination Fee.

  

(c)  In any circumstance in which the Seller effects a Specified
Termination and receives the Reverse Termination Fee in full pursuant to
_Section 9.4(a)_ , except for the Seller Reimbursable Expenses and as provided
in _Section 9.5(a)_ , Seller's termination of this Agreement and receipt of
the Reverse Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller
and its Affiliates against Purchaser, the Guarantor under the Guaranty, the
parties to the Debt Commitment Letters, the other Debt Financing Sources and
any of their respective, direct or indirect, former, current or future general
or limited partners, managers, officers, directors, employees,
representatives, agents, successors and assigns (" _Purchaser Related Parties_
") for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Guaranty or the Debt Commitment
Letters, and upon such Specified Termination and receipt of the
Reverse Termination Fee, none of the Purchaser Related Parties shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
the transactions contemplated hereby, the Guaranty, the Debt Commitment
Letters, the Debt Financing or any Alternative Financing (except that the
applicable Purchaser Related Parties shall remain obligated for, and Purchaser
and its Subsidiaries may be entitled to remedies with respect to, any breach
of the Confidentiality Agreement, whether in equity or at law, in
contract, in tort or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
_Section 9.4(c)_ shall limit any remedies of Seller for specific performance
under _Section 11.13_.

  

9.5   _Release and Payment of Funds Upon Termination_.

  

(a)  In the event of a Specified Termination, if Purchaser fails
to pay (or cause to be paid) the amounts due to Seller pursuant to _Section
9.4_ , including by failing to deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement providing for the
release of the Escrow Amount to Seller, and in order to obtain such funds
Seller commences an action or proceeding in which it prevails, Purchaser
shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller (A) all fees and expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) of Seller and its Affiliates arising out
of or relating to such action or proceeding and (B) interest from the date
such payment was required to be made, at the Interest Rate, on such payment.

    

-83-

 



    

(b)  In the event of a termination of this Agreement that is not
a Specified Termination, if Seller fails to deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement providing for the release of the Escrow Amount to Purchaser, and in
order to obtain such funds Purchaser commences an action or proceeding in
which it prevails, Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Purchaser (A)
all fees and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of
Purchaser and its Affiliates arising out of or relating to such action or
proceeding and (B) interest from the date such payment was required to be
made, at the Interest Rate, on the Escrow Amount, less any interest or other
income earned on the Escrow Amount pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

  

9.6   _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing,
either Seller or Purchaser may (a) extend the time for performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties of the other Party contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement (including
the Canadian Purchase Agreement) or (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions of the other Party contained in this Agreement.
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the Party granting such extension or waiver.

10.4   _Indemnification Procedures_.

  

(a)  A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this
Agreement (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the Party
liable for such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), in writing of
any pending or threatened claim or demand that the Indemnified Party has
determined has given or would reasonably be expected to give rise to a right
of indemnification under such agreement (including a pending or threatened
claim or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnifying Party,
such claim being a " _Third Party Claim_ "), describing in reasonable detail
the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim
or demand; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice
shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under
this _Article X_ , except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually
and materially prejudiced by such failure, it being agreed that notices for
claims in respect of a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement describe in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances (to the
extent known or reasonably ascertainable) with respect to the alleged breach
and be delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable survival period
specified in _Section 10.1_ for such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, as applicable.

  

(b)  Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim for
indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_  or
_Section 10.3(a)_ , the Indemnifying Party will be entitled, by notice to the
Indemnified Party delivered within thirty (30) Business Days of the receipt
of notice of such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense and control of such
Third Party Claim (at the expense of such Indemnifying Party); _provided_
that the Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified Party a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third Party
Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party
does not assume the defense and control of any Third Party Claim pursuant to
this _Section 10.4(b)_ , the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume
and control such defense, but the Indemnifying Party may nonetheless
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and
at its own expense, _provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnifying Party may
not assume the defense of such Third Party Claim if such Third Party Claim has
a reasonable likelihood of resulting in monetary damages that would
substantially exceed the Cap pursuant to this _Article X_. Purchaser or
Seller, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates
and representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in
the defense of any Third Party Claim, including by furnishing books and
records, information, personnel and witnesses, as appropriate for any defense
of such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense
and control of a Third Party Claim, it shall be authorized to consent to a
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party
Claim, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any Indemnified
Party; _provided_ that (i) such settlement or judgment does not involve (x)
claims related to the second proviso of the first sentence of this _Section
10.4(b)_ or (y) any injunctive relief binding on any of the Indemnified
Parties or finding or admission of any violation of Law or admission of any
wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall pay or
cause to be paid all amounts in such settlement or judgment

    

-87-

 



    

(whether or not such Losses exceed the Deductible) and (iii) the Indemnifying
Party shall obtain, as a condition of any settlement or other resolution, a
complete and unconditional release of any Indemnified Party potentially
affected by such Third Party Claim. No Indemnified Party will consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with respect
to a Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party.

  

10.5   _Exclusive Remedy and Release_. Except with respect to (i) the
matters covered by _Section 2.4_ through _Section 2.7_ , (ii) any matter
relating to Taxes, (iii) matters for which specific performance or other
equitable remedies are available pursuant to _Section 11.13_ or (iv) fraud,
Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and agree that, following the Closing, the
indemnification provisions of _Sections 10.2_ and _10.3_ shall be the sole
and exclusive remedies of Seller and Purchaser, respectively, and their
respective Affiliates, including the members of the Commercial Air Group, for
any Losses (including any Losses from claims for breach of contract,
warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and whether
predicated on common law, statute, strict liability, or otherwise) that each
Party may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of,
or in connection with the Sale or the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including any breach of any representation or warranty in this Agreement or
the Canadian Purchase Agreement by any Party, or any failure by any Party to
perform or comply with any covenant or agreement that, by its terms, was to
have been performed, or complied with, under this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements.

  

10.6   _Additional Indemnification Provisions_. With respect to each
indemnification obligation contained in this _Article X_ , all Losses shall
be net of any third-party insurance and indemnity proceeds that are actually
recovered by the Indemnified Party in connection with the facts giving rise
to the right of indemnification, net of the costs of recovery, of such third-
party insurance or indemnity proceeds (it being agreed that if third-party
insurance or indemnification proceeds in respect of such facts are recovered
by the Indemnified Party subsequent to the Indemnifying Party's making of an
indemnification payment in satisfaction of its applicable indemnification
obligation, such proceeds shall be promptly remitted to the Indemnifying Party
to the extent of the indemnification payment made). Any indemnification
payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be reduced by the amount of any
net Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party through a reduction
in Taxes otherwise due as a result of the damages incurred or suffered by the
Indemnified Party, calculated by computing the amount of Taxes of the
Indemnified Party before and after inclusion of any Tax deductions
attributable to such damages (treating such Tax deductions as the last items
claimed). The Indemnified Party shall use, and cause its Affiliates to use,
commercially reasonable efforts to seek full recovery under all insurance
policies and indemnity provisions covering any Losses for which it is seeking
indemnification hereunder, to the same extent as it would if such Loss were
not subject to indemnification hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, except
with respect to the second sentence of _Section 3.6_ , any inaccuracy in or
breach of any provision in _Article III_ and _Article IV_ and any Losses
incurred as a result thereof shall be determined without regard to any
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other similar qualification contained
in and otherwise applicable to such provision for purposes of determining
indemnification obligations and Losses contained in this _Article X_. Upon
making any payment to the Indemnified Party for any indemnification claim
pursuant to this _Article X_ , the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to
the extent of such payment and to the extent permitted by Law, to any rights
which the Indemnified Party may have

    

-88-

 



    

against any third parties with respect to the subject matter underlying such
indemnification claim, and the Indemnified Party shall assign any such rights
to the Indemnifying Party.

  

10.7   _Limitation of Liability_. In no event shall any Indemnifying
Party have liability to any Indemnified Party for any (a) special, exemplary,
punitive, or similar damages or (b) any indirect damages that are not
reasonably foreseeable other than in each case such damages with respect to
Third Party Claims to the extent such damages are paid. No Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to recover from an Indemnifying Party more than once in
respect of Losses resulting from a single or series of related claims. Any
Liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of state of facts giving rise to such
Liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement.

  

10.8   _Mitigation_. To the fullest extent required by applicable
Law, each of the Parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate its respective Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or
condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that
are indemnifiable hereunder.

language. The Parties agree that (A) the claimant(s) and respondent(s) shall
each appoint one arbitrator within twenty (20) days of the date of delivery of
the notice of arbitration; and (B) the two party-appointed arbitrators shall
appoint the third arbitrator, who shall serve as the chair of the Tribunal,
within twenty (20) days from the date of the appointment of the second
arbitrator. Each member of the Tribunal must be a former judge of the
Delaware Supreme Court and/or Delaware Court of Chancery; _provided_ , that
in the event a former Delaware judge is unavailable to serve as arbitrator
for one or more

    

-91-

 



    

of the positions on the Tribunal, then the Parties shall submit a petition
for the appointment of one or more arbitrators (as needed to complete the
three-member Tribunal) to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
under Section 5805 of the DRAA. Any arbitrator not timely appointed as
provided in clause (A) or (B) of this _Section 11.3(c)(i)_ shall be appointed
by the Delaware Court of Chancery in accordance with Section 5805 of the
DRAA. In the event that the Tribunal retains counsel in consultation with the
parties hereto under Section 5806 of the DRAA, then such counsel shall be
impartial and shall be knowledgeable about and experienced with the practice
of law and have had at least fifteen (15) years of legal experience in the
area of mergers and acquisitions or complex commercial transactions. Only
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall have the power and
authority to appoint a new arbitrator in the event any arbitrator becomes
unable to continue as arbitrator for any reason.

  

(ii)  The arbitration shall be deemed commenced when the
claimant(s) deliver a notice of arbitration to all of the respondents in the
manner provided for notices in _Section 11.9_. The Parties agree that the
preliminary conference shall be no later than ten (10) days after the
constitution of the Tribunal. The Parties agree that any service or written
communication (including, the answer, any reply or exchange of information)
under the DRAA or the Rules shall be made in a manner provided by
_Section 11.9_ of this Agreement, or as otherwise agreed by the Parties. In
connection with any arbitration proceeding hereunder, the Tribunal shall
allow reasonable requests for the production of documents relevant to the
dispute and permit the taking of depositions limited to not more than five
(5) persons on each side and for not more than six (6) hours in total for the
deposition of each such person. Where reasonably necessary, depositions may
be taken by videoconference or other telephonic means, or in the
jurisdiction where a witness resides or regularly transacts business. The
Tribunal may seek to compel the production of evidence from non-parties to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. The arbitration hearing shall
be limited to one (1) day, if the Tribunal deems such limitation appropriate,
and _provided_ that the Tribunal, where it considers it appropriate in order
to provide any party with a full and fair opportunity to be heard, may
require a hearing be held over the course of more than one day, and shall
be conducted as soon as reasonably practicable after the constitution of the
Tribunal, as determined by the Tribunal.

  

(iii)  For the purposes of DRAA § 5808(b), and all other purposes,
the Tribunal shall issue its final award as promptly as practicable, taking
into account the nature of the claims and any other facts or circumstances the
Tribunal deems relevant, but in no event later than ninety (90) calendar days
after the close of the arbitration hearing. The Parties agree that the
Tribunal may extend any deadline set forth in _Section 11.3(c)(ii)_ and this
_Section 11.3(c)(iii)_ if, in its own discretion, more time is needed in
light of the nature of the claims and the relevant facts and circumstances.
The Tribunal is authorized to award monetary damages and to grant specific
performance of this Agreement and other injunctive relief, including interim
relief pending the final award. The Parties hereto shall bear their own costs
incurred in connection with the arbitration and share equally the fees and
expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of administration.

  

(iv)  The Parties agree that any arbitral panel constituted under
the DRAA to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the Canadian
Purchase

    

-92-

 



    

Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Guaranty shall also have jurisdiction
over each Party hereto, and may also resolve disputes arising under or
relating to this Agreement. The Parties intend that the rights of all parties
relating to the enforcement of this Agreement, the Canadian Purchase
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Guaranty shall be determined as
quickly as possible, and no Party shall object to being named as a party to
such a proceeding to resolve any Dispute. The Parties further consent and
agree that any arbitral panel constituted under the DRAA to resolve a dispute
arising under or relating to the Canadian Purchase Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or the Guaranty shall also have jurisdiction over each Party
hereto, and may also resolve Disputes. The Parties further agree that in the
event an arbitral proceeding under this _Section 11.3(c)_ has been commenced,
any dispute arising under or relating to the Canadian Purchase Agreement the
Escrow Agreement or the Guaranty thereafter arising shall be consolidated with
and into the arbitral proceeding already commenced hereunder; and that in the
event an arbitral proceeding has been commenced as provided in the Canadian
Purchase Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Guaranty, any Dispute
thereafter arising shall be consolidated with and into the arbitral
proceeding already commenced as provided in the Canadian Purchase Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement or the Guaranty, such that all disputes arising under
this _Section 11.3(c)_ , the Canadian Purchase Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
or the Guaranty shall proceed in one consolidated arbitration; _provided,
however_ , an arbitral tribunal constituted under this _Section 11.3(c)_
or the Canadian Purchase Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Guaranty
shall, prior to consolidation of the arbitration proceeding, and after
providing all interested parties the opportunity to comment on such
consolidation, have the authority to order that consolidation shall not occur
if it determines that (i) there are no common questions of law or fact in the
arbitrations to be consolidated; (ii) the proceedings in the arbitration
before it would be improperly delayed or disrupted, or a party would otherwise
suffer undue prejudice, by consolidation; or (iii) consolidation would not be
more efficient than separate arbitral proceedings. In order to give effect to
consolidation as provided herein, the arbitral tribunal constituted under this
_Section 11.3(c)_ or the Canadian Purchase Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or
the Guaranty shall have the authority to extend its deadline to hold a
preliminary conference or render a final award as provided in _Section
11.3(c)(ii)_ and _Section 11.3(c)(iii)_ , respectively. For the avoidance of
doubt, the presumption shall be in favor of consolidation of all proceedings
arising under this Agreement, the Canadian Purchase Agreement the Escrow
Agreement or the Guaranty.

  

(v)  Nothing in this _Section 11.3(c)_ shall prevent a Party
from seeking provisional, interim or conservatory measures in aid of
arbitration from the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware at any time if
any such Party believes in good faith that it will suffer irreparable injury
before the Tribunal has been appointed or before the Tribunal has had time to
render a final award. Any such request by a Party to the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware for provisional, interim or conservatory measures shall
not be deemed incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate in this _Section
11.3(c)_ , the DRAA or a waiver of the right to arbitrate.

  

(vi)  The arbitral award shall be final and non-appealable and not
subject to challenge. Judgment upon the arbitral award may be entered by the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the Superior Court of the State
of Delaware in

    

-93-

 



    

accordance with the DRAA, and enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction. The Parties hereby agree to waive any claim that this agreement
to arbitrate is not valid under the Laws of the U.S., any foreign country or
any international agreement.

  

(vii)  For the avoidance of doubt, and in furtherance of _Section
11.3(a)_ of this Agreement, the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that any
legal proceeding conducted under this _Section 11.3(c)_ shall be governed by
or construed under the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to
principles of conflict of laws and regardless of whether the laws of the State
of Delaware govern the Parties' other rights, remedies, liabilities, powers
and duties.

  

11.4   _Sovereign Immunity_.

  

(a)  With respect to the liability and obligations of Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates, with respect to themselves, their affiliates or
their property, Purchaser:

  

(i)  agrees that, for the purposes of the doctrine of
sovereign immunity, the execution, delivery and performance by it of
this Agreement constitutes private and commercial acts done for private and
commercial purposes;

  

(ii)  agrees that, should any proceedings be brought against it,
any of its Affiliates or any of its or its Affiliates' assets in any
jurisdiction in relation to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, Purchaser shall not be entitled to any immunity on the
basis of sovereignty in respect of its obligations under this Agreement, and
no immunity from such proceedings (including, without limitation, immunity
from service of process from suit, from the jurisdiction of any court,
from an order or injunction of such court or the enforcement of same against
its assets) shall be claimed by or on behalf of Purchaser or with respect to
its assets;

  

(iii)  waives, in any such proceedings, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any right of immunity which it, its Affiliates or any of
its assets now has or may acquire in the future in any jurisdiction, and
agrees to expressly make such waiver at the time of any such proceedings;

  

(iv)  consents generally in respect of the enforcement of any
judgment or award against it or its Affiliates in any such proceedings to the
giving of any relief or the issue of any process in any jurisdiction in
connection with such proceedings (including, without limitation, pre-judgment
attachment, post judgment attachment, the making, enforcement or execution
against or in respect of any assets whatsoever irrespective of their use or
intended use of any order or judgment that may be made or given in connection
therewith); and

  

(v)  specifies that, for the purposes of this provision,
"assets" shall be taken as excluding "premises of the mission" as defined in
the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations signed at Vienna, April 18,
1961, "consular premises" as defined in the Vienna Convention on Consular
Relations signed in 1963, and military property or military assets or
property of Purchaser or Guarantor or of any country.

11.5   _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the
Ancillary Agreements and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and thereto and
the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the

is not intended to confer in or on behalf of any Person not a party to

causes of action or remedies with respect to the subject matter or any
provision hereof; provided that each of Seller and Purchaser may enforce any
applicable indemnity or payment or reimbursement obligation set forth in this
Agreement on behalf of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each

11.3(b)(ii)_ (Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Forum; Waiver of Jury
Trial; Arbitration), the last sentence of this _Section 11.6_ (No Third Party
Beneficiaries) and the last sentence of _Section 11.11_ (Amendments and
Waivers) and _Section 11.16_ (Non-Recourse).

Agreement, Seller and Purchaser will (i) use their respective reasonable best

so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby on or
before the Outside Date, to the extent reasonably possible, and each will
cooperate fully with, and furnish information to, the other party to that end
and (ii) not take, and shall cause their Affiliates not to take, any action
that is intended to or which would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay or impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated
herein

  

11.8   _Expenses_. Except as set forth in this Agreement, whether the

11.10   _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Parties to this Agreement and their
respective successors and assigns. No Party to this Agreement may directly or
indirectly assign any or all of its rights or delegate any or all of its
obligations under this Agreement without the express prior written consent of
each other Party to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , Purchaser may
assign any or all of its rights (but not obligations) under this Agreement to
any of its Affiliates (so long as they remain Affiliates) and may collaterally
assign any or all of its rights (but not obligations) under this Agreement to
any of the Debt Financing Sources in connection with the Debt Financing, in
each case, without the prior written consent of Seller.

  

11.11   _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be modified or
amended except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by the Party
against whom enforcement of any such modification or amendment is sought.
Either Party to this Agreement may, only by an instrument in writing, waive
compliance by the other Party to this Agreement with any term or provision of
this Agreement on the part of such other Party to this Agreement to be
performed or complied with. The waiver by any Party to this Agreement of a
breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a
waiver of any subsequent breach. In the event that any party seeks an
amendment to or waiver of _Section_ _11.3(b)(ii)_ (Governing Law; Jurisdiction
and Forum; Waiver of Jury Trial; Arbitration), the last sentence of _Section
11.6_ (No Third Party Beneficiaries) and the last sentence of this  _Section
11.11_ (Amendments and Waivers) and _Section 11.16_ (Non-Recourse) that
directly relates to and is materially adverse to the Debt Financing Sources,
the prior written consent of each of the Debt Financing Sources shall be
required before any such amendment or waiver may become effective.

  

11.12   _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party
hereto. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties
as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

  

11.13   _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform any
provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled in Law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has an adequate

    

-97-

 



    

remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with such order or injunction. The
foregoing is in addition to any other remedy to which any Party is entitled
at law, in equity or otherwise. The Parties further agree that nothing set
forth in this _Section 11.13_ shall require any Party to institute any Action
for (or limit any Party's right to institute any Action for) specific
performance under this _Section 11.13_ prior or as a condition to exercising
any termination right under _Article IX_ (and pursuing damages after such
termination). The Parties agree that, notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Seller shall be entitled to specific performance (or any other
equitable relief) to cause Purchaser to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including to draw down the Debt Financing under the Debt
Commitment Letter (including any bridge financing or "flex" provisions
thereunder) or Alternative Financing commitments obtained under _Section 5.13_
, and to effect the Closing on the terms and subject to the conditions in
this Agreement, only if: (i) if the Marketing Period has expired and all
conditions in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_ have been satisfied as of the
date on which the Closing would otherwise be required to occur (other than
those conditions that, by their nature, can only be satisfied at the Closing (
_provided_ that such conditions would have been satisfied as of such date)),
(ii) Purchaser fails to complete the Closing by the date the Closing would
otherwise be required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.3_ , (iii) the
Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing in accordance with _Section 5.13_ )
has been funded, or is available to be funded to Purchaser at the Closing, and
(iv) the Seller has irrevocably confirmed to Purchaser in writing that if the
Debt Financing is funded, and Purchaser otherwise complies with its
obligations hereunder, then the Seller is ready, willing and able to
consummate the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.3_. For the avoidance of
doubt, while Seller and Purchaser may pursue both a grant of specific
performance as, and only to the extent, expressly permitted pursuant to this
_Section 11.13_ , and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, in no event
shall Seller be entitled to receive both effective specific performance
actually resulting in the Closing and the Reverse Termination Fee.

  

11.14   _No Admission_. Nothing herein shall be deemed an admission by
Seller or any of its respective Affiliates, in any Action or proceeding
involving a third party, that Seller or any of its respective Affiliates or
any such third party is or is not in breach or violation of, or in default
in, the performance or observance of any term or provisions of any contract.

  

11.15   _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the respective Parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile shall be as
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

  

11.16   _Non-Recourse_. Each Party agrees that all claims or causes of
action (whether based on contract, equity, tort or any other theory) that may
be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation
execution or performance of this Agreement may be made only against persons
who are Parties to this Agreement (including for the avoidance of doubt,
Purchaser Direct Parent, Seller Parent, and, with respect to claims arising
out of or relating to _Section 5.16_ or _Section 5.18_ , Parent) or parties
to the Guaranty. No Person who is not a named

    

-98-

 



    

party to this Agreement or the Guaranty shall have any liability (whether
based on contract, equity, tort or any other theory that seeks to impose
liability of an entity party against its owners, representatives, agents or
Affiliates for any obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection
with or related to or its negotiation or execution. The Parties waive and
release all such liabilities, claims and obligations against any Person who
is not a named party to this Agreement or the Guaranty; provided that nothing
in this _Section 11.16_ shall affect the rights of any party hereto under the
Ancillary Agreements which shall remain subject to the terms thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Seller agrees,
on behalf of itself, its Subsidiaries and the Commercial Air Group, that
none of the Debt Financing Sources shall have any liability or obligation to
the Seller, any of its Subsidiaries or the Commercial Air Group relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein (including the
Debt Financing or any Alternative Financing). This _Section 11.16_ is
intended to benefit and may be enforced by the Debt Financing Sources and
shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Seller, its
Subsidiaries and the Commercial Air Group.

  

11.17   _Purchaser Direct Parent Guarantee_.

  

(a)  The Purchaser Direct Parent, as primary obligor and not
merely as surety, hereby absolutely, unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees the full and timely payment and performance of all
Liabilities (including indemnities, fees and Liabilities in respect of
equitable relief) of Purchaser incurred under, arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented in accordance with their terms (such
Liabilities, the " _Purchaser Direct Parent Guaranteed Obligations_ "). This
is a guarantee of payment and performance, and not of collectability.
The obligations of the Purchaser Direct Parent under this _Section 11.17_ are
absolute and unconditional in respect of satisfying the Purchaser Direct
Parent Guaranteed Obligations and shall be enforceable against the Purchaser
Direct Parent to the same extent as if the Purchaser Direct Parent were the
primary obligor (and not merely a surety) under this Agreement and the other
Ancillary Agreements.

  

(b)  The Purchaser Direct Parent hereby waives as to itself
promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of this guarantee and of the
Purchaser Direct Parent Guaranteed Obligations, presentment, demand for
payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of
any Purchaser Direct Parent Guaranteed Obligations incurred, all defenses
which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium Law or
other similar Law now or hereafter in effect, and all suretyship defenses
(it being understood that nothing in this sentence shall be deemed a waiver
by the Purchaser Direct Parent of the obligation of any other Party to
deliver notice pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements). The Purchaser Direct Parent agrees that the Purchaser Direct
Parent Guaranteed Obligations shall not be discharged except by complete
performance or payment of the amounts payable under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement, as applicable, and that the obligations of the
Purchaser Direct Parent hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in
whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure or delay on the
part of Seller to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy
against Purchaser; (ii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of
any of the Purchaser Direct Parent Guaranteed Obligations or any waiver,
compromise, consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of the
terms or provisions of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement made in
accordance with the terms thereof or any agreement evidencing, securing or
otherwise executed in connection with

    

-99-

 



    

any of the Purchaser Direct Parent Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) any change
in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of the Purchaser Direct
Parent, Purchaser or any other Person interested in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; or (iv) the
adequacy of any other means Seller may have of obtaining payment related to
any of the Purchaser Direct Parent Guaranteed Obligations, including pursuant
to the Guaranty. If at any time payment under the Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned by Seller
for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, on account of a
judicial, arbitral or administrative order relating to the Purchaser or
Purchaser Direct Parent, the Purchaser Direct Parent's obligations hereunder
with respect to such payment shall be reinstated upon such restoration or
return being made by Seller, all as though such payment had not been made.
The Purchaser Direct Parent acknowledges that it will receive substantial
direct and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

  

(c)  The Purchaser Direct Parent hereby expressly acknowledges
and agrees to be bound by the following provisions of this Agreement: 
_Section 5.16(b)_ (Parent Shareholder Notice), _Section 11.1_ (Interpretation;
Absence of Presumption), _Section 11.2_  (Headings), _Section 11.3_
(Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Forum; Waiver of Jury Trial; Arbitration),
_Section 11.4_  (Sovereign Immunity), _Section 11.5_ (Entire Agreement),
_Section 11.9_ (Notices), _Section 11.10_ (Successors and Assigns), _Section
11.11_ (Amendments and Waivers), _Section 11.12_ (Severability), _Section
11.15_ (Counterparts),  _Section 11.16_ (Non-Recourse) and _Section 11.17_
(Purchaser Direct Parent Guarantee).

  

11.18   _ ____Seller Parent Guarantee_.

  

(a)  The Seller Parent, as primary obligor and not merely as
surety, hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the
full and timely payment and performance of all Liabilities (including
indemnities, fees and Liabilities in respect of equitable relief) of the
Seller incurred under, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements, as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented in accordance with their terms (such Liabilities, the " _Seller
Parent Guaranteed Obligations_ "). This is a guarantee of payment and
performance, and not of collectability. The obligations of the
Purchaser Direct Parent under this _Section 11.18_ are absolute and
unconditional in respect of satisfying the Seller Parent
Guaranteed Obligations and shall be enforceable against the Seller Parent to
the same extent as if the Seller Parent were the primary obligor (and not
merely a surety) under this Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements.

  

(b)  The Seller Parent hereby waives as to itself promptness,
diligence, notice of the acceptance of this guarantee and of the Seller
Parent Guaranteed Obligations, presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-
performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of any Seller Parent
Guaranteed Obligations incurred, all defenses which may be available by virtue
of any valuation, stay, moratorium Law or other similar Law now or hereafter
in effect, and all suretyship defenses (it being understood that nothing
in this sentence shall be deemed a waiver by the Seller Parent of the
obligation of any other Party to deliver notice pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements). The Seller Parent agrees that the
Seller Parent Guaranteed Obligations shall not be discharged except by
complete performance or payment of the amounts payable under this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement, as applicable, and that

    

-100-

 



    

the obligations of the Seller Parent hereunder shall not be released or
discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure or
