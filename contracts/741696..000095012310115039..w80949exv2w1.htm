by Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Parent proposes
to cause Merger Sub to make a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted
under this Agreement, the &#147;<B>Offer</B>&#148;) to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock for consideration of a price per share of Company Common Stock of $38.00 (such amount, or any

the seller in cash, without interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this

amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the &#147;<B>Exchange

accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the
Offer are subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Exhibit&nbsp;A (the &#147;<B>Offer

in its sole discretion, to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or modify the
terms of the Offer; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that, without the prior written
consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i)&nbsp;reduce the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii)&nbsp;reduce the Offer Price, (iii)&nbsp;change, modify or
waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (iv)&nbsp;impose conditions to the Offer in addition to the

adverse in any material respect to any holders of Company Common Stock, (v)&nbsp;except as
otherwise provided in this Section&nbsp;1.1(a) or Section&nbsp;1.1(b), extend or otherwise change the

adverse in any material respect to any holders of Company Common Stock. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion, without
consent of the Company, (A)&nbsp;without limiting Parent&#146;s or Merger Sub&#146;s obligations under the
following sentence, extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of
up to ten Business Days each, with the length of such period to be determined by Parent or
Merger Sub (or such longer period as the parties hereto may agree), if on any then-scheduled

extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position

Expiration Date, all of the Offer Conditions (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) shall
have been satisfied or have been waived, such that the number of shares of Company Common
Stock validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn is less than that number of
shares of Company Common Stock which, when combined with the Top-Up Shares to be issued to
Merger Sub upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, would result in Merger Sub owning one more

Company Common Stock issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option) (the &#147;<B>Short-Form&nbsp;Merger

Article&nbsp;VIII. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section&nbsp;8.1, prior to the acceptance for payment of Company
Common Stock tendered in the Offer, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any
depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered Company Common Stock to

Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning such
Person to the other as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation,

upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or

correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or

comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i)&nbsp;shall provide Parent an
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final
version of such document or response or any amendment to any such document) and (ii)&nbsp;shall
include in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by Parent. If, at any
time prior to the Shareholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or
any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, so that the Proxy Statement does not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not

actions specified in Sections&nbsp;6.1(b)(i), (ii)&nbsp;and (iii). The Company shall duly convene and
hold the Shareholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after the mailing of the
Proxy Statement; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that in no event shall such meeting be
held later than 35 calendar days following the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to the
Company&#146;s shareholders. The notice of such Shareholders Meeting shall state that a
resolution to approve this Agreement will be considered at the Shareholders Meeting. The
Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend to shareholders of the Company that they
approve this Agreement, and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement.
Parent may require the Company to, and if so required the Company shall, adjourn or postpone

Company shall have received an aggregate number of proxies voting for the adoption of this

shall not change such record date or establish a different record date for the Shareholders
Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent, unless required to do so by applicable
Law or the Company Bylaws. Unless the Board of Directors of the Company shall have effected

solicited in compliance with all applicable Laws and all rules of NASDAQ. Unless this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section&nbsp;8.1, the Company shall submit
this Agreement to its shareholders at the Shareholders Meeting even if the Company Board
shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change or proposed or announced any intention
to do so. The Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent, advise Parent at least
on a daily basis on each of the last ten Business Days prior to the date of the Shareholders
Meeting as to the aggregate tally of proxies received by the Company with respect to the
Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, following the Offer and any
subsequent offering period and the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up Option, Parent and its
Subsidiaries shall own at least 90% of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock,
the parties hereto shall take all necessary and appropriate action, including with respect
to the transfer to Merger Sub of any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent or any
