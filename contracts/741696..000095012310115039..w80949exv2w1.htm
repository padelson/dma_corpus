ARTICLE I 
  _THE OFFER_  

   

 Section 1.1 _The Offer_. 

   

 (a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act"), the Offer. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Exhibit A (the "Offer Conditions"). The Offer shall expire at midnight, New York City time, on the 20th Business Day following the commencement of the Offer (determined pursuant to Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) (such time, the "Initial Expiration Date," and such time, or such subsequent time to which the expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the "Expiration Date"). Merger Sub expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or modify the terms of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) change, modify or waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (iv) impose conditions to the Offer in addition to the conditions set forth in Exhibit A or modify or change any Offer Condition in a manner adverse in any material respect to any holders of Company Common Stock, (v) except as otherwise provided in this Section 1.1(a) or Section 1.1(b), extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date of the Offer, (vi) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer or (vii) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the terms of the Offer in a manner adverse in any material respect to any holders of Company Common Stock. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion, without consent of the Company, (A) without limiting ParentÂ’s or Merger SubÂ’s obligations under the following sentence, extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to ten Business Days each, with the length of such period to be determined by Parent or Merger Sub (or such longer period as the parties hereto may agree), if on any then-scheduled Expiration Date of the Offer any of the Offer Conditions shall not have 

   ##### 

  

    

been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Merger Sub, waived, and
(B) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer. Parent and Merger Sub
agree that, to the extent requested in writing by the Company prior to any
then-scheduled Expiration Date of the Offer, but subject to ParentÂ’s right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, Merger Sub shall (and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) (A) if any of the Offer Conditions set
forth in clause (ii) of Exhibit A or in paragraph (a) or (b) of clause (iii)
of Exhibit A shall not have been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by
Parent or Merger Sub, waived, and provided that it is reasonably expected
that such condition or conditions shall be satisfied prior to the Termination
Date, extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of
up to ten Business Days each, with the length of such period to be determined
by Parent or Merger Sub (or such longer period as the parties hereto may
agree), until such time as such Offer Conditions are satisfied (but not
beyond the Termination Date) and (B) if any of the Minimum Tender Condition
or the Offer Conditions set forth in paragraph (d) or (e) of clause (iii)
of Exhibit A shall not have been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by
Parent or Merger Sub, waived on such then-scheduled Expiration Date, but all
the other Offer Conditions set forth in Exhibit A shall be satisfied on such
then-scheduled Expiration Date, extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in
consecutive increments of up to ten Business Days each, with the length of
such period to be determined by Parent or Merger Sub (or such longer period as
the parties hereto may agree), for an aggregate period of time of not more
than 20 Business Days; _provided_ , _however_ , that Merger Sub shall not be
required to extend the Offer beyond the Termination Date. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 1.1(a), if, at any Expiration Date, all of the Offer Conditions (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) shall have been satisfied or have been waived, such that the number of shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn is less than that number of shares of Company Common Stock which, when combined with the Top-Up Shares to be issued to Merger Sub upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, would result in Merger Sub owning one more share than 90% of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding (including any shares of Company Common Stock issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option) (the "Short-Form Merger Threshold"), then in such case Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion, without the consent of the Company: 

   

 (i) extend the Offer for one or more successive periods of up to 10 Business days each, with the length of such period to be determined by Parent or Merger Sub (or any longer period as may be requested by Merger Sub and approved in advance by the Company, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld), until the Termination Date in order to permit additional shares of Company Common Stock to be tendered into the Offer such that the Short-Form Merger Threshold may be attained; or 

   

 (ii) if the Clearance Date has occurred, terminate the Offer pursuant to Section 1.1(d). 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept and pay for (subject to any withholding of Tax pursuant to Section 1.1(g)) all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the Expiration Date of the Offer. Acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to and subject to the conditions of the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Closing," and the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Closing Date." Merger Sub expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to extend the Offer for a "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act following the Offer Closing, and the Offer Documents may, in Merger SubÂ’s sole discretion, provide for such a reservation of right. The Offer may not be terminated prior to its Expiration Date, unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Article VIII. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, prior to the acceptance for payment of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered Company Common Stock to the registered holders thereof. Nothing contained in this Section 1.1 shall affect any termination rights in Article VIII of this Agreement. The Company agrees that no shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than in a fiduciary capacity) will be tendered in the Offer. 

   

 (d) If at any then-scheduled Expiration Date (i) any Offer Condition shall not have been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Merger Sub, waived and (ii) the Clearance Date has occurred, then Merger Sub may irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the Offer is terminated pursuant to this Section 1.1(d), the Company shall proceed with and take all actions necessary to hold the Shareholders Meeting as promptly as practicable and use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies from the CompanyÂ’s shareholders in favor of the Merger for purposes of obtaining the Shareholder Approval in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 (e) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO filed under cover of Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal, summary advertisement and other ancillary documents (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents"). The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the Company required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by 

   ##### 

  

    

applicable Laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company upon
the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements, to the Offer Documents, and shall provide the
Company with copies of all correspondence between them and their
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to give the Company the opportunity
to participate in any substantive telephonic communications with the staff of
the SEC related thereto. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents
(including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or dissemination
thereof to the shareholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of
the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
Offer Documents or response (including the proposed final version thereof),
and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable consideration to any such
comments. 

   

 (f) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for, pursuant to the Offer. 

   

 (g) Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Merger Sub is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any other applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over by Merger Sub to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Merger Sub. 

  

 Section 1.2 _Company Actions._  

   

 (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (b) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") containing the Company Recommendation and shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the shareholders of the Company. The Company shall also include in the Schedule 14D-9, in its entirety, a copy of the opinion of BofA Merrill Lynch described in Section 4.1(s). Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and 

   ##### 

  

    

disseminated to the shareholders of the Company, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable Federal securities Laws. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Schedule 14D-9,
and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the
Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other
hand, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to give Parent the opportunity
to participate in any substantive telephonic communications with the staff of
the SEC related thereto. Prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (including
any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or mailing thereof to the
shareholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or
response (including the proposed final version thereof), and the Company
shall give reasonable consideration to any such comments. The Company hereby
consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company
Recommendation contained in the Schedule 14D-9. 

   

 (c) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall furnish or cause its transfer agent to furnish Parent and Merger Sub promptly with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Company Common Stock as of the most recent practicable date and of those Persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together with copies of all lists of shareholders, security position listings and computer files and all other information in the CompanyÂ’s possession or control regarding the record holders and beneficial owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to Merger Sub such information and assistance (including updated lists of shareholders, security position listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to holders of Company Common Stock. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files in accordance with the requirements of the Confidentiality Agreement dated August 17, 2010 between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall dispose of all copies of such information then in their possession or control in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 (d) The Company has been informed that all directors and executive officers of the Company intend to tender all of their respective shares of Company Common Stock, if any, in the Offer and that the Offer Documents may so state. 

  

 Section 1.3 _Top-Up Option._  

   

 (a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up Option"), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 1.3, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer Price up to that number of newly issued  shares of Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up Shares") equal to the lowest 

   ##### 

  

    

number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the
time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute one share more than
90% of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after the
issuance of the Top-Up Shares; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) the Top-Up
Option shall not be exercisable for a number of shares of Company Common
Stock in excess of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
authorized and unissued (treating shares held in the treasury of the Company
as unissued) and not reserved for issuance at the time of exercise of the
Top-Up Option and (ii) the exercise of the Top-Up Option and the issuance and
delivery of the Top-Up Shares shall not be prohibited by any Law (other than
any listing requirement of any national securities exchange) or Judgment. The
Top-Up Option shall be exercisable at any one time following the
Offer Closing and prior to the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and
(b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. The
obligation of the Company to issue and deliver the Top-Up Shares upon the
exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject only to the condition that no Legal
Restraint (other than any listing requirement of any national securities
exchange) that has the effect of preventing the exercise of the Top-Up Option
or the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Shares in respect of such exercise
shall be in effect. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the failure to obtain
approval of the CompanyÂ’s shareholders of the issuance of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Top-Up Option as a result of applicable stock exchange
listing requirements shall not cause any condition of the Offer not to
be met. Upon ParentÂ’s written request, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its transfer agent to certify in writing to Parent the
number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option after giving effect to
the issuance of the Top-Up Shares. The Company agrees that it shall reserve
and maintain free from preemptive rights out of its authorized but
unissued shares of Company Common Stock a sufficient number of shares of
Company Common Stock so that the Top-Up Option may be exercised subject only
to the reservation of such shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Company Stock Plans as in effect as of the date hereof. 

   

 (b) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Shares comply with all applicable Laws, including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Securities Act"). In the event Merger Sub elects to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall give the Company prior written notice, specifying (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of such notice and (ii) a place and a time for the closing of such purchase. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice (and, in any event, within two Business Days following such notice), deliver written notice to Merger Sub specifying, based on the information provided by Merger Sub in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares. At the closing of the purchase of Top-Up Shares, (i) the Company shall deliver to Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares and (ii) the purchase price owed by Merger Sub to the Company therefor shall be paid to the Company by issuance by Merger Sub to the Company of a non-negotiable and non-transferable 

   ##### 

  

    

promissory note, secured by the Top-Up Shares and bearing compounding interest
at 5% per annum, with principal and interest due one year after the purchase
of the Top-Up Shares, prepayable in whole or in part without premium or
penalty. The parties agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares to occur on the same day that
such notice is received by the Company, and if not so consummated on such
day, as promptly thereafter as possible. The parties further agree to use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated in
accordance with Section 1110 of the CCC and without a meeting of shareholders
as close in time as possible to (including, to the extent possible, on the
same day as) the issuance of the Top-Up Shares. Without the prior written
consent of the Company, the right to exercise the Top-Up Option granted
pursuant to this Agreement shall not be assigned by Merger Sub except to any
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent. 

   

 (c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Merger Sub is, and will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act). 

   

 (d) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation shall stipulate or take similar action in any appraisal proceeding pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CCC so that the dilutive impact on the value and number of shares of Company Common Stock as a result of the issuance of the Top-Up Shares will not be taken into account in any determination of the "fair market value" of any Dissenting Shares pursuant thereto as contemplated by Section 3.3, provided that the consideration paid by Merger Sub in exchange for such Top-Up Shares is likewise disregarded for such purpose.

ARTICLE III 
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL 
 STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT 
  _CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_  

   

 Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock._  

  

 At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or the holder of any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or Merger Sub: 

   

 (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub, without par value, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, without par value, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned as treasury stock by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 3.1(d), each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares and any shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.1(b)) shall be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, in cash and without interest, an amount equal to the Offer Price paid in the Offer (the "Merger Consideration") upon surrender of such share of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.2 and in compliance therewith. At the Effective Time, such shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate, or evidence of shares held in book-entry form, that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares (a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 (d) _Adjustment Events_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are, if permitted by the terms of this Agreement, changed into, or exchanged for, a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, split, combination, subdivision or reclassification of shares, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction, 

   ##### 

  

    

then the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration (as applicable) payable per
share of Company Common Stock shall be adjusted to fairly reflect the effects
of such transaction. 

  

 Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates._  

   

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with such bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the "Paying Agent"). At the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit with the Paying Agent funds in amounts and at the times necessary for the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(c) upon surrender of Certificates, it being understood that any and all interest or other amounts earned with respect to such funds shall be for the account of and turned over to Parent in accordance with Section 3.2(g). 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(c) (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed (or, if such shares of Company Common Stock are held in uncertificated, book-entry form, receipt of an "agentÂ’s message" by the Paying Agent (it being understood that any references herein to "Certificates" shall be deemed to include references to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock, provided that the holders of any book-entry shares shall not be required to surrender any Certificates in connection with the procedures set forth in this Article III)), and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if, upon presentation to the Paying Agent, such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article III. 

   

 (d) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any of their respective Representatives shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration that would otherwise have been payable in respect of any Certificate that is delivered to a public official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to the date which is 12 months after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay the Merger Consideration in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate. 

   

 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

   

 (g) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the date which is 12 months after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require 

   ##### 

  

    

the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest or other
amounts earned with respect thereto) that had been made available to the
Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates,
and thereafter, subject to the time limitations in Section 3.2(d), such
holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) as general creditors thereof
with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable
upon surrender of any Certificates held by such holders, as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. 

  

 Section 3.3 _Dissenter Rights._  

  

 Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a shareholder who is entitled to demand, and who properly demands, the fair market value of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Chapter 13 of the CCC (a "Dissenting Shareholder") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. For purposes of this Agreement, "Dissenting Shares" means any shares of Company Common Stock as to which a Dissenting Shareholder thereof has properly exercised a demand for fair market value pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CCC. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist. No Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to any Merger Consideration in respect of any Dissenting Shares unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holderÂ’s right to demand fair market value of its Dissenting Shares under the CCC, and any Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Chapter 13 of the CCC with respect to the Dissenting Shares owned by such Dissenting Shareholder and not any Merger Consideration. If any Person who otherwise would be deemed a Dissenting Shareholder shall have failed properly to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to demand fair market value with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as though such Dissenting Shares had been converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement if conditions to payment are met. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any written demands for fair market value, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company relating to shareholdersÂ’ demands for fair market value and (b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for fair market value under the CCC. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for fair market value of Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands. 

  

ARTICLE IV 
  _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_  

   

 Section 4.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Company._  

  

 Except as set forth (1) in the Company SEC Documents filed on or prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Filed Company SEC Documents") (other than any forward-looking disclosures contained in "Forward Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" sections of the Filed 

   ##### 

  

 

Company SEC Documents and any other disclosures included therein to the extent
they are primarily predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature) and
only to the extent reasonably apparent from the disclosure therein or (2) in
the disclosure schedule to this Agreement delivered by the Company to Parent
prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"),
the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

No Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement provides material health, medical or other welfare benefits after retirement or other termination of employment (other than continuation coverage required under Section 4980B(f) of the Code, Sections 601 through 609 of ERISA or analogous

   ##### 

  

    

Takeover Proposal was not solicited after the date hereof and did not

authorize its Affiliates and its and its AffiliatesÂ’ Representatives to, in
each case subject to compliance with Section 5.2(c) and the other provisions
of this Agreement, (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and

that are no less favorable to the Company than, those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal; provided, that (1) the
Company shall provide Parent with 24 hours prior written notice (or such
lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of the Board of Directors
of the Company or any committee thereof) of any meeting of the Board of
Directors of the Company or any such committee at which the directors of the
Company would reasonably be expected to consider any Takeover Proposal,

that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.2(a) by

Company of this Section 5.2(a).

 For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Superior Proposal" means any binding _bona fide_ written offer, which was not solicited after the date hereof and did not result from a breach of Section 5.2(a), made by any Person (other than Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates) that, if consummated, would result in such Person (or in the case of a direct merger between such Person and the Company, the shareholders of such Person) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or of the voting power of the CompanyÂ’s capital stock or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and which offer the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) (i) provides a higher value from a financial point of view to the shareholders of the Company than the consideration payable in the Offer and the Merger (taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of the Offer or this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or otherwise)), (ii) is reasonably likely to be completed in a timely fashion, taking into account the conditionality and likelihood of consummation and all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and (iii) for which financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or part), is then fully committed or reasonably determined to be available by the Board of Directors of the Company.. 

   

 (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw (or not continue to make), change, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw (or not continue to make), change, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation or any approval or recommendation by any such committee regarding this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger, or approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend any Takeover Proposal, or resolve or agree to take any such action, (ii) fail to publicly recommend against any Takeover Proposal or fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation or any approval or recommendation by any such committee regarding this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger within two Business Days after Parent so requests, (iii) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Offer Documents or the Proxy Statement, (iv) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or permit the Company or any of its Affiliates to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (each, an "Acquisition Agreement") constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement in accordance with Section 5.2(a)), or (v) take any other action or make any other public statement that is inconsistent with the Company Recommendation (any such action or resolution or agreement to take such action in clauses (i) Â— (v) above being referred to herein as an "Adverse Recommendation Change"). Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the first to occur of the Offer Closing 

   ##### 

  

    

and the Shareholders Meeting, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in
response to a Superior Proposal, after determining in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law, (x) effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change or (y) cause the Company to terminate
this Agreement in order to enter into a definitive Acquisition Agreement that
constitutes such Superior Proposal, _provided_ , concurrently with any such
termination, the Company pays to Parent the fee required by Section
6.6(b)(ii)(B) and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause
(y) shall be void and of no force or effect unless in advance of or
concurrently with such termination, the Company pays to Parent the
fee required by Section 6.6(b)(ii)(B); _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) the
Board of Directors of the Company may not effect any such Adverse
Recommendation Change and (2) no termination of this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 5.2(b) may be made, in each case unless the Company has complied
with all its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.2. No Adverse
Recommendation Change or termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 5.2(b) may be made unless (A) the Board of Directors shall have first
provided prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to (I) effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change (an "Adverse Recommendation Change Notice"),
which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances
giving rise to the proposed Adverse Recommendation Change, or (II) terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.2(b) in response to a
Superior Proposal (a "Superior Proposal Notice"), which notice shall identify
the Persons making such Superior Proposal, contain a description in
reasonable detail of the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and include a copy of the definitive Acquisition Agreement relating
to such Superior Proposal, together with any information required to
be delivered to Parent concurrently therewith pursuant to Section 5.2(a), and
(B) Parent does not make, within three Business Days after the receipt of
such notice (the "Notice Period"), a proposal that would, in the reasonable
good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor), permit
the Board of Directors to proceed with the Company Recommendation and not make
an Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the offer previously constituting a
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, as applicable.
Any material changes to any facts and circumstances giving rise to a proposed
Adverse Recommendation Change or to the financial terms or any material
change to other material terms of such Superior Proposal occurring prior to
the CompanyÂ’s effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.2(b) shall require the Company to provide
to Parent a new Adverse Recommendation Change Notice or Superior Proposal
Notice and a new Notice Period and to comply with the requirements of this
Section 5.2(b) with respect to each such new written notice. In determining
whether to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or whether to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.2(b), the Board of Directors of the
Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent, if Parent so desires, and
shall take into account any such changes to ParentÂ’s proposal that would, in
the reasonable good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor),
permit the Board of Directors to proceed with the Company Recommendation and
not make an Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the offer 

   ##### 

  

    

previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal, as the case may be. 

   

 (c) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 5.2, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable and in any event within 24 hours after the receipt thereof, advise Parent orally and in writing of (A) any Takeover Proposal or any request for information or inquiry that expressly contemplates or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal and (ii) the material terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry (including the identity of the bidder and any change to the financial terms, conditions or other material terms thereof). The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed of the status (including any change to the financial terms, conditions, or other material terms) of any such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry on a reasonably current basis (and in any event at ParentÂ’s request and otherwise no later than 24 hours after the occurrence of any material change, development, discussions or negotiations) and (B) provide to Parent, as soon as practicable and in any event within 24 hours after receipt or delivery thereof, copies of all draft agreements (and any other written material to the extent such material contains any financial terms, conditions or other material terms relating to any Takeover Proposal), written inquiries or correspondence sent by or provided to the Company (or its Representatives) in connection with any such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any Contract, in each case that prohibits the Company from providing such information to Parent. 

   

 (d) Except to the extent the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law, the Company agrees that it shall not terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any standstill, confidentiality or non-solicitation agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and that relates to a Takeover Proposal, and the Company shall take all necessary actions and use its reasonable best efforts to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the provisions of any such agreement, including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof. 

   

 (e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from making any disclosure to its shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with outside legal counsel), failure so to disclose is reasonably likely to result in a breach of applicable Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the taking of any such position or making of any such disclosure shall be subject to and only taken in compliance with Section 5.2(b) and that the Company shall, to the extent practicable, provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to comment on and review any such disclosure and, _provided_   _further_ , that any disclosure other than (i) a factually accurate statement by the Company that only describes the CompanyÂ’s receipt of a Takeover Proposal, the identity of the Person or group making such proposal, the terms and conditions thereof and the operation of this

  _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_  

   

 Section 6.1 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meeting._  

   

 (a) As promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 10 Business Days after the Offer is commenced), the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning such Person to the other as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final version of such document or response or any amendment to any such document) and (ii) shall include in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by Parent. If, at any time prior to the Shareholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company. 

   

 (b) At any time after the later of (A) the Initial Expiration Date, (B) the expiration of the time period contemplated by Rule 14a-6(a) under the Exchange Act and (C) the resolution of any comments on the Proxy Statement from the SEC (the "Clearance Date"), the Company shall have the right to (i) establish a record date (which will be as promptly as reasonably practicable), (ii) duly call and give notice of a meeting of its shareholders (the "Shareholders Meeting") and (iii) cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after such record date, each for the purpose of obtaining the Shareholder

Approval. If not previously undertaken by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall have the right, at any time within 10 Business Days after the Clearance
Date, to request in writing that the Company, and upon receipt of such
written request, the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable
(and in any event within 10 Business Days) take the actions specified in
Sections 6.1(b)(i), (ii) and (iii). The Company shall duly convene and hold
the Shareholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
mailing of the Proxy Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall such meeting be held later than 35 calendar days following the date the
Proxy Statement is mailed to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders. The notice of such
Shareholders Meeting shall state that a resolution to approve this Agreement
will be considered at the Shareholders Meeting. The Board of Directors of the
Company shall recommend to shareholders of the Company that they approve this
Agreement, and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement. Parent may require the Company to, and if so required the Company
shall, adjourn or postpone the Shareholders Meeting one time (for a period of
not more than 30 calendar days but not past 2 Business Days prior to the
Termination Date), unless prior to such adjournment the Company shall have
received an aggregate number of proxies voting for the adoption of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Merger), which have not been withdrawn, such that the condition in Section
7.1(a) will be satisfied at such meeting. Once the Company has established a
record date for the Shareholders Meeting, the Company shall not change such
record date or establish a different record date for the Shareholders Meeting
without the prior written consent of Parent, unless required to do so by
applicable Law or the Company Bylaws. Unless the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance
with Section 5.2(b), the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit
proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and shall ensure that all
proxies solicited in connection with the Shareholders Meeting are solicited
in compliance with all applicable Laws and all rules of NASDAQ. Unless
this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, the
Company shall submit this Agreement to its shareholders at the Shareholders
Meeting even if the Company Board shall have effected an Adverse
Recommendation Change or proposed or announced any intention to do so. The
Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent, advise Parent at
least on a daily basis on each of the last ten Business Days prior to the
date of the Shareholders Meeting as to the aggregate tally of proxies
received by the Company with respect to the Shareholder Approval.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, following the Offer and any subsequent
offering period and the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up Option, Parent and
its Subsidiaries shall own at least 90% of the outstanding shares of the
Company Common Stock, the parties hereto shall take all necessary and
appropriate action, including with respect to the transfer to Merger Sub of
any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent, to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable
after the Offer Closing without the Shareholders Meeting in accordance with
the CCC. 

   

 (c) At the Shareholders Meeting, if any, Parent agrees to cause all shares of Company Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Offer and all other shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to be voted in favor of the Merger.

Section 6.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality._  

   

 The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to ParentÂ’s Representatives access upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours to all their respective properties, assets, books, records, Contracts, Permits, documents, information, directors, officers and employees, but only to the extent that such access does not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish to Parent any information concerning its business as Parent may reasonably request;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to (or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to) afford such access or furnish such information to the extent that doing so is restricted under applicable Law or otherwise would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege). Following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, Parent may (but shall not be required to), following reasonable notice to the Company, contact and interview any Company Personnel and review the personnel records and such other information concerning the Company Personnel as Parent may reasonably request, provided such review is permitted by applicable Law. Except as required by any applicable Law or Judgment, Parent will hold, and will direct its Representatives to hold, any and all information received from the Company confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives and no other receipt of information by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives, whether before or after the date of this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect the representations, warranties, obligations, covenants and agreements of the Company (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement.

In connection with and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, if any objections are asserted with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby under any Competition Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or any private party, challenging the Offer, the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Competition Law, or which would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate with each other and shall use reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries may, without the prior written consent of Parent (which may be withheld in ParentÂ’s sole discretion), pursuant to this Section 6.3, (i) sell, divest, lease, license,

or interests therein or (B) ParentÂ’s ability to vote, transfer, receive
dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with respect to the
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation except with respect to Parent and
Merger Sub in the case of clause (iii) or (iv) as would not reasonably be
expected to (1) have a material adverse effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (without giving effect to the Offer or the
Merger), or (2) materially and adversely diminish the benefits expected to be
derived by Parent from the consummation of the Merger and other transactions
contemplated herein. 

  

 (d) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of (i) any written notice or other written communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is required in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) its discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, cause any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in Exhibit A hereto to be not satisfied at the scheduled Expiration Date (iii) its discovery of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement being or becoming untrue in any material respect or the failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, obligation or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by the Company; (iv) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity received by the Company in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and a copy of any such notice or communication shall be furnished to Parent together with the CompanyÂ’s notice; (v) any filing made by the Company with any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, a copy which shall be furnished to Parent together with the CompanyÂ’s notice; and (vi) any suits, actions, investigations or proceedings commenced or threatened that relate to the consummation of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement of which the Company has Knowledge; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, obligations, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

   ##### 

  

    

in each case in any way that would reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the consummation by Parent of the
Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

representations, warranties, obligations, covenants or agreements of the
parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to
the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. 

  

 (f) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in and shall keep Parent promptly informed with respect to the defense of any litigation against the Company and/or its directors or officers relating to the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and will obtain the prior written consent of Parent prior to settling or satisfying any such claim, it being understood and agreed that the Company shall control such defense and that this Section 6.3(f) shall not give Parent the right to direct such defense, except to the extent that Parent or Merger Sub is named as a defendant in such litigation and in that case solely as to the defense of Parent and Merger Sub. 

  

Section 6.4 _Equity Awards._  

   

 (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company agrees that the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans and the Purchase Plan) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions (including obtaining any consents, waivers or amendments, as required by the terms of any Company Stock Option, Company Restricted Share or the Purchase Plan, or as reasonably requested by Parent) as may be required to effect the following: 

   

 (i) at the earlier of the Offer Closing or the Effective Time, each unexercised Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Offer Closing or the Effective Time, as the case may be, shall be canceled, with the holder of such Company Stock Option becoming entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, an amount in cash equal to (A) the excess of (1) the Offer Price over (2) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option (whether vested or unvested) immediately prior to the Offer Closing or the Effective Time, as the case may be, which amount shall be payable to such holder at or as soon as practicable following the Offer Closing or the Effective Time, as the case may be (and in any event within two Business Days);

   ##### 

  

    

such amount to such holder at or as soon as practicable (and in any event

Share in accordance with its terms; and 

   

 (iii) with respect to the Purchase Plan, (A) participation shall be limited to those employees who are participants on the date of this Agreement; (B) no Purchase Period (as defined in the Purchase Plan) shall be commenced after the date of this Agreement; (C) if, with respect to a Purchase Period in effect on the date of this Agreement, the Offer Closing Date (or, if the Offer has been terminated, the Closing Date) occurs prior to the Purchase Date (as defined in the Purchase Plan) for such Purchase Period, upon the Offer Closing Date (or the Closing Date, as the case may be), each purchase right under the Purchase Plan outstanding immediately prior to the Offer Closing Date (or the Closing Date, as the case may be) shall be used to purchase from the Company whole shares of Company Common Stock (subject to the provisions of the Purchase Plan regarding the maximum number and value of shares purchasable per participant) at the applicable price determined under the terms of the Purchase Plan for the then outstanding Purchase Period using such date as the final Purchase Date for such Purchase Period, and any remaining accumulated but unused payroll deductions shall be distributed to the relevant participants without interest as promptly as practicable following the Offer Closing Date (or the Closing Date, as the case may be); and (D) the Purchase Plan shall terminate, effective upon the earlier of the Purchase Date for the Purchase Period in effect on the date of this Agreement and the Offer Closing Date (or, if the Offer has been terminated, the Closing Date).

Any Person making a payment pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from that payment such amounts as the payor is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over by any Person pursuant to this Section 6.4 to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person entitled to payment under this Section 6.4 in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by a Person pursuant to this Section 6.4.

 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company will not, after the date hereof, enter into, establish, amend or modify any plan, program, agreement or arrangement pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to any Company Personnel unless, prior to such entry into, establishment, amendment or modification, the Compensation Committee shall have taken all such steps as may be necessary to (i) approve as an Employment Compensation Arrangement each such plan, program, agreement or arrangement and (ii) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program, agreement or arrangement. 

  

 Section 6.11 _Company Benefit Plan Matters._  

   

 (a) During the period from the Effective Time until December 31, 2011, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to Persons who are employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and who remain in the employment of the Company and its Subsidiaries on or after the Effective 

   ##### 

  

    

Time (the "Continuing Employees") compensation (including base salary and
incentive and bonus opportunities, but excluding equity-based compensation)
and benefits (including paid time off, 401(k), health and severance) that are
materially no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to the
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) The service of each Continuing Employee with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor employer) prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as service with Parent and its Subsidiaries under each Parent Benefit Plan that Parent makes available to the Continuing Employees for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit levels and accruals (other than benefit levels and accruals under any retirement, pension or savings plan, except that such service shall be treated as service with Parent and its Subsidiaries for purposes of the 60-consecutive-month employment requirement for determining the level of matching contribution to which the person may be eligible under the Raytheon Savings and Investment Plan), but not in any case where credit would result in duplication of benefits. The term "Parent Benefit Plan" means any of the following plans, programs, policies or arrangements established or maintained by Parent: each (A) "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), (B) "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), (C) post-retirement or employment health or medical plan, program, policy or arrangement, (D) bonus, incentive or deferred compensation or equity or equity-based compensation plan, program, policy or arrangement, (E) severance, change in control, retention or termination plan, program, policy or arrangement or (F) other material compensation or benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement, including fringe benefits, vacation pay, service awards and reimbursement of moving expenses. 

   

 (c) Following the Effective Time, for purposes of each Parent Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit plan in which any Continuing Employee or his or her eligible dependents is eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive any pre-existing condition, exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting period to the extent such condition, exclusion, requirement or waiting period was satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement as of the Effective Time (or, if later, any applicable plan transaction date) and (ii) provide full credit for any co-payments, deductibles or similar payments made or incurred prior to the Effective Time for the plan year in which the Effective Time (or such transition date) occurs. 

   

 (d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with its terms, each Company Benefit Plan and Company Benefit Agreement and all obligations thereunder, including any rights or benefits arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event), and Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the Offer and the Merger constitutes a change of control or change in control, as the case may be, for all purposes under such Company Benefit Plans and Company Benefit Agreements. 

  

 Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to employ any Continuing Employee for any length of time following the Effective 

   ##### 

  

 

Time, subject to the CompanyÂ’s compliance with any applicable severance or
change of control arrangements. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, shall be construed to prevent Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from
(i) terminating, or modifying the terms of employment of, any Continuing
Employee following the Effective Time or (ii) terminating or modifying to any
extent any Company Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Agreement, Parent Benefit
Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may establish or maintain; _provided_
, _however_ , that to the extent that, and for so long as, a Continuing
Employee remains employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries during the
period following the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2011, the
compensation and benefits payable to such employee during such period shall
be subject to Section 6.11(a). No covenant or other undertaking in this
Agreement shall constitute an amendment to any employee benefit plan,
program, policy or arrangement, and any covenant or undertaking that suggests
that an employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement will be amended
shall be effective only upon the adoption of a written amendment in
accordance with the amendment procedures of such plan, program, policy
or arrangement. 

   

 Section 6.12 _Retention Agreements_. 

  

 If requested by Parent after the date hereof, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain executed retention and non-competition agreements with Parent from employees of the Company that are identified by Parent. 

  

 Section 6.13 _Stock Exchange Delisting._  

  

 Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law and the rules and policies of NASDAQ to cause the delisting of the shares of Company Common Stock from NASDAQ to occur as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and deregistration of such shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting.

The failure or delay by any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall any single or partial exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement.

 Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable or is declined, the federal court of the United States of America and all state courts sitting in the State of Delaware) and all courts to which an appeal may be taken from such courts for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement (and agrees that no such action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated herein shall be brought by it or any of its Subsidiaries except in such courts). Each of the parties further agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such PersonÂ’s respective address set forth above shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding in the State of Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding sentence. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives (and agrees not to plead or claim) any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable or is declined, in any Delaware state court or the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware) or that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. 

  

 Section 9.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial._  

  

 Each party hereto hereby knowingly and voluntarily waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no Representative of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 9.10. 

  

 Section 9.11 _Enforcement._  

  

 The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that the party seeking such 

   ##### 

  

 

injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief has an adequate
remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or equity. In the event that any party seeks an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, such party shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
injunction or other Judgment. 

   

 Section 9.12 _Consents and Approvals._  

  

 For any matter under this Agreement requiring the consent or approval of any party to be valid and binding on the parties hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing and executed and delivered to the other parties by a Person duly authorized by such party to do so. 

  

 Section 9.13 _Severability._  

  

 If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof.

 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer and, subject to the terms of Section 1.1 and Article VIII of the Agreement, may terminate, postpone or amend the Offer if: 

  

 (i) there shall not be validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date that number of shares of Company Common Stock which, when added to the shares of Company Common Stock already owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries, represents at least 76.3% of the total number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as of the Expiration Date (the "Minimum Tender Condition"); 

  

 (ii) any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the Offer or the Merger under any Competition Law shall not have been terminated or shall not have expired or any consent or approval of, notice to or filing with any Governmental Entity that is required to be obtained or made in connection with the Offer or the Merger shall not have been so made or obtained; 

  

 (iii) any of the following events shall exist on the Expiration Date or immediately prior to the Offer Closing: 

   

 (a) there shall be any Law or Judgment enacted, enforced, amended, issued, in effect or deemed applicable to the Offer or the Merger (other than the application of the waiting period provisions of any Competition Law to the Offer or to the Merger) the effect of which is to directly or indirectly enjoin, make illegal or otherwise prohibit or materially delay consummation of the Offer or the Merger; 

   

 (b) there shall exist or be instituted, pending or overtly threatened in writing any claim, suit, action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity seeking any of the consequences referred to in paragraph (a) above; 

   

 (c) there shall have occurred following the execution of the Agreement any Event which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; 

   

 (d) (1) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 4.1(c) shall not be true and correct in all respects (other than _de minimis_  exceptions) as of the date of the Agreement and as of such time; 

   

 (2) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the first sentence of Section 4.1(a), in Section 4.1(d)(i), Section 4.1(r), Section 4.1(s) or Section 4.1(u) that are qualified as to materiality or Material 

   ##### 

  

    

Adverse Effect shall not be true and correct in all respects, and any
such representations or warranties that are not so qualified shall not be
true and correct in any material respect, in each case as of the date of the
Agreement and as of such time, except to the extent such representations and
warranties relate to an earlier time (in which case on and as of such earlier
time); or 

   

 (3) any representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the Agreement (other than those listed in the preceding clauses (1) and (2)) shall not be true and correct as of the date of the Agreement and as of such time, except to the extent such representations and warranties relate to an earlier time (in which case on and as of such earlier time), except in the case of this clause (3) to the extent that the facts or matters as to which such representations and warranties are not so true and correct (without giving effect to any qualifications and limitations as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein), individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; 

   

 (e) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect any obligation, agreement or covenant required to be performed by it under the Agreement and such failure to perform shall not have been cured to the good faith satisfaction of Parent; 

   

 (f) Parent and Merger Sub shall have failed to receive a certificate of the Company, executed by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of the Company, dated as of the Offer Closing Date, to the effect that the conditions set forth in paragraphs (d) and (e) above have not occurred; 

   

 (g) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have withdrawn or modified (including by amendment of the Schedule 14D-9) in a manner adverse to Merger Sub the Company Recommendation or Parent shall have received an Adverse Recommendation Change Notice; or 

   

 (h) in the event that the exercise of the Top-Up Option is necessary to ensure that Parent or Merger Sub owns at least one more share than 90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock immediately after the Offer Closing, (1) the shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option together with the shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn are insufficient for Merger Sub to own at least one more share than 90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock immediately after the Offer Closing (after giving effect to such exercise) or (2) there shall exist under applicable Law or other Legal Restraint any restriction or legal impediment on Merger SubÂ’s ability and right to exercise the Top-Up Option or the CompanyÂ’s ability to issue the Top-Up Shares; or 

  

 (iv) the Company and Parent shall have reached an agreement that the Offer or the Agreement be terminated, or the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms. 

   ##### 

  

  

 The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. 

  

 The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub, may be asserted by Parent or Merger Sub regardless of the circumstances (including any action or inaction by Parent or Merger Sub, provided that nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from any obligation or liability such party has under the Agreement) giving rise to any such conditions and may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion (except for the Minimum Tender Condition), in each case, subject to the terms of the Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time. 

  

 For purposes of determining whether the Minimum Tender Condition has been satisfied, Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to include or exclude for purposes of its determination thereof shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures. 

  

 All capitalized terms used but not defined in this Exhibit A shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement and Plan of Merger to which this Exhibit A is attached.
