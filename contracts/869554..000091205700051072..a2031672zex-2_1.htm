<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as of November&nbsp;9, 2000, by and among Cisco

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Boards of Directors of Company, Parent and Merger Sub believe it is in the best interests of their respective companies and the
stockholders of their respective companies that Company and Merger Sub combine into a single company through the statutory merger of Merger Sub with and into Company (the "Merger") and, in furtherance
thereof, have approved the Merger. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant
to the Merger, among other things, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, no par value ("Company Common Stock"), shall be converted into shares of
Parent Common Stock, $0.001&nbsp;par value ("Parent Common Stock"), at the rate set forth herein. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;&nbsp;Company,
Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations and warranties and other agreements in connection with the Merger. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section&nbsp;368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), and to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Sections&nbsp;368 of the Code. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently
with the execution of this Agreement and as an inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, (a)&nbsp;Company and Parent have
entered into a stock option agreement dated the date hereof in the form attached hereto as </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;A</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> (the "Option Agreement") providing for the
purchase by Parent of newly-issued shares of Company Common Stock, and (b)&nbsp;certain stockholders of Company have on the date hereof entered into a stockholder agreement in the form attached
hereto as </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;B</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> (the "Stockholder Agreement") to, among other things, vote the shares of Company Common Stock owned by such persons to
approve the Merger and against any competing proposals. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also,
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Company and Atlantis Group,&nbsp;Inc., a Washington corporation ("Newco"), have entered into an Asset
Purchase Agreement of even date herewith in the form attached hereto as </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;C</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") which agreement provides for
the sale of certain of Company's assets to Newco and the assumption of certain of Company's obligations and liabilities by Newco. </FONT></P>
