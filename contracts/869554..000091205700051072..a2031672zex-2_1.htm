AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION

  

 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as of November 9, 2000, by and among Cisco Systems, Inc., a California corporation ("Parent"), Aqua Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Merger Sub") and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and Active Voice Corporation, a Washington corporation ("Company"). 

   
 

RECITALS

  

 A. The Boards of Directors of Company, Parent and Merger Sub believe it is in the best interests of their respective companies and the stockholders of their respective companies that Company and Merger Sub combine into a single company through the statutory merger of Merger Sub with and into Company (the "Merger") and, in furtherance thereof, have approved the Merger. 

  

 B. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, no par value ("Company Common Stock"), shall be converted into shares of Parent Common Stock, $0.001 par value ("Parent Common Stock"), at the rate set forth herein. 

  

 C. Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations and warranties and other agreements in connection with the Merger. 

  

 D. The parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Sections 368 of the Code. 

  

 E. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as an inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, (a) Company and Parent have entered into a stock option agreement dated the date hereof in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the "Option Agreement") providing for the purchase by Parent of newly-issued shares of Company Common Stock, and (b) certain stockholders of Company have on the date hereof entered into a stockholder agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the "Stockholder Agreement") to, among other things, vote the shares of Company Common Stock owned by such persons to approve the Merger and against any competing proposals. 

  

 F. Also, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Company and Atlantis Group, Inc., a Washington corporation ("Newco"), have entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement of even date herewith in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") which agreement provides for the sale of certain of Company\'s assets to Newco and the assumption of certain of Company\'s obligations and liabilities by Newco. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

   
 

ARTICLE I 
THE MERGER

  

 1.1 _ The Merger._ At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the Articles of Merger attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware Law") and Washington Business Corporation Act ("Washington Law"), respectively, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Company shall continue as the surviving corporation. Company as the surviving corporation after the Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation." 

  

 1.2 _ Closing; Effective Time._ The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall take place as soon as practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth  in Article VI hereof or at such other time as the parties hereto agree (the
"Closing Date"). The Closing shall take place at the offices of Brobeck,
Phleger and Harrison LLP, Two Embarcadero Place, 2200 Geng Road, Palo Alto,
California 94303, or at such other location as the parties hereto agree. In
connection with the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to
be consummated by filing the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware and the Articles of Merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of Washington, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of Delaware Law and Washington Law (the time of the last such
filing being the "Effective Time").

  

 1.3 _ Effect of the Merger._ At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger, the Articles of Merger and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law and Washington Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.4 _ Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws._ 

  

   

 (a) At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of Company shall be amended so as to read in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit A_ to the Articles of Merger and as so amended shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by Washington Law and such Articles of Incorporation. 

  

 (b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended. 

   

  

 1.5 _ Directors and Officers._ At the Effective Time, the directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be those persons who were the directors of Merger Sub, in each case until their successors are elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier resignation or removal. The officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the initial officers of Merger Sub, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier resignation or removal. 

   

 1.6 _ Effect on Capital Stock._ By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any of the following securities: 

  

   

 (a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(b)) will be canceled and extinguished and be converted automatically into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock, all of which shall have been registered pursuant to Section 5.1, based on the Exchange Ratio, subject to any adjustments made pursuant to Section 1.6(d). The Exchange Ratio shall equal the ratio of (x) a quotient, the numerator of which is $295,332,740 and the denominator of which is the Parent Stock Price and (y) the total number of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding on a fully diluted basis at the Effective Time (after giving effect to the conversion, exchange or exercise as the case may be of all securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, Company Common Stock, including all unexpired and unexercised options, warrants or other rights to acquire Company Common Stock). The Parent Stock Price shall equal the average of the closing prices of Parent Common Stock as quoted on Nasdaq for the ten consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock Owned by Parent or Company._ At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by Company as treasury stock and each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or of Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof. 

   

     

  (c) _Company Stock Option Plans._ At the Effective Time, the Company
Stock Option Plans (as defined below) and all options to purchase Company
Common Stock then outstanding under the Company Stock Option Plans and all
obligations of Company under the Company ESPP (as defined below) shall be
assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 5.9.

  

 (d) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub._ At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, $0.001 par value, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (e) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio._ The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, so as to provide holders of Company Common Stock and Parent the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse split, stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization or like change. 

  

 (f) _Fractional Shares._ No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Parent Stock Price. 

   

  

 1.7 _ Surrender of Certificates._ 

  

  

 (a)

 _Exchange Agent._ Parent\'s transfer agent shall act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger. 
  

    

 (b) _Parent to Provide Common Stock and Cash._ Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article I, through such reasonable procedures as Parent may adopt, (i) the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.6(a) in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (provided that delivery of any shares that are subject to vesting and/or repurchase rights or other restrictions shall be in book entry form until such vesting and/or repurchase rights or other restrictions lapse) and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to permit payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(e). 

  

 (c) _Exchange Procedures._ Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, whose shares were converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon receipt of the Certificates by the Exchange Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates (or book entries in the case of shares that are subject to vesting and/or 

   

     

 repurchase rights or other restrictions) representing shares of Parent
Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares). Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a certificate (or book entry in the case of
shares that are subject to vesting and/or repurchase rights or other
restrictions) representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
and payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 1.6, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, each outstanding
Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Company
Common Stock will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all
corporate purposes, other than the payment of dividends, to evidence the
ownership of the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock into which such
shares of Company Common Stock shall have been so converted and the right to
receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in
accordance with Section 1.6. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to
holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article I.

  

 (d) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares._ No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable (but for the provisions of this Section 1.7(d)) with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 (e) _Transfers of Ownership._ If any certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (f) _No Liability._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.7, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any party hereto shall be liable to any person for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

  

 1.8 _ No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I. 

     1.9 _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ In the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of
Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) as may be
required pursuant to Section 1.6; provided, however, that Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such
sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

 1.10 _ Tax Consequences._ It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. 

  

 1.11 _ Withholding Rights._ Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the number of shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise deliverable under this Agreement, and from any other payments made pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as Parent and the Surviving Corporation are required to deduct and withhold with respect to such delivery and payment under the Code or any provision of state, local, provincial or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent and the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.12 _ Termination of Exchange Agent Funding._ Any portion of funds (including any interest earned thereon) or certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock held by the Exchange Agent which have not been delivered to holders of Certificates pursuant to this Article I within six months after the Effective Time shall promptly be paid or delivered, as appropriate, to Parent, and thereafter holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with the exchange procedures set forth in and contemplated by Section 1.7 shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) for their claim for shares of Parent Common Stock and, only as general creditors thereof, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions (with a record date after the Effective Time) with respect to Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled. 

  

 1.13 _ Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action._ If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of Company and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement. 

   
 

ARTICLE II 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

  

 In this Agreement, any reference to any event, change, condition or effect being "material" with respect to any person means any material event, change, condition or effect related to the condition (financial or otherwise), properties, assets (including intangible assets), liabilities, business, operations or results of operations of such person and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. In this Agreement, any reference to a "Material Adverse Effect" with respect to any person means any event, change or effect that is materially adverse to the condition (financial or otherwise), properties, assets, liabilities, business, operations or results of operations of such person and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, provided, however, that a "Material Adverse Effect" with respect to Company shall not include the following (collectively, "Non-Controllable Events"): (i) general changes in the telecommunications 

    industry or economic conditions that affect Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, substantially proportionately relative to the Parent and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) a decline in the revenues of Company

 2.1 _ Organization, Standing and Power._ Each of Company and its subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and no articles of dissolution have been filed under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Each of Company and its subsidiaries has the corporate power to own its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as presently proposed to be conducted and is duly authorized and qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would have a Material Adverse Effect on Company. Company has delivered to Parent a true and correct copy of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the "Articles of Incorporation"), and the Amended and Restated Bylaws, as amended, or other charter documents, as applicable, of Company and each of its subsidiaries, each as amended to date. Neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of its respective charter or bylaws or equivalent organization documents. Company is the owner of all outstanding shares of capital stock of each of its subsidiaries and all such shares are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each such subsidiary are owned by Company free and clear of all liens, charges, claims or encumbrances or rights of others. There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or agreements of any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or other securities of any such subsidiary, or otherwise obligating Company or any such subsidiary to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such securities. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents (as defined in Section 2.4), Company does not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association or entity.

    ESPP"). All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and are free of any liens or
encumbrances other than any liens or encumbrances created by or imposed upon
the holders thereof, and are not subject to preemptive rights or rights of

Company or any agreement to which Company is a party or by which it is bound.

commitment or agreement. There are no contracts, commitments or agreements
relating to voting, purchase or sale of Company\'s capital stock (i) between
or among Company and any of its stockholders and (ii) to the best of
Company\'s knowledge, between or among any of Company\'s stockholders. The
terms of the Company Stock Option Plans permit the assumption or substitution
of options to purchase Parent Common Stock as provided in this Agreement,

Company has also furnished Parent with the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination letter issued with respect to each such Company Employee Plan, and nothing has occurred since the issuance of each such letter which would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the tax-qualified status of any Company Employee Plan subject to Code Section 401(a). Company has also furnished Parent with all registration statements and prospectuses prepared in connection with each Company Employee Plan. 

  

 (c) None of the Company Employee Plans (including but not limited to Foreign Plans) promises or provides retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any person, except as required by applicable law; (ii) there has been no "prohibited transaction," as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, with respect to any Company Employee Plan, which would reasonably be expected to have, in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Company; (iii) each Company Employee Plan has been administered in accordance with its terms and in compliance with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, rules and regulations (including ERISA and the Code), except as would not have, in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Company, and Company and each subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate have performed in all material respects all obligations required to be

violation of, and have no knowledge of any material default or violation by
any other party to, any of the Company Employee Plans; (iv) neither Company
nor any subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate is subject to any material liability or
material penalty under Sections 4976 through 4980 of the Code or Title I of
ERISA with respect to any of the Company Employee Plans; (v) all material
contributions required to be made by Company or any subsidiary or ERISA
Affiliate to any Company Employee Plan have been made on or before their due
dates and a reasonable amount has been accrued for contributions to each
Company Employee Plan for the current plan years; (vi) with respect to each
Company Employee Plan, no "reportable event" within the meaning of Section
4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for which the thirty (30) day notice
requirement has been waived under the regulations to Section 4043 of ERISA)
nor any event described in Section 4062, 4063 or 4041 or ERISA has occurred;
(vii) no Company Employee Plan is covered by, and neither Company nor
any subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate has incurred or expects to incur any
liability under Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code; and (viii) each
Company Employee Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued
after the Effective Time in accordance with its terms, without liability to
Parent (other than for benefits accrued through the date of termination and
ordinary administrative expenses typically incurred in a termination event).
With respect to each Company Employee Plan subject to ERISA as either an
employee pension plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA or an
employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA,
Company has prepared in good faith and timely filed all requisite
governmental reports (which were true and correct as of the date filed) and
has properly and timely filed and distributed or posted all notices and
reports to employees required to be filed, distributed or posted with respect
to each such Company Employee Plan, except where the failure to do so would
not have a Material Adverse Effect. No suit, administrative proceeding, action
or other litigation has been brought, or to the knowledge of Company is
threatened, against or with respect to any such Company Employee Plan,
including any audit or inquiry by the IRS or United States Department of
Labor. No payment or benefit which will or may be made by Company to any
employee will be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

  

 (d) With respect to each Company Employee Plan, Company and each of its United States subsidiaries have complied except to the extent that such failure to comply would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Company, with (i) the applicable health care continuation and notice provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("COBRA") and the regulations (including proposed regulations) thereunder, (ii) the applicable requirements of the Family Medical and Leave Act of 1993 and the regulations thereunder, and (iii) the applicable requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations (including proposed regulations) thereunder. _Schedule 2.14(d) _ describes all obligations of the Company as of the date of this Agreement under any of the provisions of COBRA and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.

 (f) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) by Company, any Company subsidiary or other ERISA Affiliate relating to, or change in participation or coverage under, any Company Employee Plan which would 

   

     

 materially increase the expense of maintaining such Plan above the level of
expense incurred with respect to that Plan for the most recent fiscal quarter
included in Company\'s financial statements.

  

 (g) Company does not currently maintain, sponsor, participate in or contribute to, nor has it ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, or contributed to, any pension plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) which is subject to Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. 

  

 (h) Neither Company nor any Company subsidiary or other ERISA Affiliate is a party to, or has made any contribution to or otherwise incurred any obligation under, any "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

 (j) _Schedule 2.14(j)_ identifies each employee of any of the Company who is not fully available to perform work because of disability or other leave and sets forth the basis of such disability or leave and the anticipated date of return to full service. 

   

  

 2.15 _ Certain Agreements Affected by the Merger._ Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby will (i) result in any payment (including, without limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or otherwise) becoming due to any director or employee of Company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable by Company or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits.

The information supplied by Company for inclusion in the proxy statement/prospectus to be sent to the stockholders of Company in connection with the meeting of Company\'s stockholders to consider the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") (such proxy statement/prospectus as amended or supplemented is referred to herein as the "Proxy Statement") shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to Company\'s stockholders, at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting and at the Effective Time, contain any statement which, at such time, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading; or omit to state any material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Company Stockholders Meeting which has become false or misleading.

Since June 30, 2000 due provision was made on the books of Company in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices to provide for all slow-moving, obsolete, or unusable inventories to their estimated useful or scrap values and such inventory reserves are adequate to provide for such slow-moving, obsolete or unusable inventory and inventory shrinkage.

Company in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices in
accordance with GAAP since the last filed Company SEC Documents, represent
and will represent bona fide claims against debtors for sales and other
charges, are not subject to discount except for normal cash and immaterial
trade discount. The amount carried for doubtful accounts and allowances
disclosed in each of such Company SEC Document or accrued on such books is
sufficient to provide for any losses that may be sustained on realization of
the receivables.

 2.32 _ Export Control Laws._ Company has conducted its export transactions in accordance with applicable provisions of United States export control laws and regulations, including but not limited to the Export Administration Act and implementing Export Administration Regulations, except for such violations which would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Company.

Neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries has made any representations or warranties relating to the ability of any product or service of Company or its subsidiaries to be Year 2000 Compliant. Company has made inquiries to its key third-party vendors and providers as to the status of their Year 2000 efforts, and has not uncovered any problems that would aversely affect the operation of the products or that could disrupt or harm the day-to-day functioning of the business or operations of Company. 

   

 2.34 _ Representations Complete._ None of the representations or warranties made by Company herein or in any Schedule hereto, including the Company Disclosure Schedule, or certificate furnished by Company pursuant to this Agreement, or the Company SEC Documents, when all such documents

On the Closing Date, Company shall deliver to Parent an updated _Schedule 5.9(a) _hereto current as of such date. Each such option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Company Stock Option Plans and the applicable stock option agreements, immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) such option will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. At or prior to the Closing, Company shall take all actions required to prevent the cancellation or termination of such options upon the closing of the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, and to allow such options at the Effective Time to be converted into options to purchase Parent Common Stock as described above, without requiring the consent of the optionees. Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.9(a)(i) _of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Merger nor the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement will terminate any of the outstanding options under the Company Stock Plans or accelerate the exercisability or vesting of such options or the shares of Parent Common Stock which will be subject to those options upon Parent\'s assumption of the options in the Merger. Company has not granted any options under the Company Stock Option Plans intended to qualify as "incentive stock options" as defined in Section 422 of the Code. Within 30 business days after the Effective Time, Parent will issue to each person who, immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder of an outstanding option under the Company Stock Option Plans a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such option by Parent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for future issuance, and shall maintain such reservation for so long as any of the assumed options remain 

   

     

 outstanding, a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for
delivery upon the exercise of such options.

  

 (b) All outstanding rights of Company which it may hold immediately prior to the Effective Time to repurchase unvested shares of Company Common Stock (the "Repurchase Options") shall continue in effect following the Merger and shall thereafter continue to be exercisable by Parent upon the same terms and conditions in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the shares purchasable pursuant to the Repurchase Options and the purchase price per share shall be adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio. 

  

 (c) Outstanding purchase rights under the Company ESPP shall be exercised upon the next scheduled purchase date, December 31, 2000, under the Company ESPP, and each participant in the Company ESPP shall accordingly be issued shares of Company Common Stock at that. Company shall cause the Company ESPP to terminate with such exercise date, and no purchase rights shall be subsequently granted or exercised under the Company ESPP. Company employees who meet the eligibility requirements for participation in the Parent Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall be eligible to begin payroll deductions under that plan as of the start date of the first offering period thereunder beginning after the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) Within five (5) business days following the date of this Agreement, Company shall set forth on _Schedule 5.9(d) _a list of all persons who Company reasonably believes are, with respect to Company and as of the date of this Agreement, "disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder). For this purpose, Company shall assume that the fair market value of Company Common Stock is $20 per share. Within a reasonable period of time after the last business day of each month after the date of this Agreement and on or about the date five business days prior to the expected Closing Date, Company shall revise _Schedule 5.9(d) _to reflect the most recently available closing price of Company Common Stock as of the last business day of such month and to reflect any additional information which Company reasonably believes would impact the determination of persons who are, with respect to Company and as of the each such date, "disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder). 

  

 (e) If required by Parent in a written notice delivered to Company, the Board of Directors of the Company shall, prior to the Closing Date, execute a resolution either terminating or freezing the Company\'s benefit plan, that is intended to be qualified under sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code (the "Company\'s 401(k) Plan"), to be effective prior to the Closing Date. The Board of Directors of the Company shall adopt a corresponding amendment to Company\'s 401(k) Plan freezing contributions and participation as well as amending it for the relevant provisions of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 ("TRA "97"), the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 ("SBJPA"), the Uruguay Round Agreements Act ("GATT"), the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 ("USERRA"), and the Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 ("RRA"). Company\'s Employees shall be eligible to participate in Parent\'s benefit plan that is intended to be qualified under sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code as soon as administratively feasible following the Closing Date. 

  

 (f) Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain acceleration waivers in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E _(the "Waivers") from each of the individuals listed on _Schedule  5.9(f) _hereto and from any other employee other than a Transferred Employee who agrees to continue to be employed by Company and/or Parent after the Closing. 

  

 (g) Company shall amend the Company Stock Option Plans and all options outstanding under such Company Stock Option Plans to give each optionee a thirty (30) day period 

   

     

 following his or her termination of employment to exercise his or her option
and shall send to each optionee a notice of such change in form and substance
satisfactory to Parent.

The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm (in addition to local counsel) to represent them with respect to any single action unless there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between the position of any two or more Indemnified Parties. 

  

 (d) The provisions of this Section 5.16 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and representatives.

 Date shall be extended to March 30, 2001 in the event that if the only
reason the Closing shall not have occurred by February 28, 2001 is the failure
of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(b) and/or Section 6.1(d) (although
such extension shall not occur if the failure of such conditions has been
caused or resulted from one party\'s action or failure to act constituting a
breach of this Agreement and the other party does not consent to such
extension); and _provided further_ that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose action or
failure to act has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger
to occur on or before such date and such action or failure to act constitutes
a breach of this Agreement;

  

 (c) by Parent, if (i) Company shall breach any of its representations, warranties or obligations hereunder to an extent that would cause the condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) not to be satisfied and such breach shall not have been cured within ten (10) business days of receipt by Company of written notice of such breach (and Parent shall not have willfully breached any of its covenants hereunder, which breach is not cured), (ii) the Board of Directors of Company shall have withdrawn or modified its recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger in a manner adverse to Parent or shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing, (iii) Company shall have failed to comply with Section 4.3, (iv) the Board of Directors of Company shall have recommended, endorsed, accepted or agreed to a Takeover Proposal or shall have resolved to do so, or (v) for any reason Company fails to call and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting by February 14, 2001 or in the event the condition set forth in Section 6.1(b) shall not have been satisfied by February 14, 2001 under circumstances in which it can be reasonably expected that the Final Date will be extended pursuant to the proviso set forth in Section 7.1(b), March 15, 2001; 

  

 (d) by Company, if Parent shall breach any of its representations, warranties or obligations hereunder to an extent that would cause the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) not to be satisfied and such breach shall not have been cured within ten (10) business days following receipt by Parent of written notice of such breach (and Company shall not have willfully breached any of its covenants hereunder, which breach is not cured); 

  

 (e) by Parent if a Trigger Event (as defined in Section 7.3(e)) or Takeover Proposal shall have occurred and the Board of Directors of Company in connection therewith, does not within ten (10) business days of such occurrence (i) reconfirm its approval and recommendation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) reject such Takeover Proposal or Trigger Event (in the case of a Trigger Event involving a tender or exchange offer); or

    Section 5.4 (Confidentiality), Section 7.3 (Expenses and Termination Fees),
this Section 7.2 and Section 8.1 shall remain in full force and effect and
survive any termination of this Agreement. Nothing herein shall relieve any

 8.3 _ Interpretation._ When a reference is made in this Agreement to Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The phrase "made available" in this Agreement shall mean that the information referred to has been made available if requested by the party to whom such information is to be made available. The phrases "the date of this Agreement", "the date hereof", and terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires, shall be deemed to refer to November 9, 2000. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 8.4 _ Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

  

 8.5 _ Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest._ This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including the Exhibits, the Schedules, including the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the Closing, in accordance with its terms; (b) are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder, except as set forth in Sections 1.6(a)-(c) and (f), 1.7-1.9, 5.9, 5.10, 5.12 and 5.17; and (c) shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise except as otherwise specifically provided. 

     8.6 _ Severability._ In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

  

 8.7 _ Remedies Cumulative._ Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. 

  

 8.8 _ Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court located within the State of California in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of California for such persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction and such process. 

  

 8.9 _ Rules of Construction._ The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.
