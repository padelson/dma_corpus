ARTICLE II

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

SECTION 2.01 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

(a) _Conversion of Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Share_ " and
collectively, the " _Shares_ "), other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with _Section 2.01(b)_ or  _Section 2.04_, shall be canceled and
shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $127.20 in cash,
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The Merger Consideration is
payable in accordance with  _Section 2.02(b)_.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. Each Share held
in the treasury of the Company or owned by any direct or indirect wholly
owned Company Subsidiary and each Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled without any conversion thereof
and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) _Shares of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Company.

SECTION 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) appoint a
bank or trust company approved (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) in advance by the Company (the " _Paying
Agent_ "), and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Paying Agent for the payment
of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Article II_. At the

 



7  Closing, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Company to deposit,
with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid
pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_ (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the
" _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations
of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which
are then publicly available), or a combination of the foregoing. Any net
profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments
shall be payable to the Surviving Company.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be mailed to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of
record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.01(a)_: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary
form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Shares to the
Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
certificates evidencing such Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ " and, together,
the " _Certificates_ ") or the non-certificated Shares represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
to the Paying Agent for cancellation, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto (and such other documents as may customarily be required
by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_, and the Certificates so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment
of the Merger Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered are registered if the Certificate
representing such Shares shall be presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied
by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other taxes required solely by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such
tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 2.02_, each Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration to which the holder of such Certificate is entitled
pursuant to this _Article II_. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any
cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II_. Any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent
to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this _Article II_. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one
or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time be
entitled to receive, and the Surviving Company shall cause the Paying Agent to
pay and deliver as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time
(but in no event more than three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Merger
Consideration for each Book-Entry Share.

 



8 (c) _No Further Rights_. From and after the Effective Time, holders of Shares
shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of the Company, except as
provided herein or by Law.

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Shares six (6) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Company, upon demand, and
any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this  _Article
II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Company for, and
Parent and the Surviving Company shall remain liable for, payment of their
claim for the Merger Consideration (unless surrendered to a public official
pursuant to any escheat or similar Law). Any portion of the Payment Fund
remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or
Company Stock Options such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to such payment under all applicable federal, state or local Tax
laws and pay such withholding amount over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority. To the extent that amounts are so properly withheld by the Paying
Agent, the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Shares or Company Stock Options in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Company or Parent, as the case may be.

 

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, then upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and (ii) if
required by the Surviving Company, an indemnity bond in form and substance and
with surety reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Company, the Paying
Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.01(a)_.

 

SECTION 2.03 _Share Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the share transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by
Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for any reason shall be canceled
against delivery of the Merger Consideration to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_.

 



9 SECTION 2.04 _Company Stock Options, Restricted Stock Units and Performance
Stock Units_.

(a) At the Effective Time, (i) each outstanding option (each, a " _Company
Stock Option_ ") to purchase Shares granted under the Companys 2005 Stock
Compensation Plan, 2012 Stock Compensation Plan, 2001 Stock Option Plan for
Non-Employee Directors and MSPP (the " _Company Stock Plans_ ") that is
outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether or not vested or exercisable, shall become fully vested and
exercisable as of the Effective Time, (ii) the Company shall cancel each
Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised, as of the Effective
Time (in each case, without the creation of additional liability to the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries), subject, if applicable, to the payment
pursuant to _Section 2.04(b)_, (iii) each award outstanding under the MSPP
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _MSPP Award_ ") shall
become fully vested as of the Effective Time and (iv) each performance-based
restricted stock unit (each, a " _Performance Stock Unit_ ") that is subject
to a Restricted Stock Unit award granted under the Company Stock Plans and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully
vested and be deemed earned in the number of Performance Stock Units equal to
the greater of (A) the "Target Number" (as specified in the applicable award
agreement) of Performance Stock Units or (B) the number of Performance Stock
Units that would have been earned by applying the performance criteria
specified in the applicable award agreement to the Companys actual
performance from the beginning of the "Performance Period" (as specified in
the applicable award agreement) to the Effective Time.

(b) Each holder of a Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised
as of the Effective Time and has an exercise price per Share that is less
than the Merger Consideration shall (subject to the provisions of this
_Section 2.04_) be paid by the Surviving Company no later than ten (10)
calendar days following the Closing (or any later date required to avoid any
penalty Tax under Section 409A of the Code), in exchange for the cancellation
of such Company Stock Option, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i)
the amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the applicable exercise
price per Share of such Company Stock Option, and (ii) the aggregate number of
Shares issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option. All such payments
shall be subject to all applicable federal, state and local Tax withholding
requirements.

(c) Each (i) MSPP Award, (ii) Performance Stock Unit that vests in accordance
with  _Section 2.04(a)_ and (iii) time-based restricted stock unit that is
subject to a Restricted Stock Unit award granted under the Company Stock Plans
and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "
_Restricted Stock Unit_ ") that is vested in accordance with its terms as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time or becomes vested in accordance with
its terms solely as a result of the consummation of the Transaction (each,
a " _Vested RSU_ ") shall be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive, no later than ten (10) calendar days following the Closing (or any

the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall use its
reasonable efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to
the Companys shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
date on which the Company learns that the Proxy Statement will not be
reviewed, or that the SEC staff has no further comments thereon. The Company
shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with a copy of all
material written correspondence between the Company or any

 



30  Company Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the
other hand, with regards to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall give Parent
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy
Statement, including all amendments and supplements thereto, prior to filing
such documents with the SEC or disseminating to holders of Shares and
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all responses to requests for
additional information and shall give due consideration to all reasonable
changes suggested by Parent. If, at any time prior to the Company
Shareholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any
of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by
the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company.

 

(b) Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01_, the
Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date on which
the Company learns that the Proxy Statement will not be reviewed or that the
SEC staff has no further comments thereon, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, (i) if on a date for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is
scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of Shares to constitute a quorum and to obtain the Company
Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall,
after consultation with Parent, have the right to, and (ii) the Company shall,
at any time, upon the written direction of Parent, in either case, make one or
more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Shareholders
Meeting; _provided_ that the Company Shareholders Meeting is not postponed or
adjourned to a date that is more than 30 calendar days after the date for
which the Company Shareholders Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding
any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law). The Company
shall, unless there has been an Adverse Recommendation Change, use its
reasonable efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement, and to take all other actions necessary or
advisable to secure the Company Shareholder Approval.

 

SECTION 6.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable Law, the terms of any
Contract entered into prior to the date hereof or as would be reasonably
expected to violate or result in the loss of any attorney-client (or other
legal) privilege, during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall (and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries to), at Parents expense: (i) provide
to Parent and to the officers, directors, employees, accountants,
consultants, legal counsel, agents and other representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") of Parent reasonable access, during normal business hours
and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company by Parent, to the officers,
employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof, and (ii)
furnish as promptly as practicable to Parent such information concerning the
business, properties, Contracts, assets,

 



31  liabilities, personnel and other aspects of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as Parent or its Representatives may reasonably request;
_provided_ , that if such access or disclosure (x) is prohibited by
applicable Law, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to provide such
access or disclosure in a manner that does not violate Law, (y) is prohibited
by an existing Contract, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
obtain the required consent from the counterparty to such Contract to allow
such access or disclosure or (z) would result in a loss of such privilege, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access
or disclosure (or as much or it as possible) in a manner that would not
result in a loss of such privilege, including to the extent requested by
Parent and if applicable, by entering into a customary joint defense agreement
that would alleviate such loss of privilege.

(b) All information obtained by Parent, Merger Sub or its or their
Representatives pursuant to this  _Section 6.02_ shall be kept confidential
in accordance with the confidentiality agreement, dated April 21, 2015 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between Parent and the Company.

 

(c) No investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.

SECTION 6.03 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall
instruct (and use its reasonable best efforts to cause) the Company
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
solicitation, discussions or negotiations with any person that may be ongoing
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry, proposal or offer
that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and
shall request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished to any person in connection therewith and immediately
terminate all physical and electronic dataroom access previously granted to
any such person, its Subsidiaries or representatives.

(b) Except as permitted by this  _Section 6.03_, during the Pre-Closing
Period, the Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause each Company
Subsidiary not to, and shall instruct (and use its reasonable best efforts to
cause) the Company Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit or initiate any inquiries or the implementation or submission of any
Acquisition Proposal, or any proposals or offers that would be reasonably
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish
to any person any non-public information in connection with, or for the
purpose of facilitating, any inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute,
or would be reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal except to
notify such person of the existence of this _Section 6.03(b)_, (iii)
otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition
Proposal, or any inquiries, proposals or offers that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) execute or enter into any
Acquisition Agreement; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company may grant a waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality or
standstill agreement, to the extent necessary to allow a confidential
Acquisition Proposal to be made to the Company or the Company Board so long as
the Company promptly notifies Parent of any such waiver, amendment or
release;

 



32   _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to the receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval, nothing contained in this _Section 6.03_ shall prevent
the Company or the Company Board from furnishing information to, or engaging
in negotiations or discussions with, any person that made a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal, which Acquisition Proposal did not result in any
material respect from a breach (or deemed breach) of this  _Section 6.03_,
if, and only if, prior to taking such action (A) the Company Board (1)
determines in good faith (after consultation with its advisors) that such
Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a
Superior Proposal, and (2) determines in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel) that its failure to take such actions would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, (B) the Company provides written notice to Parent of the
determination referenced in _clause (A)_ , and (C) the Company receives from
such person an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. The Company
shall deliver to Parent a copy of any executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement promptly following its execution (which may be redacted with respect
to such persons name or other identifying information).

 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) (i) provide
Parent written notice of (A) the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or (B)
any inquiries, proposals or offers received by, or any discussions or
negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any Company Representatives concerning an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) disclose to Parent the material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal or any such inquiry, offer, proposal or request and (iii) provide
Parent with copies of all written information concerning the Company or
any Company Subsidiary provided or made available by the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any Company Representative to such person to the extent not
previously provided or made available to Parent. The Company will keep Parent
reasonably informed on a reasonably prompt basis (and in any event within 48
hours of any material development) of the status and details (including
material amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry, offer,
proposal or request concerning an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, following a determination by the
Company Board that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, notify
Parent of such determination.

 

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 6.03(e)_, neither the Company nor the
Company Board, as applicable, shall, and neither shall publicly propose to:
(i) withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub,
the Company Recommendation; (ii) approve or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal; (iii) enter into any Acquisition Agreement or (iv) refrain from
recommending against (and reaffirming the Company Recommendation) any
Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer within ten (10)
Business Days after the commencement thereof (any such action, other
than those set forth in the preceding _clause (iii)_ , an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ").

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change, if (i) the Company receives an unsolicited,
written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its advisors) is a Superior Proposal and determines
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its
failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (ii) an Intervening Event
occurs and as a result thereof

 



33  the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that

(i) prior to effecting such an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to
a Superior Proposal, (A) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it
intends to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, (B) the Company has
provided Parent a copy of all proposed definitive agreements (including all
financing documents, if applicable) with respect to such Superior Proposal,
(C) if requested to do so by Parent, for a period of four (4) calendar days
following delivery of such notice, the Company shall have discussed and
negotiated in good faith, and shall have made the Company Representatives
available to discuss and negotiate in good faith, with Parent and its
Representatives, any bona fide proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement; and (D) no earlier than the end of such four
(4) calendar day period, the Company Board (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor) shall have determined in good
faith, after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification
to this Agreement proposed by Parent during such four (4) calendar day period,
that such Superior Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the
failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in connection therewith
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any change to the
financial or other material terms of a proposal that was previously the
subject of a notice hereunder shall require a new notice to the Parent as
provided above, but with respect to any such subsequent notices references
herein to a "four (4) calendar day period" shall be deemed references to
a "two (2) calendar day period")

(ii) prior to effecting such an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to
an Intervening Event, (A) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it
intends to effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change, describing in
reasonable detail the reasons for such Adverse Recommendation Change, (B) if
requested to do so by Parent, for a period of four (4) calendar days
following delivery of such notice, the Company shall have discussed and
negotiated in good faith, and shall have made the Company Representatives
available to discuss and negotiate in good faith, with Parent and its
Representatives any bona fide proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and (C) no earlier than the end of such four (4)
calendar day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith,
after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this
Agreement proposed by Parent during such four (4) calendar day period, that
the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would still be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or from
making any disclosure to the Companys shareholders if the Company Board
determines (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its
failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties

 



34  under applicable Law; _provided_ that, in each case, any Adverse
Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with _Section 6.03(e)_.
For the avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public statement that
describes the Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation
of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not, in and of itself, be deemed
an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(g) Except as set forth in _Section 8.03(d)_ with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, for purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer from any person or
group (other than Parent or Merger Sub) relating to, in a single transaction
or series of related transactions, (1) any direct or indirect acquisition of
(A) more than 20% of the assets (whether based on the fair market value,
revenue generation or net income) of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including in any such case through the
acquisition of one or more Subsidiaries owning such assets, or (B) more than
20% of the outstanding Company Common Stock (or any securities convertible
into, or exchangeable for, such Company Common Stock); (2) any tender offer or
exchange offer, as defined pursuant to the Exchange Act, that if consummated
would result, directly or indirectly, in any person or group (or
the shareholders of any person or group) beneficially owning 20% or more of
the outstanding Company Common Stock; or (3) any merger, consolidation,
business combination, share exchange, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company which would
result in any person or group (or the shareholders of any person or group)
beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of the outstanding
Company Common Stock or 20% of the voting power of the surviving entity in a
merger involving the Company or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the
Company or such surviving entity (or any securities convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities representing such voting power). Whenever the
term "group" is used in this Agreement, it shall have the definition set forth
in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act.

 

(ii) " _Intervening Event_ " means any material event, circumstance, change,
effect, development or condition (other than an Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry, offer or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal) first occurring or arising after the date of this
Agreement that was not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board
as of the date of this Agreement (or if known, the magnitude or material
consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Company
Board as of the date of this Agreement).

 

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
made by any person or group (other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries)
after the date of this Agreement, which Acquisition Proposal did not result in
any material respect from a breach (or deemed breach) of this _Section 6.03_,
that (1) would result in such person or group (or in the case of a direct
merger between such person and the Company, the shareholders of such person)
acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding Shares or
all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (2) is on terms that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its financial advisor
and outside

 



35  legal counsel and after taking into account all the terms and conditions of
the Acquisition Proposal) are more favorable to the Companys shareholders
from a financial point of view than the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby (taking into account any proposed amendment or
modification proposed by Parent pursuant to _Section 6.03(e)(i)_) and (3) the
Company Board determines (after receiving the advice of its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) is reasonably capable of being consummated in
accordance with its terms in a reasonable period of time, taking into account
all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects (including certainty
of closing and certainty of financing) of such proposal.

(h) Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that in the event any
Company Representative or any Company Subsidiary takes any action, on behalf
of the Company, which, if taken by the Company, would constitute a material
breach of this _Section 6.03_, and the Company does not take reasonable
action to seek to cure such breach within three (3) Business Days of the date
on which the Company obtains Knowledge of such breach, then the Company shall
be deemed to be in breach of this _Section 6.03_.

 

SECTION 6.04 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, to the
fullest extent permitted under the NYBCL, honor and fulfill in all respects
the obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under any and all
indemnification agreements between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and
any of their respective present or former directors and officers
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "). In addition, the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Company shall contain provisions no
less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification than are set
forth in the Company Charter or the Company By-Laws, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights
thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were
directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Company shall, jointly and severally, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified
Party against all costs and expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid
in connection with any Action (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out
of or relating to any action or omission in their capacity as an officer,
director, employee, fiduciary or agent, whether occurring on or before the
Effective Time. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, Parent and the
Surviving Company shall, jointly and severally, pay all expenses of each
Indemnified Party in advance of the final disposition of any such Action,
subject to receipt of an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined in accordance with applicable Law that such Indemnified
Party is not entitled to indemnification. In the event of any such Action,
(i) Parent or the Surviving Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Company, promptly after statements
therefor are received, (ii) neither Parent nor the Surviving Company

 



36  shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
pending or threatened Action to which an Indemnified Party is a party (and in
respect of which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Action or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents, and (iii) Parent
and the Surviving Company shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall
be liable for any settlement effected without the Surviving Companys written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); and _provided_ _further_ that, in the event that any claim for
indemnification is asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights
to indemnification in respect of such claim shall continue until the
disposition of such claim. The rights of each Indemnified Party under this
_Section 6.04(b)_ shall be in addition to any rights such person may have
under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or similar organizational
documents) of the Company and the Surviving Company or any of their
Subsidiaries, or under any Law or under any indemnification agreement of any
Indemnified Party with the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(c) The Surviving Company shall either (i) cause to be obtained at the
Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six
(6) years from the Effective Time with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance in amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys
existing policies for claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or
prior to the Effective Time; or (ii) maintain in effect for six (6) years from
the Effective Time, if available, the current directors and officers
liability insurance policies maintained by the Company; _provided_ that the
Surviving Company may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage containing terms and conditions that are not less favorable in the
aggregate with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Company be
required to expend pursuant to this _Section 6.04(c)_ more than an amount per
year equal to 300% of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such
insurance; _provided_ _further_ that in the event of an expiration,
termination or cancellation of such current policies, Parent or the Surviving
Company shall be required to obtain as much coverage as is possible under
substantially similar policies for such maximum annual amount in aggregate
annual premiums.

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of
such consolidation, amalgamation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall succeed
to the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.04_.

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to perform all of the
obligations of the Surviving Company under this _Section 6.04_.

 



37 SECTION 6.05 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) Parent hereby agrees that, for a period commencing upon the Effective Time
and ending on December 31, 2016 (or if shorter, during the period of
employment), Parent shall, or it shall cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries to, (i) provide each employee of the Company and of each of the
Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (each, an " _Employee_ "),
other than any Employee covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement (each, a
" _Union Employee_ ") with at least the same level of base salary that was
provided to each such Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
provide each Employee with a cash incentive compensation opportunity that is
at least equal to that provided to the Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (iii) provide the Employees with employee benefits (other
than equity-based awards and defined benefit or non-qualified arrangements)
that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefits (other
than equity-based awards and defined benefit or non-qualified
arrangements) provided to such Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms, all
Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time that are
applicable to any current or former employees or directors of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, including all severance agreements listed on _Section
3.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, it being understood that the
foregoing shall not limit the right of Parent and its Subsidiaries, including
the Surviving Company, to amend or terminate any Plan in accordance with its
terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) any applicable cash incentive
compensation performance period in effect as of the Closing Date and scheduled
to end after December 31 of the year in which the Closing Date occurs shall
end on December 31 of the year in which the Closing Date occurs, and
any applicable payment thereunder shall be made subject to appropriate
adjustment and pro-ration, and (y) the following performance period shall
begin on January 1 of the immediately following calendar year. With respect to
Union Employees, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries to, honor in accordance with their terms all applicable
Collective Bargaining Agreements as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, it being understood that the foregoing shall not limit the
right of Parent and its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company, to
amend or terminate any Collective Bargaining Agreement in accordance with its
terms.

 

(b) Employees shall receive credit for their service on or prior to the
Effective Time with the Company, any Company Subsidiary and all Affiliates
for all purposes (including, for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to receive benefits, but excluding
benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or post-retirement
medical arrangement) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
established or maintained by Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries under which each Employee may be eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time to the same extent recognized by
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under comparable Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Such plan, program or arrangement
shall credit each such Employee for service accrued or deemed accrued on or
prior to the Effective Time with the Company, any Company Subsidiary and all
Affiliates where service with the Affiliate was credited under a comparable
Plan of the Company prior to the Effective Time

 

(c) During the period commencing on the Closing and ending on December 31 of
the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, each Employee who is
primarily employed in the United States (each, a " _U.S. Employee_ ") shall
continue to be eligible to

 



38  participate in the welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements
maintained by the Company in which such U.S. Employee was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Closing. Beginning on January 1 of the
immediately following calendar year, each U.S. Employee who is then employed
by Parent or the Surviving Company will be enrolled in welfare benefit plans,
programs and arrangements maintained by Parent or the Surviving Company (the
" _Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plans_ "), without regard to any waiting periods,
preexisting condition exclusions, at-work requirements, evidence of
insurability and similar terms and conditions, except to the
extent prohibited under applicable Law or the terms of the applicable
Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plan.

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that consummation
of the Transactions will constitute a change in control of the Company under
the terms of the Companys employee plans, programs, arrangements and
contracts containing provisions triggering payment, vesting or other rights
upon a change in control or similar transaction.

(e) Nothing in this _Section 6.05_ shall be treated as an amendment of, or
undertaking to amend, any benefit plan. The provisions of this _Section 6.05_
are solely for the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and
nothing in this _Section 6.05_, express or implied, shall confer upon any
Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof or any other person,
any rights or remedies.

(f) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, provide Parent with reasonable access to employees of the
Company and related employee files and records, in each case to the extent
reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or appropriate in connection
with post-Closing employment and retention matters.

SECTION 6.06 _Further Action_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use
its reasonable best efforts (subject to compliance with applicable Law) to
promptly take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to promptly do, or cause
to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate
and make effective the Transactions, including (i) promptly obtaining all
authorizations, consents, Orders, approvals, licenses, permits, and waivers of
all Governmental Authorities and officials that may be or become necessary
for the performance of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement, (ii)
cooperating fully with the other party in promptly seeking to obtain all such
authorizations, consents, Orders, approvals, licenses, permits and waivers,
(iii) providing such other information to any Governmental Authority as such
Governmental Authority may lawfully request in connection herewith and (iv)
obtaining all consents, approvals or waivers from third parties that are (A)
necessary to consummate the Transactions or (B) disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
the Company, any Company Subsidiary or Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent
shall be required to make any payments or concessions in connection with the
fulfillment of its obligations this _Section 6.06(a)(iv)_ and that neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall pay any consideration or make
any agreements or commitments in connection with any such necessary consents,
approvals or

 



39  waivers without the prior written consent of Parent. As promptly as
practicable, but in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days, following
the date of this Agreement, each party shall make its respective filing, if
necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions and shall
supply as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter to the appropriate
Governmental Authorities any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Each party hereto agrees to
make as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, its
respective filings and notifications, if any, under any other applicable
Antitrust Law, and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the applicable
Antitrust Law.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertaking of Parent pursuant to
_Section 6.06(a)_, Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, use its and their best efforts, and take any and all steps necessary to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Authority or any other person so as to enable
the parties hereto to consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable,
and in any event prior to the Outside Date, including proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of such of its
and their assets, properties or businesses or of the assets, properties or
businesses to be acquired by Parent pursuant hereto, and entering into such
other arrangements, as are necessary or advisable in order to avoid the entry
of, and the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other Order in
any suit or proceeding by a Governmental Authority or any other person under
Antitrust Laws that would otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or
preventing the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this  _Section 6.06(b)_ or any
other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries be required to agree to (nor shall the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries be permitted to agree unless Parent so directs them (and they
shall, if Parent so directs, agree to, so long as such agreements are
conditioned upon the Closing)), any action, concession or undertaking, unless
such action, concession or undertaking is conditioned on the Closing. In
addition, Parent shall defend through litigation on the merits any claim
asserted in court by any Governmental Authority or any other person under
Antitrust Laws in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated,
any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent
the Closing prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
obligation to litigate in no way limits the obligation of Parent to use, and
cause each of its Subsidiaries to use, its and their best efforts, and to
take any and all steps necessary to eliminate each and every impediment under
any Antitrust Law to consummate the Transactions prior to the Outside Date.

 

(c) Each party shall keep the other parties apprised of the content and status
of any communications with, and communications from, any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Transactions, including promptly notifying the
other parties hereto of any material communication it or any of its Affiliates
receives from any Governmental Authority relating to any review or
investigation of the Transactions under the HSR Act or any other applicable
non-United States Antitrust Laws and shall permit the other parties to review
in advance (and to consider any comments made by the other party in relation
to) any proposed substantive communication by such party to any Governmental
Authority relating to such matters. None of

 



40  the parties to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any substantive
meeting, telephone call or discussion with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any submissions, filings, investigation (including any settlement
of the investigation), litigation or other inquiry relating to the matters
that are the subject of this Agreement unless it consults with the other
parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate
at such meeting, telephone call or discussion. The parties to this Agreement
will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such
information and providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of
any applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act. The parties to
this Agreement shall provide each other with copies of all correspondence,
filings or communications between them or any of their representatives, on the
one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be redacted (i) to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Company, (ii) as necessary
to comply with contractual arrangements and (iii) as necessary to address
reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to the Companys consultation and participation rights described
above, Parent shall have the principal responsibility for devising and
implementing the strategy for obtaining any necessary antitrust, competition
or investment review clearances as promptly as practicable, and in any event
prior to the Outside Date, including in connection with the determination of
any actions to be taken under _Section 6.06(b)_, and shall take the lead in
all meetings and communications with any Governmental Authority in connection
with obtaining any necessary antitrust, competition or investment review
clearances.

(d) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall enter into any agreement, transaction
or any agreement to effect any transaction (including any merger or
acquisition) that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or
materially and adversely affect Parents or Merger Subs ability to: (i)
obtain the timely expiration or termination of the waiting period under the
HSR Act, or the authorizations, consents, Orders and approvals required under
any other applicable Antitrust Law, applicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) avoid the entry of, the commencement of
litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other Order that would materially
delay or prevent the consummation of the Transactions, or (iii) obtain all
authorizations, consents, Orders and approvals of Governmental Authorities
necessary for the consummation of the Transactions in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 6.07 _Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Parent hereby guarantees
the due, prompt and faithful payment, performance and discharge by Merger Sub
of, and the compliance by Merger Sub with, all of the covenants, agreements,
obligations and undertakings of Merger Sub under this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, and covenants and agrees to take
all actions necessary or advisable to ensure such payment, performance and
discharge by Merger Sub hereunder. During the Pre-Closing Period, Merger Sub
shall not, and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to, engage in any activity
of any nature except as provided in or expressly contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



41 SECTION 6.08 _Public Announcements_. Each party shall issue its own initial
press release relating to this Agreement, the text of which shall have been
provided to the other party prior to such issuance. Thereafter, each of Parent
and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release
or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or
any of the Transactions, except to the extent public disclosure is required by
applicable Law or the requirements of the NYSE, in which case the issuing
party shall use its reasonable efforts to consult with the other party before
issuing any press release or making any such public statements, except with
respect to the matters described in _Section 6.03_, _Section 8.01_ and
_Section 8.03_ or in connection with any dispute between the parties
regarding this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , subject to _Section 6.03_
in the case of the Company, each party hereto and their respective controlled
Affiliates may make statements that are not inconsistent with previous press
releases, public disclosures or public statements made by Parent and the
Company in compliance with this _Section 6.08_.

 

SECTION 6.09 _Transfer Taxes_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any sales, transfer, stamp, stock
transfer, value added, use, real property transfer or gains and any similar
Taxes which become payable in connection with the Transactions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each of Parent and the
Surviving Company agrees to assume liability for and pay any sales, transfer,
stamp, stock transfer, value added, use, real property transfer or gains and
any similar Taxes, as well as any transfer, recording, registration and other
fees that may be imposed upon, payable or incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions.

 

SECTION 6.10 _Stock Exchange De-Listing_. Parent shall cause the Companys
securities to be de-listed from NYSE and de-registered under the Exchange Act
as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

SECTION 6.11 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent
reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense (at Parents sole cost
and subject to a joint defense agreement) of any Action brought by the
Companys shareholders or other persons against the Company or any of its
directors, officers or Representatives arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions. Without limiting the preceding sentence, the
Company shall give Parent the right to review and comment on all material
filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with any such
litigation, and the right to consult on the settlement with respect to such
litigation, and the Company will in good faith take such comments into
account, and, no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior
written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such Action and
shall keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed with respect to the status
thereof.

SECTION 6.12 _Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "interested shareholder" or other anti-takeover Law
(including Section 912 of the NYBCL) or any comparable anti-takeover
provisions of the Company Charter or the Company By-Laws or any shareholder
rights plan or similar agreement becomes or is deemed to be applicable to this
Agreement or the Transactions, then the Company Board shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions
contemplated hereby

 



42  may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
hereby and otherwise act to render such Law or Laws or other comparable anti-
takeover provisions or shareholder rights plans inapplicable to the
foregoing.

SECTION 6.13 _Cooperation_. Prior to the Closing, the Company will, and will
cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and will use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Company Representatives to, on a timely basis, provide to Parent all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement,
marketing, syndication and consummation of any financing deemed reasonably
necessary or advisable by Parent in connection with the Transactions (the "
_Financing_ ") ( _provided_ , _however_ , that such requested cooperation does
not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries), including making the senior officers of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries available to the debt financing sources for a
reasonable number of meetings at reasonable times, and providing all
information reasonably requested by such debt financing sources in connection
with such Financing, including to assist in the preparation of any pro forma
financial statements required in connection therewith and/or under SEC rules
applicable to Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement
shall require the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective
Representatives (1) to take any action that would reasonably be expected
to conflict with or violate the Company Charter, the Company By-Laws or any
of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or
equivalent organizational documents) of a Company Subsidiary or any Law or
result in the breach of any material Contract, or (2) to pay any commitment
or similar fee, reimburse any third party expenses, provide any indemnities in
connection with any such Financing prior to the Closing (except to the extent
Parent promptly reimburses (in the case of out-of pocket costs) or provides
the funding (in all other cases) to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
therefor) or incur or assume any liability or obligation in connection with
the Financing prior to the Closing. Parent shall, promptly upon written
request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all out-of-pocket costs
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries in performing their obligations under this  _Section 6.13_, and
indemnify the Company for any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims,
costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries arising therefrom.
All non-public or other confidential information provided by the Company or
any of its Representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.13_ shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except
that Parent shall be permitted to disclose such information to potential
financing sources and to ratings agencies during the syndication and marketing
of any Financing, subject to customary confidentiality undertakings by such
potential financing sources. None of the representations, warranties or
covenants of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed to apply
to, or deemed breached or violated by, any of the actions taken by the Company
or any Company Subsidiary at the request of Parent set forth in this _Section
6.13_.

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 

SECTION 8.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the

shareholders of the Company, as follows (the date of any such termination,
the " _Termination Date_ "):

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 

(b) by either Parent or the Company if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred on or before February 12, 2016 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_
, _however_ , that if on the Outside Date any of the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.01(b)_ (to the extent relating to the matters set forth in
_Section 7.01(c)_) or  _Section 7.01(c)_ shall not have been satisfied but
all other conditions set forth in _Article VII_ shall have been satisfied or
waived or shall then be capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to take
place on such date, then the Outside Date shall be automatically extended to
May 12, 2016; _provided_ _further_ that the right to terminate this

 



45  Agreement under this _Section 8.01(b)_ shall not be available to any party
whose failure to fulfill any agreements and covenants under this Agreement has
been the principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective
Time to occur on or before such date;

(c) by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or
entered any decision, injunction, decree, ruling, Law or Order permanently
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the
Merger and such decision, injunction, decree, ruling, Law or Order shall have
become final and nonappealable, or if there shall be adopted following the
date of execution of this Agreement any Law that makes consummation of the
Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _clause (c)_ has
fulfilled its obligations under _Section 6.06_;

 

(d) by either Parent or the Company if this Agreement shall fail to receive
the Company Shareholder Approval at the Company Shareholders Meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof;

(e) by Parent if (i) the Company Board shall have (A) effected an
Adverse Recommendation Change, (B) failed to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement distributed to the shareholders of the
Company or (C) at any time after public announcement of an Acquisition
Proposal (other than pursuant to a commenced tender offer or exchange offer),
the Company Board shall have failed to reaffirm the Company Recommendation
within five (5) Business Days of receipt of any written request by Parent to
do so, or (ii) the Company or any Company Subsidiary enters into an
Acquisition Agreement;

(f) by the Company, at any time prior to the time at which the Company
receives the Company Shareholder Approval, if the Company Board determines to
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in
accordance with _Section 6.03_;

 

(g) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached any of its representations
or warranties, or failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.02(a)_ or _Section
7.02(b)_ and (ii) is incapable of being cured prior to the Outside Date;
_provided_ , that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.01(g)_ if either Parent or Merger Sub is then in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements hereunder; or

(h) by the Company, if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached any of its
representations or warranties, or failed to perform any of its covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i)
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.03(a)_
or  _Section 7.03(b)_ and (ii) is incapable of being cured prior to the
Outside Date; _provided_ , that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(h)_ if the Company
is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements hereunder.

 



46 SECTION 8.02 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) A terminating party shall provide written notice of termination to the
other party specifying with particularity the reason for such termination,
and any such termination in accordance with _Section 8.01_ shall be effective
immediately upon delivery of such written notice to the other party.

 

(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement by any party as provided in
_Section 8.01_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and of no further
force or effect and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of
any party, except that (i) this _Section 8.02_, _Section 6.02(b)_, _Section
8.03_ and _Article IX_ shall remain in full force and effect and (ii) nothing
herein (including _Section 8.03_) shall relieve any party from liability for
any intentional breach of this Agreement prior to the date of such
termination, in which case the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all
rights and remedies available at law or in equity, including liability for
damages determined taking into account all relevant factors, including the
loss of the benefit of the Transactions, any lost shareholder premium, any
lost synergies, the time value of money, and any benefit to the breaching
party or its shareholders arising from such intentional breach. For purposes
of this Agreement, " _intentional breach_ " shall mean an action or omission
taken or omitted to be taken that the breaching party intentionally takes (or
fails to take) and knows (or should reasonably have known) would, or would
reasonably be expected to, cause a material breach of this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the failure of a party to effect the Closing on or prior
to the second (2nd) Business Day after the later to be satisfied of the
condition set forth in _Section 7.01(a)_ or _Section 7.01(c)_ ( _provided_
that such partys other conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VII_ would
be capable of satisfaction if the Closing were to occur on the date of such
termination) shall be deemed an "intentional breach" of this Agreement.

SECTION 8.03 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) All Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Transactions,
the solicitation of shareholder approvals and all other matters related to
the closing of the Merger shall be paid by the party incurring such Expenses,
whether or not the Merger or any other Transaction is consummated, except as
otherwise set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)
one-half of the filing fees and the cost of printing and mailing the Proxy
Statement shall be paid by each of the Company and Parent, and (ii) one-half
of the filing fees incurred in connection with the filings made pursuant to
the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law shall be paid by each of the Company
and Parent. " _Expenses_ ", as used in this Agreement, shall include all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, investment bankers, financing sources, hedging counterparties,
experts and consultants to a party hereto and its Affiliates) incurred by a
party or on its behalf in connection with or related to the authorization,
preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement.

(b) If this Agreement shall be terminated:

 

(i) by (x) Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)_, _Section
8.01(d)_ or (y) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(g)_, then, if (A) on or
prior to the Termination Date (or, with respect to a termination pursuant to
_Section 8.01(d)_, on or prior to the date of the Company Shareholders
Meeting (including any postponements or adjournments thereof)), an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced,

 



47  disclosed or otherwise made public (and not publicly withdrawn) and (B)
within twelve (12) months of the Termination Date the Company or any Company
Subsidiary enters into an agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
or consummates any Acquisition Proposal (in each case, whether or not such
Acquisition Proposal is the same Acquisition Proposal described in _clause
(A)_ above), then the Company shall pay Parent the amount of $423,194,400.00
(the " _Company Termination Fee_ "), which payment shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds within two Business Days of the
earliest to occur of the entry in the agreement with respect to or the
consummation of any Acquisition Proposal, in each case, as referred to in
_clause (B)_ above; or

(ii) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(e)_ or the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.01(f)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company
Termination Fee.

 

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, in the event this Agreement is terminated by
the Company for any reason at a time when Parent would have had the right to
terminate this Agreement, Parent shall be entitled to receipt of any Company
Termination Fee that would have been (or would have subsequently become)
payable had Parent terminated this Agreement at such time.

 

(c) The Company Termination Fee payable by the Company under _Section
8.03(b)_ shall be paid to Parent or its designee by (or on behalf of) the
Company in immediately available funds (i) concurrently with a termination of
this Agreement by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(e)(ii)_, (ii)
simultaneously with, and as a condition to the effectiveness of,
a termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.01(f)_, and (iii) within two (2) Business Days after a termination of this
Agreement in all other circumstances giving rise to the obligation to make
such payment. The payment to Parent or its designees of the Company
Termination Fee shall, subject always to _Section 8.02(b)(ii)_, be the sole
and exclusive remedy of Parent for any loss suffered by Parent or Merger Sub
as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated to the
extent paid and upon such payment in accordance with this _Section 8.03_, the
Company shall not have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, except as set forth in
_Section 8.02(b)(ii)_.

(d) For purposes of _Section 8.03(b)_, Acquisition Proposal shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in _Section 6.03(g)(i)_, except that references
to 20% in the definition thereof shall be deemed to be references to 50%.

 

(e) The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement, accordingly, if the Company fails to pay when due any
amount pursuant to this _Section 8.03_, then the Company shall (i) reimburse
Parent for all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount
and the enforcement by Parent of its rights under this  _Section 8.03_, and
(ii) pay to Parent interest on such overdue amount from the date such payment
was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as
published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made. Subject to _Section 8.02(b)(ii)_, each of the parties
further acknowledges that the payment of the amounts by the Company specified
in this _Section 8.03_ is 

 



48  not a penalty, but, in each case, is liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such fees are
payable for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event
shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee in connection
with the termination of this Agreement more than once.

SECTION 9.04 _Interpretation and Rules of Construction_. When a reference is
made in this Agreement to an Exhibit, an Article or a Section, such reference
shall be to an Exhibit, an Article or a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents, index of defined terms and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. Documents, materials and information are deemed to have been "made
available" to Parent and Merger Sub, if such documents, materials or
information were available for review by such person and its Representatives
through the electronic data room entitled "Project Poseidon", which is hosted
by Intralinks (https://services.intralinks.com) in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or disclosed in a SEC Report filed and
publicly available, in each case, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
date of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in
the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other
thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if". The definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the
plural forms of such terms. Any agreement, instrument or Law defined or
referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or Law as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented, unless otherwise specifically
indicated. References to a person are also to its successors and permitted
assigns. When calculating the period of time before which, within which or
following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this
Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period
shall be excluded, and if the last day of such period is not a Business Day,
the period shall end on the immediately following Business Day. Unless
otherwise specifically indicated, all references to "dollars" and "$" will be
deemed references to the lawful money of the United States of America. Each
of the parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this
Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by all the parties, and
no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
References to "days" shall mean "calendar days" unless expressly stated
otherwise. When "since" is used in connection with a date, the period covered
thereby shall be inclusive of

 



56  such date. No specific provision, representation or warranty shall limit the
applicability of a more general provision, representation or warranty. It is
the intent of the parties that each representation, warranty, covenant,
condition and agreement contained in this Agreement shall be given full,
separate, and independent effect and that such provisions are cumulative. The
phrase "ordinary course of business" shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "consistent with past practice" whether or not such words actually
follow such phrase. Any reference in this Agreement to a date or time shall be
deemed to be such date or time in the City of New York, New York, U.S.A.,
unless otherwise specified.

SECTION 9.05 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

 

SECTION 9.06 _Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties_. Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company each acknowledges and agrees that, except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement, (a) no
party makes, and has not made, any representations or warranties relating to
itself or its businesses or otherwise in connection with the Transactions,
(b) no person has been authorized by any party to make any representation or
warranty relating to such party or its businesses or otherwise in connection
with the Transactions and, if made, such representation or warranty must
not be relied upon as having been authorized by such party, and (c) any
estimates, projections, predictions, data, financial information, memoranda,
presentations or any other materials or information provided or addressed to
any party or any of its Representatives are not and shall not be deemed to be
or to include representations or warranties unless any such materials or
information is the subject of any representation or warranty set forth in this
Agreement.

 

SECTION 9.07 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, taken together with the
Company Disclosure Schedule and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes
the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

SECTION 9.08 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in
whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto;
_provided_ that Parent and Merger Sub may assign all or any of their rights
and obligations hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent so long as Parent continues to remain liable for all of such
obligations as if no such assignment had occurred. Any purported assignment
without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 



57 SECTION 9.09 _Parties in Interest_. Other than the provisions of _Article II_
 (which, from and after the Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options, Restricted Stock Units
and Performance Stock Units as of the Effective Time to the extent necessary
for such holders to receive the consideration due such holders thereunder)
and _Section 6.04_ (which is for the benefit of the persons covered thereby
and may be enforced by such persons), this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 9.10 _Remedies; Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge and
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each party agrees that, in the
event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant
or obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be
entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether
in law or equity, including monetary damages, except as limited by _Section
8.03_) to (a) an Order of specific performance to enforce the observance and
performance of such covenant or obligation, and (b) an injunction restraining
such breach or threatened breach. In circumstances where Parent or the Company
is obligated to consummate the Merger and the Merger has not been consummated
(other than as a result of the other partys refusal to close in violation of
this Agreement), each of Parent and the Company expressly acknowledges and
agrees that the other party and its shareholders shall have suffered
irreparable harm, that monetary damages will be inadequate to compensate such
other party and its shareholders and that such other party on behalf of itself
and its shareholders shall be entitled to enforce specifically Parents or
the Companys, as the case may be, obligation to consummate the Merger.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, the
parties acknowledge and agree that (x) Parent shall not be entitled to
enforce specifically the obligations of the Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless all of the conditions set
forth in _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.03_ shall have been satisfied or
waived in writing by the Company and (y) the Company shall not be entitled to
enforce specifically the obligations of the Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless all of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_ shall have been
satisfied or waived in writing by Parent. Each party further agrees that no
other party or any other person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post
any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 9.10_, and each party
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. In the event that a party
initiates a proceeding seeking equitable relief pursuant to this _Section
9.10_, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended until such proceeding
is finally resolved.

 

SECTION 9.11 _Governing Law._

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of New York.

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to
enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this

 



58  Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (whether brought by any
party or any of its Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates)
shall be heard and determined exclusively in any New York federal court
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such federal court does not have jurisdiction over such
Action, such Action shall be heard and determined exclusively in any New York
state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York.
Consistent with the preceding sentence, each of the parties hereto hereby (i)
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York for the purpose
of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by either
party hereto; (ii) agrees that service of process will be validly effected by
sending notice in accordance with _Section 9.02_; and (iii) irrevocably
waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any
such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction
of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from
attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum,
that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may not be enforced in or by any
of the above named courts.

SECTION 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH
OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS
APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 9.12_.

 

SECTION 9.13 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at
any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, no amendment may be made that
would reduce the amount or change the type of consideration into which each
Share shall be converted upon consummation of the Merger or that would
otherwise require the approval of the shareholders of the Company under
applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

SECTION 9.14 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other
act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations
and warranties of any other party contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any agreement of any
other party or any condition to its own obligations contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. The failure of any party
to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights.

 



59 SECTION 9.15 _Company Disclosure Schedule_. The parties hereto agree that any
reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be disclosed and incorporated by reference in each other Section of
the Company Disclosure Schedule to which such information reasonably relates
as though fully set forth in such other Section to the extent the
applicability and relevance of such information to such other Section is
reasonably apparent. Certain items and matters may be listed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule for informational purposes only and may not be required
to be listed therein by the terms of this Agreement. In no event shall the
listing of items or matters in the Company Disclosure Schedule be deemed or
interpreted to broaden, or otherwise expand the scope of, the representations
and warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement. The mere inclusion
of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty (x) shall not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material event, circumstance, change,
effect, development or condition or that such item would constitute a Company
Material Adverse Effect and (y) shall not be construed as an admission by the
Company of any non-compliance with, or violation of, any third party rights
(including any intellectual property rights) or any Law or Order of any
Governmental Authority, such disclosures having been made solely for the
purposes of creating exceptions to the representations made herein or of
disclosing any information required to be disclosed under this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, no reference to or disclosure of a possible
breach or violation of any Contract or agreement, Law or Order shall be
construed as an admission or indication that a breach or violation exists or
has actually occurred.

SECTION 9.16 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission or other means of electronic
transmission, such as by electronic mail in "pdf" form) in counterparts, and
by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.
