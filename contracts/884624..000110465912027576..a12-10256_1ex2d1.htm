and Buyer shall, following the Closing through the date that the Final
Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to this Agreement, take all
actions reasonably necessary to maintain and preserve copies of all accounting
books and records, policies and procedures on which each of the determination
of the Estimated Purchase Price and the Closing Statement are based. The
Closing Statement and the resulting calculation of the Purchase Price shall
become final and binding on the parties thirty (30) days following Sellers
receipt thereof, unless Seller gives written notice of its disagreement (a "
_Seller Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Buyer prior to such date; _provided
that_ the Closing Statement and the resulting calculation of the Purchase
Price shall become final and binding upon the parties upon Sellers delivery,
prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) day period, of written notice to
Buyer of its acceptance of the Closing Statement. Any Seller Notice of
Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature and amount of any
disagreement so asserted.

 



 

(c) If the Closing Statement is not prepared and delivered by Buyer within the
seventy-five (75) day period set forth in _Section 2.3(b)_, Seller shall be
entitled (but not obligated) during the sixty (60) day period commencing on
the seventy-sixth (76th) day after the Closing Date to prepare and deliver (at
its own expense) the Closing Statement. In such event, the Closing Statement
and the resulting calculation of the Purchase Price shall become final and
binding on the parties thirty (30) days following Buyers receipt thereof,
unless Buyer gives written notice of its disagreement (a " _Buyer Notice of
Disagreement_ ," and each of a Seller Notice of Disagreement and Buyer Notice
of Disagreement, a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Seller prior to such date.
Any Buyer Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature
and amount of any disagreement so asserted.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) If a timely Notice of Disagreement is delivered by Seller or Buyer, as
applicable, then the Closing Statement (as revised in accordance with this
_Section 2.3(d)_), and the resulting calculation of the Purchase Price, shall
become final and binding upon the parties on the earlier of (i) the date any
and all matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement are finally resolved
in writing by Seller and Buyer and (ii) the date any and all matters specified
in the Notice of Disagreement not resolved by Seller and Buyer are finally
resolved in writing by the Arbiter. The Closing Statement shall be revised to
the extent necessary to reflect any resolution by Seller and Buyer and any
final resolution made by the Arbiter in accordance with this _Section
2.3(d)_. During the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of a
Notice of Disagreement or such longer period as Seller and Buyer may agree in
writing, Seller and Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any
differences which they may have with respect to any matter specified in the
Notice of Disagreement, and all such discussions related thereto shall (unless
otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal
Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule. At the end of such
thirty (30) day period, Seller and Buyer shall submit to the Arbiter (who
shall be acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator) for review and
resolution of any and all matters (but only such matters) which remain in
dispute and which were included in the Notice of Disagreement. Buyer and
Seller shall instruct the Arbiter to make a final determination of the items
included in the Closing Statement (to the extent such amounts are in dispute)
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Buyer and Seller will
cooperate (and Buyer shall cause the Company to cooperate) with the Arbiter
during the term of its engagement. Buyer and Seller shall instruct the Arbiter
not to, assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value
for such item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other
hand, or less than the smallest value for such item assigned by Buyer, on the
one hand, or Seller, on the other hand. Buyer and Seller shall also instruct
the Arbiter to make its determination based solely on presentations by Buyer
and Seller that are in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth
in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review). The
Closing Statement and the resulting calculation of the Purchase Price shall
become final and binding on the parties hereto on the date the Arbiter
delivers its final resolution in writing to Buyer and Seller (which final
resolution shall be requested by the parties to be delivered not more than
thirty (30) days following submission of such disputed matters), and such
resolution by the Arbiter shall not be subject to court review or otherwise
appealable. The fees and expenses of the Arbiter pursuant to this _Section
2.3(d)_ shall be borne by the Company, on the one hand, and Seller, on the
other hand, based upon the percentage which the aggregate portion of the
contested amount awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested
by such party, as determined by the Arbiter. For example, if Seller claims the
Final Purchase Price is $1,000 greater than the amount determined by Buyer,
and Buyer contests only $500 of the amount claimed by Seller, and if the
Arbiter ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Seller $300 of the $500
contested, then the costs and expenses of the Arbiter will be allocated 60%
(i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to the Company and 40% (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to Seller.

 



 

(e) If the Purchase Price as finally determined in accordance with this
_Section 2.3_ (the " _Final Purchase Price_ ") is greater than the Estimated
Purchase Price, then Buyer shall, within five (5) Business Days after the
Closing Statement becomes final and binding in accordance with the terms
hereof, make payment to Seller (to an account or accounts designated by
Seller), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, of an amount equal
to the amount by which the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase
Price, together with interest on such excess at a rate per annum equal to the
Applicable Rate, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed
from the Closing Date to the date of payment. If the Estimated Purchase Price
is greater than the Final Purchase Price, then Seller shall, within five (5)
Business Days after the Closing Statement becomes final and binding in
accordance with the terms hereof, make payment to Buyer (to an account or
accounts designated by Buyer or its designee), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, of an amount equal to the amount by which the Estimated
Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price, together with interest on
such excess at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Rate, calculated on
the basis of the actual number of days elapsed from the Closing Date to the
date of payment.

 



       
 

 



 

2.4 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Buyer or its designee and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be
entitled to withhold and deduct from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Buyer or its designee or the
Company and its Subsidiaries are required by law to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law (provided that any such amounts actually
deducted or withheld shall be timely paid to the appropriate Governmental
Authority at Closing). To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate Tax authority, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding were made.

approvals of Governmental Entities required in connection with the matters
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the

_Required Foreign Filings_ "), and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
early termination of any waiting periods and shall promptly make any further
filings or productions pursuant thereto that may be required or requested by a
Governmental Entity in connection therewith. Buyer shall be responsible for
paying all filing fees required in connection with the HSR filings and the

by the other and may be reasonably required in order to make any filings or
applications required to be made pursuant to this _Section 4.2(a)_.

 



 

(b) Subject to restrictions required by law, the parties will notify each
other promptly upon the receipt of (i) any comments or questions from any

event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
any filing made pursuant to this _Section 4.2_, each party shall promptly
inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing promptly with the
applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement. Without limiting

relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties may,
as they deem advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive

only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without
the advance written consent of the party providing such materials. In
addition, to the extent reasonably practicable, all discussions, telephone
calls, and meetings with a Governmental Entity regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall include representatives of all of the
parties. Subject to applicable law, the parties shall consult and cooperate
with each other in advance in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, and proposals made or submitted

Agreement by or on behalf of any party.

 



 

(c) In the event that a Governmental Entity issues a request for additional
information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act or any other
applicable antitrust law (" _Second Request_ ") in connection with the filings
made in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then both
parties shall make (or cause to be made), as soon as reasonably practicable
and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in
compliance with the Second Request in order to obtain expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting period before the Outside Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, whether or not the transactions contemplated herein are
consummated, Buyer shall

 



      
 

 



 

pay all out-of-pocket fees and expenses related to the Companys, Sellers or
Parents response to a Second Request from a Governmental Entity under
antitrust laws (including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses, and
fees and expenses associated with any consultants, accountants, economists,
document production vendors, or other professionals hired to help the Company,
Seller or Parent respond to the Second Request from a Governmental Entity
under antitrust laws), provided that Buyers obligation to pay such fees and
expenses related to actions taken by the Company, Seller or Parent shall be
conditioned upon Buyer not providing written reasonable objections prior to
the Company, Seller or Parent incurring such fees and expenses. Buyer shall
reimburse the Company, Seller or Parent, as applicable, within thirty (30)
days after receipt of an invoice (with reasonable supporting documentation)
for the same.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall respond to and seek to resolve
as promptly as reasonably practicable any objections asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to any filings made in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, if any filings are
required to be made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the HSR Act or any other applicable antitrust law, Buyer shall

expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act
or any Required Foreign Filing and (ii) resolve any objections asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement raised by any
Governmental Entity, and to prevent the entry of any court order and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order that would prevent, prohibit, restrict, or delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (A) executing
settlements, undertakings, consent decrees, stipulations, or other agreements
with any Governmental Entity, (B) selling, divesting, holding separate,
licensing, or otherwise conveying particular securities or equity interests,
assets or categories of assets or businesses of Buyer, Buyers Affiliates or
ultimate parent entities, or the Company Entities, (C) agreeing to any conduct
provisions or agreeing to sell, divest, hold separate, license, or otherwise
convey any particular securities, equity interests, or assets or categories of

and (D) permitting Seller or any of the Company Entities to sell, divest,
license, or otherwise convey any particular assets or categories of assets or
businesses of any of the Company Entities prior to the Closing. All such
efforts shall be unconditional and shall not be qualified by best efforts and
no actions taken pursuant to this _Section 4.2_ shall be considered for
purposes of determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred.

 



 

(e) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and ultimate parent
entities not to, acquire or agree to acquire, by merging with or into or
consolidating with, or by purchasing a portion of the assets of or equity in,
or by any other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership,
association or other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise
acquire or agree to acquire any assets or equity interests, if the entering
into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of such
acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably be expected to: (i)
impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk
of not obtaining, any consents of any Governmental Entity necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) materially increase the
risk of any Governmental Entity seeking or entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii)
materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on
appeal or otherwise; or (iv) materially delay or prevent the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

to) operate its businesses only in the usual and ordinary course of business

of its Subsidiaries, other than the payment of money. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, prior to the Closing, except as set forth on

shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, the Company shall
not (and Seller shall cause the other Company Entities not to):

 



 

(a) take or omit to take any action that would have required disclosure under
_Section 5.8_ below or that would otherwise result in a breach of any of the

Agreement had such actions been taken or omissions occurred during the period
between December 31, 2011 and the date of this Agreement;

 



 

(b) take any action, or omit to take any action, which act or omission would

practice as described on _Schedule 4.3(c)(iii)_ attached hereto; (iv) enter

with past practice); (vi) enter into any transaction, arrangement or contract

indirectly, the right to direct the control or operations of any of the
Company Entities prior to the Closing, (y) prior to the Closing, subject to
this _Section 4.3_, Seller shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over the
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (z) notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no consent of Buyer
shall be required with respect to any matter set forth in this _Section 4.3_
to the extent the requirement to obtain such consent would, upon written
advice of Sellers counsel, violate any applicable law.

 



 

4.4 _Access_. Except (i) as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, (ii) as
would reasonably be expected to violate the attorney-client privilege of
Parent, Seller or any Company Entity (it being agreed that the Company shall
(and Seller shall cause the other Company Entities to) use their reasonable
efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that does not
cause such violation, prohibition, or

 



      
 

 



 

loss of privilege), or (iii) as would materially and unreasonably interfere
with the business and operations of any of the Company Entities, taken as a
whole, the Company shall (and Seller shall cause the other Company Entities
to), upon reasonable request by Buyer following reasonable advance notice,
afford to Buyer and its accounting, legal and other representatives and
advisors, potential lead financing sources, as well as their respective
officers, employees and other agents, reasonable access during normal business
hours to the books, records, offices and properties of the Company Entities,

entered into by the Company with a non-Affiliate of the Company prior to the
date of this Agreement to the extent the confidentiality provisions of such
agreement prohibit the Company from giving access thereto. The Company shall
report to Buyer, as and when reasonably requested by Buyer, concerning the
status of the operations and finances of the Company Entities. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the independent accountants of Seller or any of the Company

harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants.

notice to the other parties of (i) the occurrence or non occurrence of any
event the occurrence or non occurrence of which results in any of its
representations or warranties contained in _Article V_ or _Article VI_
below, as the case may be, being untrue or inaccurate in any material respect
(or, in the case of any representation or warranty qualified by its terms by
materiality including the words "material" or "Material Adverse Effect", then
untrue or inaccurate in any respect) and (ii) any breach of, or failure to
comply in any material respect with, any covenant hereunder by such party. No

Closing (but no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing), the
Company shall have the right to supplement, modify and/or update the
Disclosure Schedules with respect to matters or developments arising after the
date of this Agreement solely in respect of (A) the last sentence in _Section
5.2_, and (B) _Section 5.12_, if (and only if) such matters or developments
(individually or together with all other breaches or inaccuracies of Sellers
and the Companys representations and warranties) would reasonably be expected
to prevent the satisfaction of the condition set forth in _Section 3.1(a)_ (a

to the contrary, unless Buyer provides a Disclosure Update Termination Notice
within such three (3) Business Day period pursuant to this _Section 4.5_,

under _Section 7.1(f)_ or prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ with respect to
the information disclosed in such Disclosure Update, and Seller and the
Company shall not be deemed to be in breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement hereunder with respect to the information disclosed in
any Disclosure Update.

Company shall cause Parent and their respective directors and officers, and
all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of Parent, not to, and shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective

(i) submit, solicit, initiate or encourage any proposal or offer from

dissolution or recapitalization of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (b)
merger or consolidation involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (c)

securities convertible into or exchangeable for, any such Capital Stock) of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the purchase and sale of
inventory in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice),
or (d) similar transaction or business combination involving the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or their business or assets (each of the foregoing

") or (ii) furnish any information with respect to, assist or participate in
or facilitate in any other manner any effort or attempt by any Person (other

Agreement by all parties and ending at 11:59 p.m. New York time on the twenty-
second (22nd) calendar day after the date hereof (such period, the "
_Unsolicited Offer Period_ "), Seller, the Company or Parent receives from a
Person who is not an Affiliate of Seller (a " _Bidder_ ") a bona fide
Qualifying Proposal that (x) constitutes a Superior Proposal and (y) has not
been solicited or otherwise received as a result of, or in any way relating
to, a breach or violation of _Section 4.6_, then, during the period (but only
so long as such offer or agreement continues to be a Superior Proposal during
such period) beginning on the date on which Seller receives such offer or
agreement from such Bidder (the " _Start Date_ ") and ending at 11:59 p.m. New
York time on the End Date (as defined below) (such period, the " _Negotiation
Period_ "), Seller, the Company and Parent (and all other Persons otherwise
restricted under _Section 4.6_) shall be permitted to (i) provide information
in response to a request therefor from the Bidder who submitted such Superior
Proposal (including ongoing information with respect to the terms and
conditions of any other Bidders), if and only if, prior to providing such
information, Seller and the Company have received from such Bidder a duly and
fully executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ _that_ Seller
and the Company shall immediately make available to Buyer a copy of the offer,
proposal or agreement (together with a summary of all material terms known to
Seller, Parent, any of Parents Subsidiaries (or their respective directors
and officers) but not included in the same) and any material information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Bidder to
the extent such information was not previously made available to Buyer;
_provided_ _further_ _that_ notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 4.7_, Seller and the Company shall not (and Seller and the Company
shall cause their respective directors and officers, and all direct and
indirect Subsidiaries of Parent, not to, and shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective representatives,
managers, employees, security holders, agents and Affiliates not to) provide
any commercially sensitive non-public information to any competitor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the actions contemplated
by this _Section 4.7_, except in a manner consistent with the Companys past
practice in dealing with the disclosure of such information in the context of
considering similar transactions prior to the date of this Agreement, and (ii)
engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Bidder who
has made such Superior Proposal during the Negotiation Period. As used herein,
"End Date" shall mean (i) if Seller receives one offer or agreement that
constitutes a Superior Proposal during the Unsolicited Offer Period, the
twenty-second (22nd) calendar day after the Start Date, and (ii) if Seller
receives more than one offer or agreement that constitutes a Superior Proposal
during the Unsolicited Offer Period, the later of (A) the twenty-second (22nd)
calendar day after the Start Date applicable to the first Bidder to submit a
Superior Proposal during

 



      
 

 



 

the Unsolicited Offer Period or (B) the fifteenth (15th) calendar day after
the Start Date applicable to the last Bidder to submit a Superior Proposal
during the Unsolicited Offer Period.

 



 

(b) If, during the Negotiation Period, (i) a Bidder (the " _Topping Bidder_ ")
delivers to Seller (A) a fully negotiated definitive purchase and sale
agreement (or, if applicable, merger agreement), including all fully
negotiated exhibits and schedules thereto (collectively, the " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ "), and (B) evidence from the Topping Bidder that the
board of directors or other proper governing authority of such Topping Bidder
has approved in all respects the Alternative Acquisition Agreement (a "
_Topping Bidder Approval_ "), such Topping Bidder Approval to be in the form
of a customary secretarys certificate certifying the board or other
appropriate governing body resolutions approving the same); (ii) such
Alternative Acquisition Agreement as of such time constitutes a Superior
Proposal; and (iii) Seller determines in good faith to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_, then Seller shall immediately, but in
any event no later than on 11:59 p.m. New York time on the final day of the
Negotiation Period, deliver written notice to Buyer (the " _Competing Proposal
Notice_ ") which notice must (in order to be a Competing Proposal Notice) (x)
confirm Sellers receipt of the Alternative Acquisition Agreement and the
Topping Bidder Approval; (y) include copies thereof, together with a summary
of all material terms of the Alternative Acquisition Agreement known to
Seller, Parent, any of Parents Subsidiaries (or their respective directors
and officers) but not included in the same; and (z) include a customary
secretarys certificate(s) certifying the resolutions of each of Parents,
Sellers and the Companys board of directors or similar governing body
approving and authorizing the Alternative Acquisition Agreement in all
respects, together with a certificate executed by Parents chief executive
officer stating that that Seller and the Company intend to enter into the
Alternative Acquisition Agreement in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated thereunder in the event
that Buyer does not enter into a Match Right Amendment. If Seller does not
deliver to Buyer a Competing Proposal Notice before the expiration of the
Negotiation Period, then Sellers rights set forth in this _Section 4.7_
(including the right to share information and participate in discussions with
Bidders) and _Section 7.1(e)_ with respect to all Bidders shall automatically
terminate and expire, and, immediately upon expiration of the Negotiation
Period, Seller and the Company shall (and Seller and the Company shall cause
their respective directors and officers, and all direct and indirect
Subsidiaries of Parent, to, and shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to cause their respective representatives, managers,
employees, security holders (other than any Subsidiary of Parent), agents and
Affiliates to) resume compliance with all of the provisions of _Section 4.6_
with respect to all Bidders and its (or their) Affiliates, representatives,
officers, managers, employees, directors and agents as if this _Section 4.7_
were not included in this Agreement. If Seller delivers a permitted Competing
Proposal Notice to Buyer on or before the expiration of the Negotiation
Period, then during the period of three (3) calendar days after such delivery
(any such period, subject to one or more automatic extensions contemplated in
the immediately following sentence, a " _Topping Offer Period_ "), Seller and
the Company shall, and shall cause their respective financial and legal
advisors to, negotiate with Buyer and its representatives, agents and advisors
in good faith (to the extent Buyer desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Alternative Acquisition Agreement would cease to constitute a Superior
Proposal. The Topping Offer Period shall automatically be extended to include
additional three calendar days each time Seller delivers to Buyer a Competing
Proposal Notice during the Topping Offer Period (as determined immediately
prior to Buyers receipt of such Competing Proposal Notice, but after giving
effect to any prior extensions in accordance with this sentence).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Competing
Proposal Notice delivered by Seller shall only be effective if delivered in
accordance with _Section 10.2(iv)_.

 



 

(c) If, during the Topping Offer Period, Buyer submits to Seller in writing a
proposed amendment to this Agreement, which if implemented would cause the
Alternative Acquisition Agreement to cease to be a Superior Proposal (a "
_Match Right Amendment_ "), Seller, the Company and Parent shall be allowed
during the period beginning on the date of Sellers receipt of Buyers
proposed

 



      
 

 



 

Match Right Amendment and ending at 11:59 pm New York Time on the third
calendar day after the date of such receipt by Seller (such period, the "
_Follow-on Topping Offer Period_ ") to (1) notify the Topping Bidder of
Buyers proposal and (2) engage or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with the Topping Bidder concerning a potential Superior Proposal.
If the Topping Bidder fails to deliver an Alternative Acquisition Agreement to
Seller that constitutes a Superior Proposal before the expiration of the
Follow-on Topping Offer Period, then (i) Buyer, Seller and the Company shall
enter into the Match Right Amendment and (ii) Sellers rights set forth in
this _Section 4.7_ (including the right to share information and participate
in discussions with all Bidders) and 7.1(e) shall automatically terminate and
expire, and, immediately upon expiration of the applicable Follow-on Topping
Offer Period, Seller and the Company shall (and Seller and the Company shall
cause their respective directors and officers, and all direct and indirect
Subsidiaries of Parent, to, and shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to cause their respective representatives, managers,
employees, security holders (other than any Subsidiary of Parent), agents and
Affiliates to) resume compliance with all of the provisions of _Section 4.6_
with respect to all Bidders and their respective Affiliates, representatives,
officers, managers, employees, directors and agents as if this _Section 4.7_
were not included in this Agreement. If the Topping Bidder delivers an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement to Seller that constitutes a Superior
Proposal before the expiration of the Follow-on Topping Offer Period, Seller
shall deliver a new Competing Proposal Notice to Buyer, and Seller and the
Company shall comply with the covenants of Seller and the Company applicable
during the Topping Offer Period as set forth in this _Section 4.7_ and if,
prior to the expiration of the Topping Offer Period, Buyer submits to Seller
in writing a new proposed Match Right Amendment, which if implemented would
cause the Alternative Acquisition Agreement to cease to be a Superior
Proposal, Seller and the Company shall comply with their respective covenants
applicable during the Follow-on Topping Offer Period, until such time when
either Buyers or the Topping Bidders rights to submit a Superior Proposal
(or, in the case of Buyer, a proposal to modify this Agreement) have expired
and the final Match Right Amendment has become effective or this Agreement has
terminated in accordance with the terms of _Section 7.1(e)_ and the
provisions of _Section 7.2(b)_.

 



 

(d) If Buyer (x) does not submit to Seller during a Topping Offer Period a
Match Right Amendment, or (y) terminates Buyers Topping Offer Period prior to
its expiration by delivering written notice thereof to Seller, then Seller
shall be permitted, within one Business Day following the expiration or
termination of Buyers Topping Offer Period (" _Termination Deadline_ "), to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Section 7.1(e)_,
concurrently pay the Termination Fee to Buyer or its designee in the manner
described in _Section 7.2(b)_ and immediately thereafter enter into such
Alternative Acquisition Agreement. If Seller fails to terminate this Agreement
on or before the Termination Deadline in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence, then Sellers rights under this _Section 4.7_ (including
the right to share information and participate in discussions with any Bidder)
and under _Section 7.1(e)_ shall automatically terminate and expire, and
Seller and the Company shall (and Seller and the Company shall cause their
respective directors and officers, and all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of
Parent, to, and shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
cause their respective representatives, managers, employees, security holders
(other than any Subsidiary of Parent), agents and Affiliates to) resume
compliance with all of the provisions of _Section 4.6_ with respect to all
Bidders and their respective Affiliates, representatives, officers, managers,
employees, directors and agents as if this _Section 4.7_ were not included in
this Agreement.

 



 

4.8 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Seller and the Company shall and shall cause their Affiliates to use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide such cooperation with Buyer as is
reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with Buyers arrangement of any
financing for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Such cooperation will include using commercially reasonable efforts

financial information and projections and other pertinent information), and
(iii) execute and deliver (on behalf of the Company) any definitive financing
documents as may be reasonably requested by Buyer or any prospective lender to
Buyer and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that (x) nothing in this

materially and unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the
Company Entities, taken as a whole, (y) the execution by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries of any documents in connection with the financing for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to and
conditioned upon the consummation of the Closing and shall not result in any
liability or obligation to Seller, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries until the Closing occurs, and (z) neither Seller nor the Company
nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to incur any out-
of-pocket costs or expenses in connection with the foregoing that is not
required to be reimbursed hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, it is understood and agreed that (i) each of Seller and the

under this _Section 4.8_ whether or not any applicable requested deliverables
are actually obtained or provided, and (ii) the condition set forth in
_Section 3.1(b)_, as applied to Sellers and the Companys obligations under
this _Section 4.8_, shall be deemed satisfied unless Buyers arrangement of

Companys willful and intentional acts that constitute a material breach of
its obligations under this _Section 4.8_.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall reimburse the Company and Seller for reasonable documented
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company, Seller or any of
their Subsidiaries to the extent arising out of or relating to any action

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall make or change any election,

claim or assessment relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
surrender any right to claim a refund of Taxes, consent to any extension or
waiver of the limitation period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or take any other similar
action, or omit to take any action relating to the filing of any Tax Return or
the payment of any Tax; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall
limit the right or ability of Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to seek an extension of, or to extend, the due date for the filing of any Tax
Return; _provided_ ___further_ _that_ , for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this _Section 4.9_ shall limit the right or ability of Seller to take any or

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONCERNING 
THE COMPANY AND SELLER_

 



 

As a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, except as set forth in the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (it being understood and agreed by the parties hereto that
disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or
subsection of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to which the relevance of such
item is reasonably apparent on its face based upon a plain reading of such
exception), Seller and the Company hereby represent and warrant to Buyer that:

 



 

5.1 _Corporate Organization_. The Company is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
California and is qualified or licensed to do business in every jurisdiction
in which its ownership of property or conduct of business requires it to
qualify or be licensed, except were the failure to be so qualified or licensed
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company possesses all requisite corporate power and authority necessary to own
and operate its properties, to carry on its businesses as are now being
conducted and to carry out

 



      
 

 



 

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The copies of the Companys
articles of incorporation and bylaws which have been made available to Buyer
reflect all amendments made thereto at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement and are correct and complete. The Company is not in default under or
in violation of any provision of its articles of incorporation or bylaws.
_Schedule 5.1 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a list all of the
officers and directors of the Company as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

5.2 _Capitalization_. The entire authorized Capital Stock of the Company
consists of 4,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
which 100 shares are issued and outstanding. All of the Capital Stock of the
Company is held beneficially and of record by Seller, free and clear of all
Encumbrances. The Company does not have outstanding any stock or securities
convertible or exchangeable for any shares of its Capital Stock or containing
any profit participation features, nor any rights or options to subscribe for
or to purchase its capital stock or any stock or securities convertible into
or exchangeable for its Capital Stock or any stock appreciation rights or
phantom stock plan. The Company is not subject to any option or obligation
(contingent or otherwise) to repurchase or otherwise acquire or retire any
shares of its Capital Stock or any warrants, options or other rights to
acquire its Capital Stock. The Company has not violated any federal or state
securities laws in connection with the offer, sale or issuance of its Capital
Stock. All of the outstanding shares of the Companys Capital Stock have been
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. There are no bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company outstanding having the

right to vote) on any matters on which any shareholders of the Company may
vote. All outstanding Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including the outstanding amount thereof) is set forth on _Schedule 5.2 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule_.

 



 

5.3 _Authorization; Noncontravention_.

 



 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and all of the
other agreements and instruments contemplated hereby to which the Company or
Seller is a party have been duly authorized by the Company, or Seller, as
applicable, and no other corporate act on the part of the Company, or Seller,
is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The consent or other approval
of Parents shareholders or any other direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent
(other than Seller) is not required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company and Seller and, assuming due execution, authorization and delivery
by Buyer, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company and Seller
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws affecting or relating to creditors rights and remedies generally
and the availability of injunctive relief and other equitable remedies. Each
of the other agreements and instruments contemplated hereby to which the
Company or Seller is a party, when executed and delivered by the Company or
Seller, as applicable, in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, shall
each, assuming due execution, authorization and delivery by the other parties
thereto, constitute a valid and binding obligation of such Person, enforceable
in accordance with its respective terms, subject to the effects of applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws affecting or relating to creditors rights and remedies generally
and the availability of injunctive relief and other equitable remedies. The
assignments, endorsements, stock powers and other instruments of transfer
delivered by Seller to Buyer at the Closing will be sufficient to transfer
Sellers entire interest, legal and beneficial, in the Shares. Seller has, and
on the Closing Date will have, full power and authority to convey good title
to all of the Shares, and upon transfer to Buyer of the certificates
representing such Shares and payment for the Shares at the Closing in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Buyer will receive good and
marketable title to such Shares, free and clear of all Encumbrances.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.3(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_, the execution and delivery by the Company and Seller of this
Agreement and all of the other agreements and instruments contemplated hereby
to which the Company or Seller is a party and the fulfillment of and
compliance with the respective terms hereof and thereof by the Company and
Seller do not and shall not Conflict With (x) the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries charter documents, bylaws or other constituent documents
(including trust instruments), (y) any law, statute, rule or regulation to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Seller is subject, or (z) any
agreement, instrument, license, permit, order, judgment or decree to which the
Company or Seller is subject, except, in the case of clauses (y) and (z), as
would not reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate,
in liability that is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. Other than confidentiality agreements entered into in the ordinary
course of business, letters of intent that have expired or been terminated
(except with respect to confidentiality, governing law and other similar
customarily surviving provisions), neither the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries nor Seller is a party to or bound by any written or oral
agreement or understanding to effect or require a Company Transaction other
than this Agreement, and, as of the date of this Agreement, no such Person is
engaged in any current or ongoing discussions with third parties (other than
with Buyer and its Affiliates, and internal discussions with its own
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, representatives and
advisors) regarding such Company Transactions.

 



 

5.4 _Subsidiaries_. _Schedule 5.4 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_
correctly sets forth the name of each Subsidiary of the Company, the
jurisdiction of its organization and the Persons owning the outstanding
Capital Stock of such Subsidiary. Each Subsidiary is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and possesses all requisite corporate power and authority
necessary to own its properties and to carry on its businesses as are now
being conducted and is qualified or licensed to do business in every
jurisdiction in which its ownership of property or the conduct of business
requires it to qualify or be licensed, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. All of the Capital Stock of each Subsidiary is validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable, and, except as set forth on _Schedule 5.4 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule_, all of the Capital Stock of each Subsidiary
is owned by the Company free and clear of all Encumbrances. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or holds the right to acquire any

Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a list of all of the officers and directors of
each of the Companys Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement. The
copies of each Subsidiarys articles of incorporation and bylaws (or similar
governing documents or operating agreements) which have been made available to
Buyer reflect all amendments made thereto at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement and are correct and complete. Breg Deutschland GmbH does not
hold or use any properties or assets (whether tangible or intangible) that are
used in or useful for the Business.

 



 

5.5 _Financial Statements_. _Schedule 5.5 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_
consists of the unaudited consolidated and consolidating balance sheets of

the equivalent) for the fiscal year then ended;

statements of income and cash flows (or the equivalent) for the three-month
period then ended.

material respects, the consolidated and consolidating financial position of
such entities as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated and
consolidating operating results and cash flows of such entities for the
periods covered thereby in conformity with GAAP consistently applied
throughout the periods covered thereby, subject to the absence of footnote
disclosures and, in the case of clause (iii) of _Section 5.5_, changes
resulting from normal year-end adjustments for recurring accruals (none of
which footnote disclosures or changes would, alone or in the aggregate, be
materially adverse to the business, operations, assets, liabilities, financial
position or condition, operating results, value, cash flow or net worth of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole).

 



 

5.6 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.6 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule_, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has any material obligation or material liability (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent, unliquidated or otherwise, provided, that to the extent not
accrued on the Latest Balance Sheet or in the Closing Statement, only to the
extent of the Companys Knowledge of such obligation or liability or such

ARTICLE VI

 



 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONCERNING BUYER_

 



 

As an inducement to Seller and the Company to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer hereby represents and
warrants to Seller and the Company that:

 



 

6.1 _Organization and Power_. Buyer is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Buyer
has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder.

 



 

6.2 _Authorization_. The execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this
Agreement and all of the other agreements and instruments contemplated hereby
to which Buyer is a party and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by Buyer, and no
other corporate act or proceeding on the part of Buyer, its board of directors
or stockholders is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement and all of the other agreements and instruments
contemplated hereby to which Buyer is a party and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Buyer and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Buyer,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, and each of the other agreements and
instruments contemplated hereby to which Buyer is a party, when executed and
delivered by Buyer in accordance with the terms hereof, shall constitute a
valid and binding obligation of Buyer enforceable with its respective terms.

 



 

6.3 _No Violation_. None of Buyers certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or
any applicable law, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity, or any
agreement, instrument, Permit, or subject to

 



      
 

 



 

any order, writ, injunction or decree to which Buyer is subject or pursuant to
which Buyer is obligated, would be breached or violated by Buyers execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

6.4 _Governmental Authorities and Consents_. Except as required under the HSR
Act, no Permit, consent, approval or authorization of, or declaration to or
filing with, any Governmental Entity or any other Person is required in
connection with the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by
Buyer or the consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

6.5 _Litigation_. There are no Claims pending or, to Buyers knowledge,
threatened against Buyer, at law or in equity, or before or by any
Governmental Entity, which would materially and adversely affect Buyers
performance under this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

6.6 _Insolvency_. As of the Closing (and assuming the Closing occurs), after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (x)
assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by Seller and
the Company in this Agreement in all respects and (y) taking into account
Sellers indemnification obligations (including Sellers timely performance
thereof), Buyer will not (a) be insolvent (either because the financial
condition is such that the sum of its known debts is greater than the fair
value of its assets or because the present fair saleable value of its assets
will be less than the amount required to pay its known probable liability on
its debts as they become absolute and matured), (b) have unreasonably small
capital with which to engage in its business, or (c) have incurred or plan to
incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they become absolute and matured.

 



 

6.7 _Investment Representation_. Buyer is aware that the Shares are not
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be sold
until they have been registered, unless an exemption from such registration is
available. Buyer is acquiring the Shares from Seller for its own account, for
investment purposes only and not with a view to the distribution thereof.

 



 

6.8 _Sufficiency of Funds_. Buyer shall have on the Closing Date sufficient
funds to enable it to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on such
date, including payment of the Purchase Price as set forth in _Article II_
and all fees and expenses of Buyer relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

6.9 _No other Representations or Warranties; No Outside Reliance_.

 



 

(a) Except for the representations and warranties expressly made by Buyer in
this _Article IV_ (including the Schedules hereto), neither Buyer nor any
Affiliate of Buyer makes any express or implied representation or warranty,
whether oral or written, on behalf of or with respect to the business,
finances, operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of
operations, prospects, predictions or any other aspect of Buyer, and Buyer
hereby disclaims (on behalf of Buyer, its Affiliates or any other Person) any
representation or warranty not contained in this _Article VI_ (including, in
each case, _Schedule 6.4_) whether made by or on behalf of Buyer, any
Affiliates of Buyer or any other Person.

 



 

(b) Buyer expressly acknowledges and agrees that (i) the representations and
warranties contained in _Article V_ (including the Seller Disclosure
Schedules) and the other Transaction Documents are the only representations
and warranties Seller and the Company are making regarding the Company
Entities and that Seller and the Company are not making any representations
and warranties with respect to any other information about the Company
Entities provided to Buyer in the course of its due diligence investigation of
the Company Entities; (ii) except as specifically set forth in this Agreement
(including in _Article V and_ the Seller Disclosure Schedules) and the other
Transaction Documents, Seller

 



      
 

 



 

is transferring the Shares and the properties and assets held by the Company
Entities "as is, where is, and with all faults;" (iii) except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article V_ (including
the Seller Disclosure Schedules) and the other Transaction Documents, Buyer is
not relying on any representations or warranties of any kind whatsoever,
whether oral or written, express or implied, arising out of any statute,
regulation or common law right or remedy, or otherwise, from Seller or the
Company or directors, officers, employees, agents, stockholders, affiliates,
consultants, counsel, accountants, investment bankers or representatives of
any of them, as to any matter, concerning the Company Entities or the
properties or assets of the Company Entities, or set forth, contained or
addressed in any due diligence materials (including the completeness thereof).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer expressly acknowledges
and agrees that, except to the extent expressly addressed by _Article V_
(including the Seller Disclosure Schedules) and the other Transaction
Documents, any financial information, projections or other information
contained in any documents or other materials (including documents in the
"virtual data room") or management presentations that have been or are in the
future provided to Buyer or any of its Affiliates, agents, lenders or
representatives are not and will not be deemed to be representations or
warranties of Seller or the Company.

(b) by Buyer, upon written notice to Seller (describing in reasonable detail
the basis therefor), if Seller or the Company has breached or failed to
perform any of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement and which breach or failure to perform would give rise

pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)_ if Buyer is then in breach of this
Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section 3.1_ not
to be satisfied;

 



 

(c) by Seller, upon written notice to Buyer (describing in reasonable detail
the basis therefor), if Buyer has breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this

breach (which breach when determined in respect of Seller for purposes of a
purported termination by Seller shall include any breach by the Company) of
this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Closing to occur prior to such Outside Date; or

 



       
 

 



 

(e) by Seller, upon written notice to Buyer, if (i) during the Unsolicited
Offer Period or, if applicable pursuant to _Section 4.7_, during the Follow-
on Topping Offer Period, Seller has received from a Bidder an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement that constitutes a Superior Proposal, (ii) neither
Seller nor the Company has breached or violated any provision of _Section
4.6_ of this Agreement, (iii) Buyers topping rights set forth in _Section

purported termination pursuant to this _Section 7.1(e)_ that does not meet
all of the requirements set forth in this _Section 7.1(e)_ shall be void and
of no force or effect.

 



 

(f) by Buyer, upon delivery by Buyer of a Disclosure Update Termination Notice
to the Company in accordance with _Section 4.5_.

and Consents), (C) _Section 4.8(b)_ (Financing), (D) _Section 8.5_
(Expenses), (E) _Section 8.6_ (Equitable Remedies), (F) _Section 8.8_
(Confidentiality) and (G) _Article_ X (Miscellaneous) shall survive such
termination indefinitely and (ii) nothing in _Section 7.1_ or this _Section
7.2_ shall be deemed to release any party from any liability for any breach by
such party of the terms and provisions of this Agreement or to impair the
right of any party to compel specific performance by another party of its
obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, if this Agreement is to be terminated by
Seller pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_, Seller shall pay the Termination Fee to

the Closing) sold by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Affiliates at

Seller (or any of its Affiliates) would, but for this proviso, be liable
exceeds, on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to $1,575,000 (the "

shall be liable only for all such Losses as are in excess of the Deductible

clause _(i)_ above (other than with respect to the Fundamental
Representations, for which no such limitation shall apply) shall in no event

ignored for purposes of determining the aggregate amount of Sellers and its
Affiliates liability under this clause (IV)) shall in no event exceed an
aggregate amount equal to the sum of (x) the Purchase Price, plus (y) the
Closing Indebtedness, plus (z) the Transaction Expenses; and (V) Sellers
(including its Affiliates) aggregate liability in respect of any Losses of

Healthcare Program. Nothing in this Agreement (including this _Section
8.2(a)_) shall limit or restrict any of the Buyer Parties right to maintain
or recover any amounts in connection with any action or Claim based upon
fraud. No Buyer Party shall be entitled to recover for a particular claim for
indemnification under clause (i) of this _Section 8.2(a)_ (other than with
respect to the Fundamental Representations for which such limit shall apply)
unless the aggregate amount of such Losses (including any series of related
Losses) equals or exceeds $40,000 (the " _De Minimis Threshold_ "); _provided_
_that_ the De Minimis Threshold shall be a threshold and not a deductible and
therefore Buyer Parties may claim the full amount of any such Losses, subject
to the Deductible Amount and the other terms and conditions of this _Section
8.2_, (including those below $40,000) once the De Minimis Threshold has been
met with respect to such claim.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates, employees, agents,

such Seller Party may suffer, sustain or become subject to arising out

 



      
 

 



 

of or as a result of any breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by Buyer in this Agreement.

 



 

(c) (i) Except as otherwise provided herein and except with respect to
Specified Claims, any indemnification of the Buyer Parties or Seller Parties
pursuant to this _Section 8.2_ shall be effected by wire transfer of
immediately available funds from Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, to an
account designated by the applicable Buyer Party or Seller Party, as the case
may be, within three (3) Business Days after the final determination thereof.
A "final determination" shall exist with respect to a matter (other than any
Specified Claim) in respect of which indemnification is sought pursuant to
this Agreement when (x) the parties to the dispute with respect to such matter
have reached an agreement in writing in respect thereof, (y) a court of
competent jurisdiction shall have entered a final and non-appealable order or
judgment with respect to such matter, or (z) an arbitration or like panel
shall have rendered a final non-appealable determination with respect to any
such matter that the parties have agreed to submit thereto.

 



 

(ii) In connection with any Losses (x) that are paid or payable (whether by
reason of a settlement, other disposition of a Claim or otherwise) to a third
party by any Buyer Party arising out of or as a result of any of the Post-
Closing Cold Therapy Claims or, subject to _Section 8.2(g)_, Pre-Closing Cold
Therapy Claims, or, subject to _Section 8.2(h)_, Pain Care Claims and (y)
resulting from compliance, implementation and performance of a corporate
integrity agreement or similar arrangement entered into in connection with any
Pain Care Claim (collectively, " _Specified Claim Losses_ ", which Specified
Claim Losses, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include any and all reasonable
and documented attorneys fees and expenses incurred by the Buyer Parties in
connection with or otherwise arising out of the Specified Claims, any and all
reasonable and documented amounts paid in investigation or defense of the
Specified Claims, and any and all amounts paid in respect of the resolution of
such Specified Claims (including the settlement of such Specified Claims or
payments relating to any judgments, arbitration awards or any other findings
of liability made by any Governmental Entity (including any court) or
arbitrator or other tribunal), Seller shall promptly (but in any event no
later than ten (10) Business Days after receipt of a Buyer Partys written
request for such payment specifying the amount of such Specified Claim Losses
(and including reasonable and itemized detail regarding all charges and
expenses reflected therein) pay the amount of such Specified Claim Losses to
the Buyer Party requesting such payment, or any other Person specified by a
Buyer Party in such written notice, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by such Buyer Party; provided, however, that
Buyer Parties shall not submit invoices with respect to any attorneys fees
and expenses or other amounts paid in investigation or defense of Specified
Claims more frequently than twice in any calendar month. Seller shall pay the
Specified Claim Losses to Buyer in a manner and at the time described in the
immediately preceding sentence, whether or not Seller disagrees with the
amount of such Specified Claim Losses. In the event that Seller does not pay
the full amount of the Specified Claim Losses as and when required pursuant to
this _Section 8.2(c)(ii)_, Seller shall pay to Buyer (a) as a penalty and not
as liquidated damages, an additional amount equal to 12.00% of the Specified
Claim Losses, which amount shall be payable on the first Business day after
the day on which payment of the Specified Claim Losses was required pursuant
to this _Section 8.2(c)(ii)_ and (b) interest on the unpaid portion of the
Specified Claim Losses, which interest shall accrue at a rate of 12.00% per
annum, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed from the
first Business Day on which payment of the Specified Claim Losses was due to
the date of payment.

 



 

(iii) The amount of the Specified Claim Losses shall be final and binding on
Seller and subject to no further dispute or challenge by Seller, unless,
before or after the payment by

 



      
 

 



 

Seller of such Specified Claim Losses to Buyer, Seller gives written notice of
its disagreement (a " _Notice of Objection_ ") with the amount (or any
portion) of such Specified Claim Losses to which Seller objects within twenty
(20) Business Days after Sellers receipt from a Buyer Party of the applicable
written request for the payment of such Specified Claim Losses. Any Notice of
Objection shall specify in reasonable detail the nature and amount of any
disagreement so asserted. Buyer and Seller shall seek in good faith to
resolve in writing any differences which they may have with respect to any
matter specified in the Notice of Objection, and all such discussions related
thereto shall (unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller) be governed by
Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state
rule. If the parties are unable to resolve any or all of the matters set
forth in the Notice of Objection during the period of twenty (20) days after
Buyers receipt of the Notice of Objection, Seller and Buyer shall submit the
dispute to the Expert for review and resolution (subject to clause (iv) of
this _Section 8.2(c)_) of any and all matters (but only such matters) which
remain in dispute and which were included in the Notice of Objection. Buyer
and Seller shall instruct the Expert to make a final determination of the
items included in Notice of Objection in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Buyer and Seller will cooperate (and Buyer shall cause the Company
to cooperate) with the Expert during the term of its engagement. Buyer and
Seller shall instruct the Expert not to, assign a value to any item in dispute
greater than the greatest value for such item assigned by Buyer, on the one
hand, or Seller, on the other hand, or less than the smallest value for such
item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand. Buyer
and Seller shall also instruct the Expert to make its determination based
solely on presentations by Buyer and Seller that are in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis
of an independent review). For purposes of this _Section 8.2(c)_, the parties
hereto agree that William E. Hartgering, Esq., a JAMS arbitrator, shall be the
initial Expert. Not more frequently than once in any 6 month period, Buyer or
Seller (the " _Requesting Party_ ") upon written notice (" _Request Notice_ ")
to the other party hereto (" _Receiving Party_ ") may request a replacement of
William E. Hartgering, Esq. with one of the arbitrators listed on _Schedule C_
attached hereto. The Requesting Party shall designate in its Request Notice
three individuals from the list of potential experts listed on _Schedule C_ ,
at least one of which shall be from the list of "San Diego Experts" set forth
on _Schedule C_ and one of which shall be from the list of "Dallas Experts"
set forth on _Schedule C_. The Receiving Party shall, within three (3)
Business Days after receipt of the Request Notice, provide written notice to
the Requesting Party of its selection of one individual from the individuals
listed in the Request Notice and the individual so selected by the Receiving
Party shall be the Expert for purposes of this _Section 8.2(c)_ as soon as
such individual acknowledges his or her acceptance of such election, and shall
serve in the capacity of Expert hereunder until a party hereto requests a
replacement of such individual in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 8.2(c)(iii)_. In no event shall either party hereto designate in
any Request Notice an individual who has served as an attorney representing
such party or any of its Affiliates at any time during the prior 10 years.

 



 

(iv) The Expert shall deliver its final resolution in writing to Buyer and
Seller (which final resolution shall be requested by the parties to be
delivered not more than ten (10) days following submission of such disputed
matters), and such resolution by the Expert shall be binding on the parties
and shall not be subject to court review or otherwise appealable, unless Buyer
or Seller commences an action in the state of Delaware and the other party to
such action receives service of process (in each case in accordance with
_Section 10.10_) no later than within 60 days after the date Expert delivers
its final resolution to Seller (in which case such court shall determine the
matter). The fees and expenses of the Expert shall be borne by the Company, on
the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, based upon the inverse of the
percentage which the aggregate portion of the contested amount awarded to each
party bears to the amount actually contested by such party, as determined by
the Expert.

 



       
 

 



 

(v) If pursuant to a final determination of the Expert entered into after
receipt by a Buyer Party of a payment from Seller of any Specified Claim
Losses, it is determined that Buyer was not entitled to receive all or a
portion of the amount paid by Seller in respect of such Specified Claim Losses
(the " _Overpayment Amount_ "), Buyer shall promptly (but in any event no
later than three (3) Business Days after receipt of the applicable final
determination), remit the Overpayment Amount to Seller by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller.

 



 

(vi) Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that (w) it is the express intent
of the parties hereto that the Company shall receive from Seller (and Seller
hereby agrees to transfer to the Company as and when needed) all necessary
funds so that the Company is able to timely pay all Specified Claim Losses and
settlement or judgment amounts awarded in respect of Specified Claims; (x) the
indemnification agreements concerning Specified Claims were a material
inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and perform its obligations
hereunder; (y) with regard to Sellers performance of its indemnification
obligations, time is of the essence; and (z) Buyer relied on Sellers
indemnification agreements set forth herein (including in particular in
respect of timing of Sellers payment of Specified Claim Amounts) in
negotiating, structuring and executing credit agreements (including, financial
covenants set forth therein).

 



 

(d) In connection with any Claim in respect of which any Buyer Party seeks
indemnification from Seller pursuant to this Agreement, Seller and Buyer shall
(and shall cause their Affiliates to) enter into a joint defense agreement,
common interest agreement, non-disclosure agreement or any other similar
agreement which the other may reasonably request from time to time. Except as
otherwise required by law, all indemnification payments under this Section 8.2
shall be deemed adjustments to the Purchase Price.

 



 

(e) Any Person making a claim for indemnification under this _Section 8.2_
(an " _Indemnitee_ ") shall notify the indemnifying party (an " _Indemnitor_
") of such claim in writing promptly after receiving written notice of any
Claim against it (if by a third party), describing the Claim, the amount
thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof; _provided_ _that_
the failure to so notify an Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its
obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnitor has been
prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(f) Except with respect to Specified Claims (which shall be governed by
clauses (g)-(i) below), any Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such Claim giving rise to an Indemnitees claim for indemnification
at such Indemnitors expense, and at its option (subject to the limitations
set forth below) shall be entitled to assume (or continue, as the case may be)
at its expense the defense thereof by appointing reputable counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitee (for which purpose any existing counsel
representing Seller or the Company in a pending matter as of the date hereof
shall be deemed acceptable with respect to such matter and any subsequent
matters of similar magnitude and relating to the same set of facts or issues
of law) to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense; _provided_
_that_ , prior to the Indemnitor assuming control of such defense it shall
first verify to the Indemnitee in writing that such Indemnitor shall be
responsible for all liabilities and obligations relating to such claim for
indemnification if and to the extent (and subject to the dollar and other
limitations and terms and conditions set forth in this _Section 8.2_) it is
ultimately determined such liabilities and obligations are subject to
indemnification by Indemnitor hereunder; and _provided_ , _however_ , that:

 



 

(i) the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such
Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; _provided_ _that_
the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the
Indemnitee (other than any reasonable fees and expenses of such separate
counsel that are incurred prior to the date the Indemnitor assumes control of
such

 



      
 

 



 

defense which, notwithstanding the foregoing, shall be borne by the Indemnitor
only if and to the extent Indemnitor is required to provide indemnification
under this _Section 8.2_ with respect to such matter, and except that the
Indemnitor shall pay all of the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate
counsel if the Indemnitee has been advised by outside counsel that a conflict
of interest is likely to exist between the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee);

 



 

(ii) the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense
(unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Indemnitee) if (1) the claim for
indemnification relates to any criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation; (2) the Claim primarily seeks an injunction or
equitable relief against the Indemnitee; (3) the Indemnitee has been advised
by counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest
between the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee; (4) upon petition by the
Indemnitee, the appropriate Governmental Entity rules that the Indemnitor
failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such Claim; or (5) the
Loss relating to the Claim could reasonably be expected to exceed the maximum
amount that such Indemnitee could then be entitled to recover under the
applicable provisions of this _Section 8.2_, in which cases Indemnitee shall
either assume or continue control of the defense of such Claim and defend it
in good faith or waive the applicable provisions of (1)-(5) with respect to
such matter;

 



 

(iii) if the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such Claim, the
Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee before
entering into any settlement of a Claim or ceasing to defend such Claim if (x)
pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation, injunctive or
other equitable relief, or other restriction or obligation will be imposed
against the Indemnitee or if such settlement does not expressly and
unconditionally release the Indemnitee from all liabilities and obligations
with respect to such Claim, with prejudice; or (y) such Claim involves any
settlement with a Governmental Entity (unless such settlement contains solely
monetary remedies) or requires the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter
into a corporate integrity agreement or similar arrangement providing for non-
monetary relief, penalties or restrictions;

 



 

(iv) if Indemnitor shall not control the defense of any such Claim, the
Indemnitor shall have the right to participate in the defense of such Claim at
its sole cost and expense, but the Indemnitee shall control such defense;
provided, however, that the Indemnitor shall not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnitee hereunder for any settlement entered into or any judgment that was
consented to without the Indemnitors prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonable withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless such
consent has previously been requested and Indemnitor has unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed such consent; and

 



 

(v) any claim for indemnification with respect to Taxes that results in or may
result in any Losses for which indemnification may be claimed from the Seller
under this Agreement shall not be subject to this _Section 8.2(e)_- _(f)_ ,
but shall instead be subject to _Section 9.3_.

 



 

(g) Seller shall defend, and shall control the defense of, all Pre-Closing
Cold Therapy Claims, unless with respect to a particular Pre-Closing Cold
Therapy Claim (x) the Loss relating to such Pre-Closing Cold Therapy Claim
could reasonably be expected to exceed the maximum amount that Buyer Parties
could then be entitled to recover under the applicable provisions of _Section
8.2_ or (y) Seller fails to defend such Pre-Closing Cold Therapy Claim
vigorously and in good faith, in which case Buyer shall be entitled to assume
the defense and control of such Pre-Closing Cold Therapy Claim. In connection
therewith, Seller shall directly pay and be responsible for all defense costs
associated therewith (including attorneys fees and expenses), and shall
directly engage (which engagement shall not in any way bind any Buyer Party
with respect to amounts incurred thereunder) any attorneys, experts or

 



      
 

 



 

investigators hired in connection with such matter. Buyer and the Company
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Pre-Closing Cold
Therapy Claim and to employ counsel of their choice for such purpose;
_provided_ _that_ the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be
borne by Buyer and the Company. Seller shall (and shall instruct counsel
retained for purposes of such defense to) consult with Buyer and obtain
Buyers written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) prior to choosing any defense strategy or practices
that are not consistent in all material respects with Sellers defense
strategy and practices prior to the Closing with respect to such matters.
Seller may enter into any settlement of any Pre-Closing Cold Therapy Claim
upon receipt of the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned (with it being understood that,
without limitation, Buyer shall not be deemed to be unreasonable if such
settlement is not consistent in all material respects with Sellers practices
prior to the Closing). Sellers assumption of control of the defense of any
Pre-Closing Cold Therapy Claim as provided in this _Section 8.2(g)_ shall
constitute acceptance by Seller (by virtue of the execution and delivery of
this Agreement) that such matters constitute a Claim hereunder for which,
subject to the dollar and other limitations and terms and conditions set forth
in this _Section 8.2_, Seller is obligated to indemnify the Buyer Parties
pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(vi).

 



 

(h) Seller shall defend, and shall control the defense of, all Pain Care
Claims, unless with respect to a particular Pain Care Claim (x) the Loss
relating to such Pain Care Claim could reasonably be expected to exceed the
maximum amount that Buyer Parties could then be entitled to recover under the
applicable provisions of _Section 8.2_ or (y) Seller fails to defend such
Pain Care Claim vigorously and in good faith, in which case Buyer shall be
entitled to assume the defense and control of such Pain Care Claim. In
connection therewith, Seller shall directly pay and be responsible for all
defense costs associated therewith (including attorneys fees and expenses),
and shall directly engage (which engagement shall not in any way bind any
Buyer Party with respect to amounts incurred thereunder) any attorneys,
experts or investigators hired in connection with such matter. If Buyer does
not have the right to defend and control the defense of a Pain Care Claim,
Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such
Pain Care Claim and to employ counsel of their choice for such purpose;
_provided_ _that_ the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be
borne by Buyer and the Company, unless such Claim relates to (1) any criminal
and/or civil investigation by any Governmental Entity (other than any
exclusion, debarment or suspension of any Company Entity (other than Breg
Deutschland GmbH) from any Government Health Care Program by any Governmental
Entity), in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate
counsel in an amount not to exceed $50,000 shall be borne by Seller; and (2)
any exclusion, debarment or suspension of any Company Entity (other than Breg
Deutschland GmbH) from any Government Health Care Program by any Governmental
Entity, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate
counsel shall be borne by Seller. To the extent that any Pain Care Claim
relates to any criminal and/or civil investigation by any Governmental Entity,
Seller shall be entitled to appoint reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnitee (for which purpose any existing counsel representing Seller or
the Company in a pending matter as of the date hereof shall be deemed
acceptable with respect to such matter and any subsequent matters of similar
magnitude and relating to the same set of facts or issues of law) to be the
lead counsel in connection with such defense. Seller may enter into any
settlement of any Pain Care Claim without the prior consent of Buyer and the
Company, unless (i) pursuant to or as a result of such settlement, injunctive
or other equitable relief, or any other restriction or obligation, will be
imposed against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) such settlement
does not expressly and unconditionally release the Company and its
Subsidiaries from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Pain
Care Claim, with prejudice; or (iii) such settlement requires the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to enter into a corporate integrity agreement or
similar arrangement, in which case Seller shall not enter into any settlement
of such Pain Care Claim without the prior written consent of Buyer, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Sellers
assumption of control of the defense of any Pain Care Claim as provided in
this _Section 8.2(h)_ shall constitute acceptance by Seller (by virtue of the

 



      
 

 



 

execution and delivery of this Agreement) that such matter constitutes a Claim
hereunder for which, subject to the dollar and other limitations and terms and
conditions set forth in this _Section 8.2_, Seller is obligated to indemnify
the Buyer Parties pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(vii)_.

 



 

(i) Buyer or the Company shall defend in good faith, and shall control the
defense of, all Post-Closing Cold Therapy Claims. In connection therewith,
Seller shall reimburse Buyer or the Company in accordance with the terms of
clauses (c)(ii)-(v) above of this _Section 8.2_. Seller shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such Post-Closing Cold Therapy Claim and to
employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; _provided_ _that_ the fees and
expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by Seller. Buyer and the
Company shall (and shall instruct counsel retained for purposes of such
defense to) consult with Seller and obtain Sellers written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) prior to
choosing any defense strategy or practices that are not consistent in all
material respects with Sellers defense strategy and practices prior to the
Closing with respect to such matters. Buyer and the Company may enter into any
settlement of any Post-Closing Cold Therapy Claim upon receipt of the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned (with it being understood that, without limitation,
Seller shall not be deemed to be unreasonable if such settlement is not
consistent in all material respects with Sellers practices prior to the
Closing). Following the exhaustion of Sellers indemnification obligations
with respect to Post-Closing Cold Therapy Claims because of the cap set forth
in Section 8.2(a)(III), Buyer and the Company shall continue to defend Claims
in respect to Cold Therapy Products in a manner consistent in all material
respects with Sellers practices prior to Closing to the extent that Seller
remains liable for any further indemnification pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)(vi)_.

 



 

(j) (i) Seller shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates not to) make any
claim for indemnification against Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates by reason of the fact that Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller is or was a shareholder, member, director, manager, officer, employee
or agent of the Company or any of its Affiliates or is or was serving at the
request of the Company or any of its Affiliates as a partner, manager,
trustee, director, officer, employee or agent of another entity (whether such
claim is for judgments, damages, penalties, fines, costs, amounts paid in
settlement, losses, expenses or otherwise and whether such claim is pursuant
to any statute, charter document, bylaw, agreement or otherwise) with respect
to any action, suit, proceeding, complaint, claim or demand brought by any of
the Buyer Parties against Seller pursuant to this Agreement or applicable law
or otherwise, and Seller (on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates)
hereby acknowledges and agrees that it shall not have any Claim or right to
contribution or indemnity from the Company or any of its Affiliates with
respect to any amounts paid by it pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.

 



 

(ii) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Transition Services
Agreement and any of the other agreements executed and delivered by Buyer (or
any of its Affiliates) in connection herewith, effective upon the Closing,
Seller (on its own behalf and on behalf of any successors and assigns and
their respective Affiliates) hereby irrevocably waives, releases and forever
discharges the Company and its Subsidiaries, and, except for fraud and willful
misconduct, their respective directors, officers, shareholders (and their
limited partners, managers, employees and investment professionals) and
employees, and their respective successors and assigns (collectively, "
_Released Parties_ "), of and from any and all rights to indemnification,
claims, demands, actions, causes of action, liabilities, damages, expenses,
suits of every kind and obligations to it of any kind or nature whatsoever,
and in any capacity whatsoever, in each case whether absolute or contingent,
liquidated or unliquidated, known or unknown, and whether arising under any
agreement or understanding or otherwise at law or equity which Seller or it
Affiliates may have had at any time heretofore, may have now or may have at
any time hereafter, arising from, relating to, resulting from or in any manner
incidental to

 



      
 

 



 

any and every matter, thing or event whatsoever occurring or failing to occur
at any time in the past up to and including the date of this Agreement and, by
receipt of the consideration to be received by Seller and the Shares to be
received by Buyer at Closing, up to and including the Closing, and Seller
agrees that it shall not (and that it shall cause its Affiliates not to) seek
to recover any amounts in connection therewith or thereunder from any Released
Party. In no event shall any Released Party have any liability whatsoever to
Seller (or any Affiliate of Seller) for breaches of the representations,
warranties, agreements or covenants of Seller or the Company hereunder, and
Seller shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates not to) in any event seek
contribution from any Released Party in respect of any payments required to be
made by Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(k) To the extent that an Indemnitee recognizes Tax Benefits as a result of
any Loss, the Indemnitee shall pay the amount of such Tax Benefits (but not in
excess of the indemnification payment or payments actually received from the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Loss) to the Indemnitor as such Tax
Benefits are actually recognized by the Indemnitee but only if (i) such Tax
Benefit is recognized within three taxable periods after the Closing or (ii)
within 12 months after the end of the taxable year in which a settlement or
disposition between Indemnitee and a third party in respect of such Loss was
entered into. For this purpose, the Indemnitee shall be deemed to recognize a
tax benefit (" _Tax Benefit_ ") with respect to a taxable year if, and to the
extent that, the Indemnitees cumulative liability for Taxes through the end
of such taxable year, calculated by excluding any Tax items attributable to
the Loss from all taxable years, exceeds the Indemnitees actual cumulative
liability for Taxes through the end of such taxable year, calculated by taking
into account any Tax items attributable to the Loss for all taxable years (to
the extent permitted by relevant Tax law and not already taken into account
for a previous taxable year pursuant to this _Section 8.2(k)_ and treating
such Tax items as the last items claimed for any taxable year).

 



 

(l) The Losses of an Indemnitee shall be adjusted to give credit for any
insurance recovery (other than any such recovery in respect of Post-Closing
Policies) actually received with respect to the matter to which the claim for
indemnification relates, net of deductibles paid and the portion of any
increase in premiums, costs of collection and/or retro-premiums resulting from
such matter as determined in good faith by an insurance broker acceptable to
both the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee (the " _Neutral Broker_ "). If such
insurance recovery (other than any such recovery in respect of Post-Closing
Policies) occurs subsequent to indemnification being provided by an
Indemnitor, then such Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitor for
any adjustment provided for in the foregoing sentence. In connection with the
foregoing, Indemnitees shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect
such insurance proceeds (other than in respect of Post-Closing Policies) to
the extent that the anticipated insurance proceeds exceed the applicable
deductible and the resulting anticipated premium increases (as the Indemnitee
and Indemnitor are advised by the Neutral Broker). For purposes of this
section, "Post-Closing Policies" shall mean insurance contracts entered into
by Buyer or the Company at or after the Closing in respect of and/or in
connection with Cold Therapy Products sold after the Closing.

 



 

(m) If (x) Seller has made a payment to a Buyer Party in respect of a
particular claim for indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ of this
Agreement, and (y) Buyer or the Company has or obtains actual knowledge that
it is contractually entitled to recover (whether by payment, discount, credit,
relief or otherwise) from a third party a sum which, if collected, would
compensate a Buyer Party (in whole or in part) (other than with respect to
insurance, which shall be governed by clause (g) above) in respect of the Loss
for which the Buyer Party collected such an indemnity payment from Seller,
then Buyer shall:

 



 

(i) promptly notify Seller of the foregoing;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) take such commercially reasonable efforts, at Sellers sole cost and
expense (which costs and expenses shall be prepaid in full at all times before
Buyer is required to take any action), as Seller may reasonably request to
enforce such right; provided, however, that Buyer shall not be required to
take any efforts (including pursuant to clause (i) of this _Section 8.2(m)_)
if, in Buyers reasonable judgment, such step or proceeding (A) would have an
adverse impact on the Company Entities, the Business or any Buyer Party
(including because of relationship damage with current or potential customers,
suppliers, vendors or other third parties), (B) would be reasonably likely to
cause such third party to initiate legal proceedings against any Buyer Party
in respect of any other unrelated Claim or result in negative publicity
involving any such Buyer Party, or (C) would interfere with or distract in any
material respect from the operation of the Business; and provided, further,
that nothing in this clause (ii) shall obligate Buyer to make available its or
any Company Entitys employees for travel or to require its employees to
devote time and attention to any such matter covered hereunder in a manner
that disrupts in any material respect such employees ability to perform its
responsibilities to Buyer or the relevant Company Entity; and

 



 

(iii) pay to Seller, as soon as reasonably practicable after actual receipt
from such third party, an amount equal to the amount actually recovered from
such third party (net of any taxation and all costs of recovery and collection
(to the extent not prepaid in full in compliance with the immediately
preceding clause (ii) above) not to exceed the aggregate amount previously
paid by Seller to a Buyer Party with respect to such claim for
indemnification.

 



 

It is agreed and understood that any third-party (including insurance) net
proceeds actually obtained shall not retroactively reduce the amount of any
Loss for purposes of determining whether Losses have exceeded the Threshold
Amount or any De Minimis Threshold.

 



 

(n) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Indemnitee shall be
entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under any provision of this
Agreement for any amount to the extent such Person or its Affiliate has been
indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any other provision of this
Agreement.

 



 

(o) The remedies provided for in _Section 8.6_ and this _Section 8.2_ shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for any post-Closing claims made for
breach of the representations and warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement, except in the case of fraud. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Indemnitor shall be liable or
otherwise responsible to any Indemnitee under this Section 8.2 for punitive
monetary damages (other than punitive monetary damages awarded to a third
party pursuant to a Claim by a third party or punitive damages in respect of
any Claim under _Section 8.2(a)(vii)_). Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if any pending Claim of a Governmental Entity, or
any future Claim of a Governmental Entity, resulting from, arising out of or
relating to facts, events, actions, omissions or circumstances on or before
the Closing, results in an exclusion, debarment or suspension of any Company
Entity from any Government Health Care Program by any Governmental Entity,
Seller shall indemnify Buyer Parties from and hold them harmless against any
and all Losses of any nature whatsoever relating thereto, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any diminution in value, lost profits and/or any
consequential damages (whether or not reasonably foreseeable) suffered by any
Buyer Parties in connection therewith. Subject to the immediately preceding
sentence, no Indemnitor shall be liable or otherwise responsible to any
Indemnitee under _Section 8.2(a)_ (other than _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_ or
_Section 8.2(a)(iii)_, for which no such limitation shall apply) or _Section
8.2(b)_ (other than with respect to covenants, for which no such limitation
shall apply) for (and the term "Losses" in respect thereof shall expressly
exclude) any consequential damages to the extent that such consequential
damages would not have been reasonably foreseeable by a reasonable Person in
the Indemnitors position, or were remote or speculative, as of the

 



      
 

 



 

date hereof (assuming the breach, occurrence or existence of the applicable
matter specified in or covered by such Sections of this Agreement). In
addition, except in respect of Sellers indemnification of Buyer Parties for
any Losses (i) resulting from, arising out of or relating to any pending or
future Claim of a Governmental Entity that results from, arises out of or
relates to facts, events, actions, omissions or circumstances on or before the
Closing and results in an exclusion, debarment or suspension of any Company
Entity (other than Breg Deutschland GmbH) from any Government Health Care
Program by any Governmental Entity, or (ii) resulting from, arising out of or
relating to any failure of Seller to satisfy and perform its covenants and
agreements with respect to payments under _Section 8.2(c)_ (after (x) notice
thereof from Buyer or the Company in accordance with _Section 10.2_
describing the repayment failure and (y) a three (3) Business Day cure period
following receipt of such notice) (for which, in the case of each of (i) and
(ii), no such limitations shall apply), in no event shall Buyer Parties be
permitted to collect (nor shall Seller be liable) under this Agreement for any
consequential damages resulting from, arising out of or relating to any breach
or inaccuracy in any of Sellers or the Companys representations or
warranties in this Agreement or any matter specified in Sections
8.2(a)(ii)-(ix) to the extent such breach or inaccuracy or other matter
results in a breach or violation of or triggering of rights or obligations
under any current or future debt, credit or similar financing arrangements
(including hedges, swaps or similar arrangements) of or applicable to any
Buyer Party. The limitations in the immediately preceding two sentences shall
not apply to any such damages awarded to a third party pursuant to a Claim by
a third party.

 



 

(p) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, for purposes of
determining whether there has been a breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty contained in _Articles V_ and _VI_ , and for
purposes of determining the amount of any Losses that are the subject matter
of a claim for indemnification hereunder, each representation, warranty and
other provision contained in this Agreement shall be read without regard to
and without giving effect to any "material," "materiality," "Material Adverse
Effect," "in all material respects" standard or qualification contained in
such representation or warranty or other provision (as if such standard or
qualification were deleted from such representation and warranty or other
provision), except for the terms and phrases "Material Contract," "material
fact(s)" and "material to the operation," and with respect to the Non-Scraped
Provisions, each of which shall not be so disregarded or not given effect.

 



 

8.3 _Mutual Assistance_. From and after the Closing, Buyer, the Company and
Seller will mutually cooperate in the expeditious filing of all notices,
reports and other filings with any Governmental Entity required to be
submitted by such Persons in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and/or the other agreements contemplated hereby and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 



 

8.4 _Press Release and Announcements_. Prior to the Closing, the parties
hereto shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public announcement (including, any announcements to
employees, customers, or suppliers) regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and no such press release or public
announcement shall be issued or made prior to the Closing without the prior
written consent of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that if Seller, the
Company or Buyer determine upon advise of outside counsel that a press release
or public announcement is required by applicable law, court process or
pursuant to rules and regulations of any applicable securities exchange, then
Seller, the Company or Buyer (as applicable) may make such required press
release or public announcement without obtaining such consent, in which case
the disclosing party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to consult
with the other party regarding the contents thereof (provided that the
disclosing party shall not be obligated to accept any comments to such press
release or public announcement) prior to issuing any such press release or
making any such public announcement; and provided further that no party shall
be required to obtain consent or provide any such consultation to the extent
that any proposed press release or public announcement consists of information
that has previously

 



      
 

 



 

been made public without breach of the obligations under this Section 8.4. The
parties agree that the initial press releases to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the forms heretofore
agreed to by the parties.

 



 

8.5 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, whether or not
the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, Buyer shall pay all of
its fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation of
this Agreement, the performance of its obligations hereunder and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
are consummated, Seller shall pay all of its and all of the Companys fees,
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation of this
Agreement, the performance of their obligations hereunder and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ _that_ Buyer shall pay all
Transaction Expenses as specifically provided in _Section 2.2(b)(ii)_ (it
being understood that any expenses of Seller or the Company that are not
reflected on _Schedule 8.5_ (and which are therefore not " _Transaction
Expenses_ ") shall be paid by, and shall remain the responsibility of,
Seller). Seller shall update _Schedule 8.5_ as of the Closing, in a manner
that has no adverse effect on Buyer, to reflect all known fees and expenses of
the type to be included thereon as of the Closing. Buyer shall pay all filing
and notification fees in connection with the HSR Act.

 



 

8.6 _Equitable Remedies_. Each of the Company, Seller and Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that the other parties would be damaged irreparably, and that
monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific
terms or is otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Company, Seller and Buyer
agree that the other parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of the provisions of, to enforce
specifically, and to enforce compliance with, this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be
entitled pursuant hereto or at law or in equity.

 



 

8.7 _Further Assurances_. In the event that at any time after the Closing any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto will take such further action (including
the execution and delivery of such further instruments and documents) as any
other party hereto reasonably may request. Each party agrees to reimburse the
other for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with such
requests by the other party.

possession of) Buyer or any of Buyers Affiliates as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) Seller shall, and shall cause its

Affiliates. At the Closing, to the extent permitted pursuant to the relevant
agreement, Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company Entities) shall
assign to Buyer all rights that such entities have pursuant to any
confidentiality, non-disclosure or similar agreements to the extent relating
to any sale process conducted by Seller with respect to the Company Entities.
To the extent that the assignment required pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence is not permitted pursuant to the relevant agreement, Seller
and its Affiliates shall enforce all rights that Seller and its Affiliates
have pursuant to such agreement; _provided_ that, Buyer shall reimburse Seller
promptly for any reasonable documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
Seller and its Affiliates.

 



 

(c) Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the confidentiality obligations set
forth in _Section 8.9(b)_ shall not extend to information, knowledge and data
that (i) is publicly available or becomes publicly available through no act or
omission of the party (or any of its Affiliates or representatives) owing a
duty of confidentiality, or (ii) is required by applicable law to be
disclosed, _provided_ that the party required to make such disclosure shall
promptly inform the other party of any such requirement, disclose no more
information than is so required and cooperate with all attempts by the other
party to obtain a protective order or similar treatment.

8.10 _Cooperation; Attorney-Client Privilege; Conflict Waiver_.

 



 

(a) After the Closing Date, upon Sellers reasonable request (at Sellers
expense) and without necessity of subpoena, Buyer will cause the Company
Entities and their representatives and counsel to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Seller and its Affiliates,
representatives and counsel for purposes of permitting Seller to address and
respond to any matters involving Seller or its Affiliates that arise as a
result of or otherwise related to Sellers or its Affiliates prior ownership
of or affiliation with any of the Company Entities, whether or not related to
this Agreement, including any assets, liabilities or other matters related to
any of the Company Entities that are retained by Seller or its Affiliates and
any claims made by or against Seller or any of its Affiliates, whether
involving any Governmental Entity or other Person.

 



 

(b) After the Closing Date, upon Buyers reasonable request (at Buyers
expense unless any such expense constitutes Losses for which Buyer Parties may
seek indemnification from Seller pursuant to _Section 8.2_) and without
necessity of subpoena, Seller shall (and Seller shall cause its Affiliates and
their respective representatives and counsel to) use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer and the Company Entities and their
respective representatives and counsel for purposes of permitting Buyer or any
of the Company Entities to address and respond to any matters that involve
Buyer or any of the Company Entities that arise as a result of or otherwise
related to Sellers or its Affiliates prior ownership of or affiliation with
any of the Company Entities, whether or not related to this Agreement,
including any claims made by or against any of the Company Entities or any
other Affiliate of Seller, or Buyer or any of its Affiliates, whether
involving any Governmental Entity or other Person.

 



 

(c) Such cooperation under _Sections 8.9(a)_ and _(b)_ shall include (i)
reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice to
the appropriate partys and its Affiliates officers, directors, employees,
auditors, counsel, representatives, properties, books, records and operating
instructions and procedures, (ii) reasonable assistance to the other party in
connection with any actions or

 



      
 

 



 

proceedings, including preparation for any actions or proceedings such as
discovery, depositions and similar activities, and (iii) the right to make and
retain copies of all pertinent documents and records relating to any such
matters; it being understood that nothing herein shall require any party to
waive any attorney-client or work product privilege that may exist. Each
partys obligations under this _Section 8.9_ are in addition to such partys
other obligations contained in this Agreement. Buyer hereby acknowledges that
Seller (or Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent) shall retain originals of any and
all records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries related to any action or
proceeding or potential action or proceeding or liability which is retained by
Seller, or for which Seller has agreed to indemnify Buyer with respect to,
under this Agreement or otherwise. Buyer shall have access to the originals
of such records and Seller shall make one set of copies (at Sellers expense)
if requested by Buyer.

 



 

(d) Within 30 days after Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its counsel
to, transfer to the Company all patent, copyright, and trademark prosecution
files (if any) related to Intellectual Property Rights owned by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (including all work product, samples, search
materials, invention disclosures, work files or similar) and destroy all other
copies thereof that have not been transferred to the Company.

 



 

(e) Within five (5) Business Days after Closing, Seller shall make any
requisite filings to cause the name of Breg Deutschland GmbH to be changed so
as not to include the word "Breg" or any other trademark owned by the Company
after the Closing.

 



 

(f) It is hereby acknowledged by the Parties that Seller has retained Hogan
Lovells US LLP and Hogan Lovells International LLP (collectively, "HL") and
Hyman, Phelps and McNamara, P.C. ("HP") to act as its counsel in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer and the Company
hereby agree that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing
between Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or the Buyer Parties,
on the one hand, and Seller or Parent or any of their respective Affiliates,
on the other hand, each of HL and HP may represent Seller, Parent and their
respective Affiliates in such dispute irrespective of whether HL or HP may be
deemed to have also acted as counsel to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, as
well as with respect to such certain pending litigation matters. The Parties
agree to take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that any privilege
attaching as a result of HLs or HPs engagement and representation in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will
survive the Closing and remain in effect, provided that from and after the
Closing such privilege shall be controlled by Seller and Parent, not the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that a dispute arises between Buyer, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or the Buyer Parties, on the one hand, and a third party other
than Seller or Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, on the other
hand, Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or the Buyer Parties, as
applicable, may assert such attorney-client privilege.

 



 

8.11 _Insurance_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, at its sole cost and
expense, purchase or otherwise acquire tail and/or runoff insurance policies
with respect to products liability and similar claims against or affecting the
Company and its Subsidiaries for actions or omissions prior to the Closing
(the " _Policies_ "). The Policies shall: (i) be written or otherwise provided
by insurers that are reasonably acceptable to Buyer; (ii) provide coverage for
defense costs, settlements, judgments and/or other costs and damages on terms
substantially similar to (or broader than) Sellers and the Companys existing
claims made insurance policies with respect to products liability and similar
claims, (iii) cover the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on
the **** fifth anniversary of the Closing Date; (iv) cover any and all claims
or other matters based on acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing
Date; (v) have a available policy limit of not less than $2 million; and (vi)
include a deductible or self insured retention of not more than $2 million.
In addition, Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain $10
million in additional coverage under the Policies to the extent a tail and/or
runoff policy are available

 



      
 

 



 

within 30 days after the Closing Date on terms materially consistent with
those available under its current policies as of the date hereof. Prior to or
at the Closing, Seller shall provide Buyer with the Policies endorsed to
provide that such Polices shall: (A) name Buyer and the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries as insureds; (B) provide that the indemnification obligations
of Seller pursuant to _Sections 8.2_ (a)(v), _(vi)_ and (vii) hereunder shall
be specifically insured under the contractual liability section of such
Policies; (C) be primary without any right of contribution from any other
insurance carried by Seller or Buyer or their Affiliates; (D) waive any and
all rights of subrogation or set-off that the insurers may or could have
against Buyer and the Company and its Subsidiaries; (E) not be invalidated by
any action or inaction of Seller or its Affiliates and shall insure Buyer and
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries regardless of any breach or violation
of any warranties, declarations, exclusions, or conditions in such polices;
(F) contain a standard severability of interests clause and shall expressly
provide that all the provisions of such Policies, except limits of liability,
shall operate in the same manner as if there were a separate policy covering
each insured; and (G) not be cancelled or materially altered without the prior
written consent of Buyer and the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 



 

8.12 _Certain Covenants_. Seller hereby acknowledges that Seller is familiar
with the Companys and its Subsidiaries confidential or proprietary
information and trade secrets. Seller acknowledges and agrees that Buyer and
the Company and its Subsidiaries would be irreparably damaged if Seller or its
Affiliates were to violate or otherwise breach the terms of this _Section
8.12_. Seller further acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and
agreements set forth in this _Section 8.12_ were a material inducement to
Buyer to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder,
and that Buyer would not obtain the benefit of the bargain set forth in this
Agreement as specifically negotiated by the parties hereto if the provisions
of this _Section 8.12_ are breached. Seller further acknowledges that Seller
(directly or indirectly, through its Affiliated entities) has been
substantially responsible for the growth and development of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and the creation and preservation of the Companys goodwill.

 



 

(a) Therefore, in further consideration of the amounts payable hereunder on
the Closing Date and for other good and valuable consideration, Seller agrees
(on its own behalf and on behalf of Parent and Parents respective
Subsidiaries) that from the Closing Date until the third (3rd) anniversary of
the Closing Date (the " _Restricted Period_ "), Seller shall not (and shall
cause Parent and each of Parents Subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates not
to) directly or indirectly own any interest in, manage, control, participate
in (whether as a partner, agent, representative or otherwise) consult with,
render services for, or in any other manner engage anywhere in the United
States of America or any geographical locale in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries have customers as of the Closing Date, or any other geographical
locale where the Company or any of its Subsidiaries intends to do business or
solicit customers or clients as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, in
any business or enterprise engaged in the manufacture, marketing, management
(including billing or inventory management), distribution or sale of
orthopedic bracing products (including knee, shoulder, elbow, wrist, foot,
ankle and spine orthopedic bracing products (other than EZ Brace and Orthotrac
products manufactured, distributed, or sold by Parent or any of Parents
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof) and soft goods) or orthopedic cold therapy
products (the " _Restricted Business_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
_Section _ _8.12_ shall not operate to prevent or restrict:

 



 

(i) any Person or Persons from acquiring Parent or any of its direct or
indirect Subsidiaries by merger, consolidation, share purchase or purchase of
substantially all of the assets of Parent or any such Subsidiaries where such
Person was not, prior to such acquisition, an Affiliate of Parent;

 



       
 

 



 

(ii) any of Seller, Parent or its or their Subsidiaries or controlled
Affiliates from owning or engaging in any business conducted by any of them on
the Closing Date, other than the Business; and

 



 

(iii) the direct or indirect acquisition by Seller, Parent or its or their
Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates (through acquisition, merger or other
strategic transaction) of an interest in any Person that engages in the
Restricted Business, and

 



 

(A) either (1) such Person does not have consolidated total annual gross
revenues derived from the Restricted Business (at the time of the completion
of such investment or acquisition) in excess of ten percent (10%) of the
consolidated total annual gross revenue of the Companies for the fiscal year
ending prior to the Closing Date or (2) Seller, Parent and its or their
Subsidiaries and its or their controlled Affiliates voting ownership interest
in such Person does not exceed two percent (2%) in the aggregate; or

 



 

(B) Seller, Parent or any of its or their Subsidiaries or any of its or their
controlled Affiliates, as the case may be, promptly following the announcement
of such transaction (and in any event no more than one year after such
announcement), (1) sells the Restricted Business to a third person (with Buyer
having the right to participate, as a potential purchaser of such assets, in
the sale process) that is not an Affiliate of Parent or (2) ceases all
business operations and winds-up the Restricted Business.

 



 

(b) For the duration of the Restricted Period, Seller shall not (and shall
cause Parent and each of its Subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates not to)
directly, or indirectly through another Person, (i) induce or attempt to
induce any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to leave the
employ of the Company or any such Subsidiary or (ii) hire any person who was
an employee or independent contractor of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries at any time during the one-year period immediately prior to the
date on which such hiring would take place (it being conclusively presumed by
the parties hereto so as to avoid any disputes under this Section 8.12(b)(ii)
that any such hiring within such one-year period is also in violation of
Section 8.12(b)(i)). Notwithstanding the forgoing, Seller and Parent and each
of their Subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates may hire any such employees
(x) that are not then sales representatives or members of senior management of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (y) who respond to general
solicitations of employment not specifically directed toward Buyer, the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (it being understood that such
general solicitations shall not be a breach or violation of clause (i) of this
_Section 8.12(b)_.

 



 

(c) If, at the time of enforcement of any of the covenants contained in this
_Section 8.12_ (the " _Restrictive Covenants_ "), a court shall hold that the
duration, scope or area restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under
circumstances then existing, the parties hereto agree that the maximum
duration, scope or area reasonable under such circumstances shall be
substituted for the stated duration, scope or area and that the court shall be
allowed and directed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the
maximum period, scope and area permitted by law. **** Seller acknowledges that
(A) it has consulted with legal counsel regarding the Restrictive Covenants,
(B) the Restrictive Covenants are reasonable in terms of duration, scope and
area restrictions and are necessary to protect the goodwill of the Companys
business and the substantial investment in the Company made by Buyer
hereunder, and (C) the nature of the Companys and its Subsidiaries business
is such that it is not conducted with respect to geographical boundaries.
Seller further acknowledges and agrees that the Restrictive Covenants are
being entered into by Seller in connection with the sale by Seller of the
goodwill of the Companys and its Subsidiaries business pursuant to this
Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) If Seller breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any of the
Restrictive Covenants, the Company, its Subsidiaries and Buyer shall have the
following rights and remedies, each of which shall be independent of the
others and severally enforceable, and each of which is in addition to, and not
in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to the Company, its
Subsidiaries or Buyer at law or in equity: (A) the right and remedy to have
the Restrictive Covenants specifically enforced by any court of competent
jurisdiction, it being agreed that any breach or threatened breach of the
Restrictive Covenants would cause irreparable injury to the Company, its
Subsidiaries and Buyer and that money damages would not provide an adequate
remedy to the Company, its Subsidiaries or Buyer, and (B) the right and
remedy to require Seller to account for and pay over to Buyer or its
Subsidiaries any profits, monies, accruals, increments or other benefits
derived or received by Seller attributable to any transactions constituting a
breach of the Restrictive Covenants.

 



 

8.13 _Employment and Benefits Arrangements_. Prior to the Closing, Seller
shall transfer to the Company the employment of each employee who primarily
performs services for the Business but who is not employed by the Company or
its Subsidiaries and shall take such actions as are necessary to fully vest
all Employees account balances under the Orthofix Deferred Compensation Plan;
provided that the employment of the direct sales representatives employed by
Orthofix Limited (formerly known as Intavent Orthofix Limited) who primarily
sell Breg products shall not be transferred to the Company prior to the
Closing. Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts so that, during
the period commencing at the Closing and ending on first anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Employees who are salaried employees and not subject to any
collective-bargaining agreement (the " _Salaried Employees_ ") will, while
employed by Buyer or its Subsidiaries, be provided with compensation
opportunities and welfare benefits which are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the those (excluding equity-based compensation) provided to such
Salaried Employees as of the date of this Agreement. If permitted under the
terms of each applicable plan, after the Closing, Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any employee benefit plan of Buyer in which
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries (" _Employees_ ") are eligible to
participate to credit, for purposes of eligibility and vesting thereunder
(other than vesting of future equity awards), and for purposes of
determination of levels of benefits for any vacation and severance benefits
(but not for purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit pension or
similar plans), service by the Employees with Seller and the Seller Affiliates
as if such service were with Buyer, to the same extent such service was
credited under a comparable Plan. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, no such crediting of service shall be required to the extent it
would result in a duplication of benefits. As of the Closing, the Employees
shall cease to participate in and accrue benefits under any Plan that is not a
Company Plan. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) constitute or be
deemed an amendment to any Plan or Company Plan or any other compensation or
benefit plan, program or arrangement, (ii) shall alter or limit Buyers, the
Companys or its Subsidiaries ability to amend, modify or terminate any
particular benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (iii) is intended
to confer upon any current or former employee any right to employment or
continued employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or
any right to a particular term or condition of employment, or (iv) is intended
to confer upon any individual (including employees, retirees, or dependents or
beneficiaries of employees or retirees) any right as a third-party beneficiary
of this Agreement.

 



 

8.14 _Dashe Orthopedic Receivable_. The parties agree that following the
Closing, the Company shall pay to Seller, promptly following receipt by the
Company, of all net amounts actually received by the Company from Dashe
Orthopedic Distribution, LLC under the terms of the promissory note dated
March 1, 2012 of Dashe Orthopedic Distribution, LLC payable to the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE IX

 



 

 _TAX MATTERS_

 



 

9.1 _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) Following the Closing, Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
file or caused to be filed (A) any income Tax Returns of an Affiliated Group
of the Seller or its Affiliates that includes the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any Tax period that ends on or before the Closing Date
(regardless of whether such income Tax Returns are filed or required to be
filed before or after the Closing Date) and (B) any stand-alone income Tax
Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any tax period that ends on or
before the Closing Date to the extent the due date of which is after the
Closing Date (the " _Seller Returns_ "). All such Seller Returns shall,
insofar as they pertain to the Company or its Subsidiaries, be prepared in a
manner consistent with prior Tax Returns filed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries except as otherwise required by law. At least thirty (30) days
prior to the due date for the filing of each such Seller Return (taking into
account any extensions), Seller shall provide to Buyer a copy of such Seller
Return or, if such Seller Return includes information pertaining to the Seller
or Affiliates of the Seller other than the Company and its Subsidiaries,
Seller shall provide to Buyer a pro forma "stand-alone" tax return relating
solely the Company and its Subsidiaries (together with a schedule describing
the apportionment of any tax attributes of the consolidated group to the
Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively the " _Apportionment Calculations_
")). For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall Seller be
required to provide Tax Returns to Buyer that include information pertaining
to the Seller or Affiliates of the Seller other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Buyer shall have the right to review and comment on such Seller
Returns and the Apportionment Calculations. Seller shall consider in good
faith any reasonable comments provided by Buyer. Seller shall timely file all
Seller Returns prepared pursuant to this _Section 9.1(a)_.

 



 

(b) Following the Closing, Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
file or cause to be filed any Tax Returns of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are not Seller Returns the due
date of which (taking into account valid extensions of time to file) is after
the Closing Date (the " _Buyer Returns_ "). All such Buyer Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with prior Tax Returns filed by the Company
and its Subsidiaries except as otherwise required by law. Buyer shall provide
Seller with reasonable opportunity to review and comment on each such Buyer
Return prior to filing (and, in the case of an income Tax Return, Buyer shall
provide such Buyer Return to Seller no less than thirty (30) days prior to the
date it is to be filed), and shall make changes to such Buyer Returns
reasonably requested by Seller provided that such changes are not inconsistent
with the standard set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. In the case
of each Buyer Return for a Straddle Period, at the same time that Buyer
provides a copy of such Buyer Return to Seller for Sellers review and
approval pursuant to the provisions of the preceding sentence, Buyer shall
also provide to Seller for Sellers review and approval an allocation of the
Tax for the Straddle Period between the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date and the remaining portion of the Straddle Period,
determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.1(e) (such
allocation the " _Straddle Return Tax Allocation_ "). The Buyer shall timely
file all Buyer Returns prepared pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)_.

 



 

(c) In the event that Seller believes that a change to a Seller Return is not
required under the standard set forth in _Section 9.1(a)_, Buyer believes
that a change to a Buyer Return requested by Seller is not required under the
standard set forth in _Section 9.1(b)_, or in the event that Buyer and Seller
disagree as to the Straddle Return Tax Allocation, such Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve such disagreement. If they fail to resolve
their disagreement within ten (10) days, the matter shall be referred to the
Independent Accountant for its prompt determination, which determination shall
be

 



      
 

 



 

binding upon the Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, the Independent
Accountant shall accept any change to a Seller Return requested by Buyer or
Buyer Return requested by Seller unless, in either case, the Independent
Accountant determines that such request was unreasonable or was inconsistent
with the second sentence of _Section 9.1(a) or (b) as applicable_. The fees
of the Independent Accountant for such determination shall be divided equally
between Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand. The provisions
of this _Section 9.1(c)_ shall not be interpreted as requiring any Tax Return
to be filed in an untimely manner, but, if the determination agreed by Buyer
and Seller or made by the Independent Accountant is agreed or made subsequent
to the filing of the Tax Return to which it relates and is inconsistent with
the Tax Return as filed, an appropriate amended Tax Return shall promptly be
filed.

 



 

(d) Seller shall promptly, to the extent it is required under _Section
8.2(a)_ to indemnify the Buyer Parties, reimburse Buyer for the Tax due with
respect to any Seller Return or Buyer Return.

 



 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement (including, without limitation, _Section
8.2_ and this _Article IX_), Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be allocated
as follows: (i) in the case of any real or personal property Tax, the portion
of such Tax which relates to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period, and the remaining
portion of such Tax shall be allocated to the remaining portion of the
Straddle Period; and (ii) in the case of any other Tax, the portion of such
Tax which relates to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date shall be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the
relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date, and the remaining portion
of such Tax shall be allocated to the remaining portion of the Straddle
Period.

 



 

(f) If necessary to prevent reduction in any Tax Attributes of the Company or
its Subsidiaries under Treasury Regulation §1.1502-36(d), Seller shall make an
election under Treasury Regulation §1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(A) to reduce Sellers
basis in the Shares to their fair market value. If this election is made,
Seller shall timely provide Buyer with a copy of the "Section 1.1502-36
Statement" Seller files with its tax return in connection with the election.

 



 

9.2 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, excise, sales, use, stamp,
filing, recordation, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest with respect thereto) incurred or payable, if any,
resulting directly from the Transaction (the "Transfer Taxes"), shall be borne
50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer, and whichever of Buyer and Seller is primarily
or customarily responsible under applicable local Law for filing such Tax
Returns shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation when due
with respect to all such Transfer Taxes, and such Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the other Party
at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the due date for such Tax Returns. If
required by applicable Law, the other Party shall join in the execution of any
such Tax Returns and other documentation.

 



 

9.3 _Tax Contests_.

 



 

(a) If any claim or demand for Taxes in respect of which indemnity may be
sought pursuant to this Agreement is asserted in writing against Buyer, any of
its Affiliates or, effective upon the Closing, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (a " _Tax Contest_ "), Buyer shall notify Seller of such Tax
Contest within ten (10) days of receipt thereof, or such earlier time that
would allow Seller to timely respond to such claim or demand, and shall give
Seller such information with respect thereto as Seller may reasonably request;
provided, however, that for the sake of clarity, any failure by Buyer to
provide such notice shall not relieve Seller of any liability under this
Agreement unless and to the extent that

 



      
 

 



 

Sellers ability to contest such claim or demand has been prejudiced thereby.
Seller may, at its own expense, participate in such Tax Contest. Furthermore,
Seller may, upon giving notice to Buyer within 10 days after receiving notice
of the Tax Contest, assume the defense of such Tax Contest unless (1) the
claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (2) the Tax
Contest primarily seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Buyer,
the Company or any Subsidiary; (3) the Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries
has been advised by counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict
of interest between the Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and the Seller and its Affiliates, on the other hand; (4) upon petition
by the Buyer, the appropriate Governmental Entity rules that the Seller failed
or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such Tax Contest; or (5) the
Loss relating to the Tax Contest could reasonably be expected to exceed the
maximum amount that such Buyer could then be entitled to recover under
_Section 8.2_; provided that if the Tax Contest is with respect to an
Affiliated Group of the Seller or its Affiliates for a taxable period that
includes the Company or its Subsidiaries, Seller may assume the defense of
such Tax Contest.

 



 

(b) If Seller assumes the defense of such Tax Contest, Seller shall have the
sole discretion as to the conduct of such defense and Buyer shall have the
right to participate (but not the obligation to participate) in the defense
thereof and to employ separate counsel at its own expense. In any event, when
either Buyer or Seller conducts such defense, it shall (a) keep the other
Party promptly and fully informed of the conduct of any such Tax dispute, (b)
provide promptly to the other Party any documents, correspondence, or other
materials relating to any such Tax dispute, and (c) consider in good faith any
reasonable suggestions of the other Party relating to the conduct (including
prosecution, compromise, or settlement) of such Tax dispute. Furthermore, the
Party conducting the defense of any such Tax dispute shall not settle such Tax
dispute in a manner that materially adversely affects the other Party without
the prior written consent of such other Party (which consent shall not be

of their obligations hereunder.

be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable law, such provision shall, subject to _Section
8.12(c)_,

 



      
 

 



 

be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement.

 



 

10.5 _Interpretation_. The headings and captions used in this Agreement or in
the table of contents or in any index hereto are for convenience of reference
only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit, characterize or in any way affect any provision of this Agreement, and
all provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced and construed as if no
caption or heading had been used herein or therein. Any capitalized terms used
in any Schedule or Exhibit attached hereto and not otherwise defined therein
shall have the meanings set forth in this Agreement. Each defined term used in
this Agreement shall have a comparable meaning when used in its plural or
singular form. Unless the express context clearly otherwise requires (a) the
use of the word "including" (or definitions thereof) herein shall mean
"including without limitation", (b) "neither," "nor," "any," "either" and "or"
shall not be exclusive, (c) "hereof," "herein," and "hereunder" and words of
similar import, when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular section of this Agreement, (d) the terms
"Dollars" and "$" mean United States Dollars, (e) references herein to a
specific Section, Subsection or Schedule shall refer, respectively, to
Sections, Subsections or Schedules of this Agreement, (f) references to

words "party" or "parties" when used in this Agreement, shall refer to a party
or the parties to this Agreement, (h) words importing the masculine gender
shall include the feminine and neutral genders and vice versa, (i) the phrases

made available or provided to Buyer and/or its representatives by or on behalf
of Seller or the Company, shall mean documents and materials placed in that
certain virtual dataroom through which the Seller and the Company and their
representatives have provided various documents and materials to Buyer and/or
its representatives throughout the Buyers due diligence review process not
less than two (2) Business Days prior to the date hereof, and (j) the terms
"days" shall mean calendar days. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

10.6 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing herein expressed or implied is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person other than
the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns (and
the Buyer Parties and the Seller Parties), any rights or remedies under or by
reason of this Agreement, such third parties specifically including employees
and creditors of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

10.7 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement and the agreements and documents
attached hereto and delivered hereunder or herewith (including the Water
Street Guaranty) contain the entire agreement and understanding among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings (other than the Confidentiality Agreement and
the Common Interest Agreement) whether written or oral, relating to such
subject matter in any way, including that certain letter agreement, dated
December 20, 2011 between Water Street Healthcare Partners, LLC and Parent as
amended from time to time. Effective as of the Closing, that certain Mutual
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of October 12, 2011, by and between Water
Street Healthcare Partners, LLC and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_
") shall terminate and shall be of no further force or effect (notwithstanding
any provision to the contrary therein).

 



 

10.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 



       
 

 



 

10.9 _Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement and any signed agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or
Internet mail in portable document format or similar format (any such
delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ "), shall be treated in all manner and
respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to
have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto or to any such
agreement or instrument, each other party hereto or thereto shall re execute
original forms hereof or thereof and deliver them (by means other than
Electronic Delivery) to all other parties. No party hereto or to any such
agreement or instrument shall raise (a) the use of Electronic Delivery to
deliver a signature or (b) the fact that any signature or agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of Electronic
Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each such party
forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense related to
lack of authenticity.

 



 

10.10 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement and all disputes, controversies or claims relating to,
arising out of or under, or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the negotiation, execution and
performance hereunder and thereunder, shall be governed by, and construed in

other jurisdiction).

 



 

(b) Subject to the provisions of _Section 2.3_ (which shall govern any dispute
arising thereunder) and _Section 8.2(c)_ , each of the parties hereto

connection with any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby exists in the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware by reason of Section 111 of the DGCL or
if there otherwise exists a good faith basis for concluding that the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware would have subject matter jurisdiction in
connection with any such action, suit, or proceeding, then any such action,
suit, or proceeding shall be brought exclusively in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware, and each party hereto agrees that it shall not attempt
to deny or defeat subject matter jurisdiction over such action, suit, or
proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. Each of the
parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally consents to service being made
through the notice procedures set forth in _Section 10.2_. Each of the
parties hereto hereby agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document by prepaid certified or registered mail to the respective addresses
set forth in _Section 10.2_ shall be effective service of process for any

controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement and any of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit or
prohibit service of process by any other manner as may be permitted by
applicable law. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that this Agreement
involves at least $100,000 and that this Agreement has been entered into in
express reliance on 6 Del. C. § 2708.
