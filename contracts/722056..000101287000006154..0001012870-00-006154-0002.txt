                              AMENDED AND RESTATED

                      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

   This AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (this
"Agreement") is made and entered into as of November 27, 2000 by and among
Rational Software Corporation, a Delaware corporation, ("Parent"), Catapulse
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), Reindeer Acquisition Corporation,
a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"),
Paul Levy and Michael Devlin (together, the "Principal Stockholders"), U.S.
Bank Trust, National Association (the "Escrow Agent") and Paul Levy as the
securityholder agent (the "Securityholder Agent").

                                    RECITALS

   A. The parties hereto entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization
dated November 27, 2000 (the "Original Agreement") which provided for, among
other things, a business combination transaction to be effected by the merger
of the Company with and into Merger Sub, upon the terms and conditions set
forth therein.

   B. The parties desire to amend and restate the Original Agreement to provide
for the business combination transaction contemplated by the Original Agreement
to be effected by a merger of the Company with and into Parent (the "Merger"),
upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, with Parent as the surviving
corporation, and to release Merger Sub from its role and obligations under the
Original Agreement.

   C. The Special Committee of the Board of Directors of Parent and the Board
of Directors of the Company, acting on the recommendation of a special
committee of its Board of Directors, believe it is in the best interests of
each company and their respective stockholders that Parent acquire the Company
through a business combination transaction and, in furtherance thereof, have
approved the Merger.

   D. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, all of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company ("Company Capital Stock") shall be converted into
the right to receive shares of Common Stock of Parent ("Parent Common Stock")
and all outstanding options, warrants or other rights to acquire or receive
shares of Company Capital Stock shall be assumed by Parent and shall become
exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock.

   E. A portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable in
connection with the Merger to the Principal Stockholders shall be placed in
escrow by Parent, the release of which amount shall be contingent upon certain
events and conditions, all as set forth in Article VII hereof.

   F. It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

   G. It is intended by the parties hereto to account for the Merger as a
purchase for financial reporting purposes.

   H. Concurrent with the execution and delivery of the Original Agreement, as
a material inducement to Parent to enter into the Original Agreement Agreement,
the Principal Stockholders and Benchmark (as defined below) executed and
delivered to Parent stockholder support agreements (the "Company Support
Agreements"), substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A.

   I. The Company, the Principal Stockholders, and Parent desire to make
certain representations and warranties and other agreements in connection with
the Merger.

   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, intending to be legally bound hereby the parties hereby amend
and

                                      A-1
<PAGE>

restate the Original Agreement in its entirety to provide as set forth in this
Agreement and hereby agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

   1.1 The Merger.  At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and
subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware Law"), the
Company shall be merged with and into Parent, whereupon the separate existence
of the Company shall cease, and Parent shall continue as the surviving
corporation (sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation").

   1.2 Effective Time. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place as
promptly as practicable, but no later than three (3) business days following
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, at the
offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto,
California, unless another place or time is agreed to in writing by Parent and
the Company. The date upon which the Closing actually occurs is herein referred
to as the "Closing Date." On the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause
the Merger to be consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
in accordance with the relevant provisions of applicable law (the time of
acceptance by the Secretary of State of Delaware of such filing being referred
to herein as the "Effective Time").

   1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective
Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the
Company and Parent shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Parent shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

   1.4 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.

     (a) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time,
  at the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Parent as in
  effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the
  Effective Time, be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
  Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as
  provided in such Certificate of Incorporation.

     (b) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time,
  the Bylaws of Parent as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
  shall, from and after the Effective Time be the Bylaws of the Surviving
  Corporation, until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and
  as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
  Corporation and such Bylaws.

   1.5 Directors and Officers. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to
the Effective Time, the directors of Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold the
office of a director of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the
provisions of Delaware Law and the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until their successors are duly elected and
qualified. The officers of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance
with the provisions of the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

     "Company Convertible Securities" shall mean the Company Options and

     "Company Stockholders" shall mean holders of any shares of Company
  Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time.

     "Escrow Amount" shall mean forty percent (40%) of the aggregate number
  of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to the Principal Stockholders in
  the Merger in exchange for all of the Company Capital Stock held by them or
  their affiliates as of the date of this Agreement, which Escrow Amount
  shall be comprised of a pro rata portion of the vested and unvested shares
  of Parent Common Stock issuable to the Principal Stockholders in the
  Merger.

     "Knowledge" shall mean, with respect to the Company or Parent, what is
  within the actual knowledge of any of the officers or directors of the
  Company or Parent, as the case may be; provided that such officers and
  directors shall have made inquiry of those employees of the Company or

  would have actual knowledge of the relevant matter.

     "Parent Stockholders" shall mean holders of any shares of Parent Common
  Stock.

     "Total Outstanding Shares" shall mean the aggregate number of shares of
  Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
  including the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable,
  with or without the passage of time or satisfaction of other conditions,
  upon exercise or conversion of all Company Convertible Securities and
  Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
  Time; provided, that the Total Outstanding Shares shall not include any and
  all shares of Company Capital Stock held by Parent or the Company or any
  direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary thereof, all of which shall be
  cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time.

     (b) Shares to be Issued; Effect on Capital Stock. The maximum number of
  shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued (including Parent Common Stock
  to be reserved for issuance upon exercise of any of the Company's options
  and warrants to be assumed by Parent) in exchange for the acquisition by
  Parent of all outstanding Company Capital Stock and all unexpired and
  unexercised options, warrants or other rights to acquire Company Capital
  Stock shall be determined immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall
  be equal to the number of Total Outstanding Shares multiplied by the
  Exchange Ratio (as defined below). Subject to the terms and conditions of
  this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
  any action on the part of the Company or the holder of any shares of
  Company Capital Stock, each share of Company Capital Stock issued and
  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
  Dissenting Shares, as defined in Section 1.7 hereof and any shares owned by
  Parent or the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary
  thereof) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.0825 validly
  issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the
  "Exchange Ratio"), assuming the conversion of all Company Preferred Stock
  into Company

                                      A-3
<PAGE>

  Common Stock in accordance with the terms and provisions of Article Fourth,
  Section 3 of the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of
  Incorporation and as provided in this Agreement.

     (c) Assumption of Company Options. At the Effective Time, each
  outstanding Company Option issued pursuant to the Company's 1999 Stock Plan
  (the "Option Plan") or otherwise, whether vested or unvested, will be
  assumed by Parent in connection with the Merger. Subject to Section 5.8,
  each Company Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement shall
  continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set
  forth in the Option Plan and/or as provided in the respective option
  agreements immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, without
  limitation, any vesting schedule or repurchase rights), except that (i)
  each Company Option will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of
  Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company
  Capital Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option
  immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
  rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
  and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock
  issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option will be equal to the
  quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company
  Capital Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately
  prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the
  nearest whole cent. Parent shall take all corporate actions necessary to
  reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock
  for delivery following the exercise of the Company Options assumed by
  Parent.

     (d) Assumption of Company Warrants. Parent shall treat warrants to
  purchase Company Capital Stock as granting the holder thereof an equivalent
  right to purchase or receive for each share of Company Capital Stock
  subject to such warrants immediately prior to the Effective Time, the right
  to receive a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares
  of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "Assumed
  Warrants"). After the Effective Time, the Assumed Warrants shall be
  exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the
  Company Warrants immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i)
  each Assumed Warrant will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of
  Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company
  Capital Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Warrant
  immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
  rounded to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock (with
  .5 being rounded down), and (ii) the per share exercise price for the
  shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Assumed
  Warrant will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise
  price per share of Company Capital Stock at which such Assumed Warrant was
  exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio,
  rounded to the nearest whole cent (with .5 being rounded down). Parent
  shall take all corporate actions necessary to reserve for issuance a
  sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery following
  the exercise of the Assumed Warrants.

     (e) Option Status. It is the intention of the parties hereto that
  Company Options assumed by Parent following the Closing pursuant to this
  Section 1.6, to the extent permitted by applicable law, will qualify as
  incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code, but only to
  the extent any such Company Options qualified as incentive stock options
  immediately prior to the Effective Time.

     (f) Withholding Taxes. Any number of shares of Parent Common Stock
  issuable pursuant to Section 1.6(b) to any holder of Company Options shall
  be subject to, and reduced by, the amount of the applicable minimum
  statutory withholding rates for federal and state tax purposes with respect
  to any state, federal and foreign withholding taxes incurred (and not
  previously paid by or on behalf of the Company or such holder) in
  connection with the acquisition of capital stock by each holder upon the
  exercise of Company Options, or the payment of a bonus, if any.

     (g) Fractional Shares. No fractional share of Parent Common Stock shall
  be issued in the Merger. In lieu thereof, each holder of Company Capital
  Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been
  entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
  taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall
  receive cash (without interest) in an amount equal

                                      A-4
<PAGE>

  to such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the
  Average Stock Price (as defined in Section 7.2(d)(ii)).

     (h) Cancellation of Parent-Owned and Company-Owned Stock. Immediately
  prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
  on the part of any of the parties hereto, each share of Company Capital
  Stock owned by Parent, the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned
  subsidiary thereof immediately prior to the Effective Time, including, but
  not limited to, Company Series A Preferred Stock, shall be cancelled and
  extinguished without any conversion thereof.

   1.7 Dissenting Shares for Holders of Company Capital Stock. Notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Capital
Stock held by a holder who has demanded and perfected dissenters' rights for
such shares in accordance with Delaware Law and who, as of the Effective Time,
has not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights ("Dissenting
Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive Parent
Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6, but the holder thereof shall only be
entitled to such rights as are granted by Delaware Law.

     (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), if any holder of
  shares of Company Capital Stock who demands purchase of such shares under
  Delaware Law shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect
  or otherwise) the right to appraisal, then, as of the later of the
  Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder's shares shall
  automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive
  Parent Common Stock as provided in Section 1.6, without interest thereon,
  upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares.

     (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
  demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Capital Stock, withdrawals
  of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law
  and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
  negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
  Delaware Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
  of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
  appraisal of capital stock of the Company or offer to settle or settle any
  such demands. Parent shall have full recourse to the Escrow Fund (as
  defined in Section 7.2(a)) for the amount, if any, paid by the Company or
  Parent in respect of Dissenting Shares in excess of the consideration that
  otherwise would have been payable in respect of such Dissenting Shares
  pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof if such Dissenting Shares were not the
  subject of an appraisal demand.

   1.8 Surrender of Certificates.

     (a) Exchange Agent. The transfer agent of Parent (or another entity
  reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) shall serve as exchange
  agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger.

     (b) Parent to Provide Parent Common Stock. Prior to the Closing, Parent
  shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with
  this Article I the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to the Company
  Stockholders pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for outstanding shares of
  Company Capital Stock, less the Escrow Amount which Parent shall deposit
  into the Escrow Fund (as defined in Section 7.2(a) hereof) on behalf of the
  Principal Stockholders. The portion of the Escrow Amount contributed on
  behalf of each of the Principal Stockholders shall be in proportion to the
  aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger in
  exchange for all of the shares of Company Capital Stock held by them or
  their affiliates as of the date of this Agreement.

     (c) Exchange Procedures. In connection with the mailing of the Proxy
  Statement (as defined in Section 5.1 below) to the Company Stockholders,
  Parent shall cause to be mailed to each Company Stockholder (i) a letter of
  transmittal (which shall be in such form and contain such provisions as
  Parent may reasonably specify and shall specify that delivery shall be
  effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates (the
  "Certificates") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represent
  outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock whose shares are converted into
  the right to receive such Company Stockholder's portion of the
  consideration pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof, shall pass, only upon
  delivery of

                                      A-5
<PAGE>

  the Certificates to the Exchange Agent at the Closing) and (ii)
  instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
  exchange for certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to
  which such holder is entitled in the Merger. Upon surrender of a
  Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent
  or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
  transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
  instructions thereto, a Company Stockholder shall be entitled to receive,
  and the Exchange Agent shall promptly deliver in exchange therefor, (A) a
  certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
  (less the allocable portion of the Escrow Amount, as applicable) to which
  such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6(b), (B) the amount of cash
  payable, if any, in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to
  which the holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and (C) the amount
  of any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled
  pursuant to Section 1.8(d), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
  forthwith be canceled. Parent shall use reasonable efforts to have
  available at the Closing stock certificates representing the appropriate
  number of shares of Parent Common Stock for each Company Stockholder who
  shall have properly completed such stockholder's letter of transmittal and
  delivered such stockholder's Certificate or Certificates to Parent at least
  five business days prior to the Closing Date. As soon as practicable after
  the Effective Time, and subject to and in accordance with the provisions of
  Article VII hereof, Parent shall cause to be distributed to the Escrow
  Agent (as defined in Article VII) a certificate or certificates
  representing that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
  Escrow Amount which shall be registered in the name of the Escrow Agent.
  Such shares shall be beneficially owned by the Principal Stockholders on
  whose behalf such shares were deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be
  available to compensate Parent as provided in Article VII. Until so
  surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to the Effective
  Time, represented shares of Company Capital Stock will be deemed from and
  after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, other than the
  payment of dividends, to evidence the ownership of the number of full
  shares of Parent Common Stock into which such shares of Company Capital
  Stock shall have been so converted.

     (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or
  other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect
  to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be
  paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the
  shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of
  record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to
  applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
  paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of
  Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, plus the amount of
  dividends or other distributions (without interest) with a record date
  after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares
  of Parent Common Stock.

     (e) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for shares of Parent
  Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
  Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
  condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will
  be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
  person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent
  designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
  issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name
  other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered.

     (f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
  Certificates evidencing shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been
  lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for
  such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon the delivery by the
  holder thereof of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof
  containing customary indemnification provisions, the shares of Parent
  Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor pursuant to the provisions of
  Article I of this Agreement.

     (g) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
  Section 1.8, neither Parent nor any party hereto shall be liable to a
  holder of shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Capital Stock for any
  amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
  abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

                                      A-6
<PAGE>

     (h) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. The shares of
  Parent Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
  deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to shares of
  Company Capital Stock outstanding prior to the Effective Time, and there
  shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Company
  of shares of Company Capital Stock that were outstanding prior to the
  Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
  Parent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in
  this Article I.

     (i) Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after
  the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry
  out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest Surviving Corporation with
  full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights,
  privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Parent, the officers
  and directors of the Company and Parent are fully authorized in the name of
  their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such
  lawful and necessary action.

  agreement to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound.

     (b) The Company has reserved 50,000,000 shares of Common Stock for
  issuance to employees and consultants pursuant to the Option Plan, of which
  6,001,367 shares are subject to outstanding, unexercised options as of the

  options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any
  character, written or oral, to which the Company is a party or by which it
  is bound obligating the Company to issue, deliver, sell, repurchase or
  redeem, or cause to be issued, delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed,
  any shares of the capital stock of the Company or obligating the Company to
  grant, extend, accelerate the vesting of, change the price of, otherwise
  amend or enter into any such option, warrant, call, right, commitment or

holding at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock,
a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock, and

Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties
hereto, the valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be

general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity. Except as set forth on
Schedule 2.4, subject only to the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by
the Company Stockholders, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company does not, and, as of the Effective Time, the consummation of the

violation of, or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both), or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of
any obligation or loss of any benefit under (any such event, a "Conflict")

or (ii) any mortgage, indenture, lease, contract or other agreement or
instrument, permit, concession, franchise, license, judgment, order, decree,

                                  ARTICLE III

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT

   As of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, Parent represents and
warrants to the Company and the Principal Stockholders as follows:

   3.1 Organization, Standing and Power. Parent is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware. Parent has the corporate power to own its properties and to carry on
its business as now being conducted and is duly qualified to do business and is
in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the
failure to be so qualified would be material to Parent.

   3.2 Authority. Subject only to the requisite approval of the issuance of
shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger by the Parent Stockholders, Parent
has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. A special committeee of
the Board of Directors of Parent formed for the purpose of considering the
proposed terms and conditions of the Merger (the "Parent Special Committee")
has unanimously approved this Agreement and the issuance of Parent Common Stock
in connection with the Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Parent and

                                     A-20
<PAGE>

constitutes, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the
other parties hereto, the valid and binding obligations of Parent, enforceable
in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or
other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by
general principles of equity, proceeding at law or in equity. Subject only to
the approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger by the Parent
Stockholders, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent does not,
and, as of the Effective Time, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not, Conflict with (i) any provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Parent or (ii) any judgment, order,
decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Parent or its
properties or assets. No consent, waiver, approval, order or authorization of,
or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity or any
third party (so as not to trigger any Conflict) is required by or with respect
to Parent in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for (i) the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State, (ii)
such consents, waivers, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
declarations and filings as may be required under applicable federal and state
securities laws, (iii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR
Act.

   3.3 Capital Structure.

     (a) The authorized stock of Parent consists of 500,000,000 shares of
  Common Stock, of which 188,933,510 shares were issued and outstanding as of
  October 31, 2000, and no shares of Preferred Stock. All such shares have
  been duly authorized, and all such issued and outstanding shares have been
  validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and are free of any liens
  or encumbrances other than any liens or encumbrances created by or imposed
  upon the holders thereof.

     (b) The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the
  Merger, when issued, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,
  non-assessable and issued in compliance with applicable federal and state
  securities laws.

   3.4 SEC Documents; Parent Financial Statements. Parent has furnished or made
available to the Company true and complete copies of all reports or
registration statements filed by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") since January 1, 2000, all in the form so filed (all of the
foregoing being collectively referred to as the "SEC Documents"). As of their
respective filing dates, the SEC Documents complied in all material respects
with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") or
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") as the case may be,
and none of the SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which
they were made, not misleading, except to the extent corrected by a document
subsequently filed with the SEC. The financial statements of Parent, including
the notes thereto, included in the SEC Documents (the "Parent Financial
Statements") comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-
Q of the SEC) and present fairly the consolidated financial position of Parent
at the dates thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and cash
flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements,
to normal audit adjustments). There has been no change in Parent accounting
policies except as described in the notes to the Parent Financial Statements;
provided, however, the Parent may have restated or may restate one or more of
the Parent Financial Statements to reflect acquisitions entered into subsequent
to the respective dates thereof. No Parent Material Adverse Effect has occurred
since the date of the balance sheet included in the Parent Financial Statements
and prior to the date hereof.

   3.5 Registration Statement; Proxy Statement; Other Filings. None of the
information supplied or to be supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in (i) Parent's Registration Statement (as defined in Section 5.1
hereof) will at the time it is declared or ordered effective under the
Securities Act, contain any

                                     A-21
<PAGE>

untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading; and (ii)
the Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 5.1 hereof) shall not, on the date
the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Parent Stockholders and the Company
Stockholders, at the time of the Parent Stockholders' Meeting (as defined in
Section 5.1 hereof) or the Company Stockholders' Meeting (as defined in Section
5.1 hereof) and at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading, or omit to
state any material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier
communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting or the Company Stockholders' Meeting which has become
false or misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event
relating to Parent or any of its affiliates, officers or directors should be
discovered by Parent, which Parent reasonably believes should be set forth in
an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement or Parent Registration
Statement, Parent shall promptly inform the Company. The Proxy Statement will
comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder that are applicable by
reason of the Proxy Statement constituting a proxy statement of Parent and the
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent makes no representation or
warranty with respect to any information supplied by Company which is contained
in any of the foregoing documents.

   3.6 No Litigation. There is no action, investigation or proceeding pending
against, and to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against or effecting Parent
before any court or Governmental Entity which in any manner challenges or seeks
to prevent, enjoin, alter or delay any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

   3.7 Compliance with Laws. Parent has complied with, is not in violation of,
and has not received any notices of violation with respect to, any federal,
state or local statute, law or regulation with respect to the conduct of its
business, or the ownership or operation of its business, except for failures to
comply or violations which would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

   3.8 Opinion of Financial Advisor. Chase H&Q has delivered to the Parent
Special Committee its oral opinion to the effect that, as of the date of this
Agreement, the Exchange Ratio is fair to Parent from a financial point of view,
which opinion was or will promptly after the date of this Agreement be
confirmed in writing.

                                   ARTICLE IV

shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by the Principal Stockholders in
exchange for their Company Capital Stock and any outstanding options, warrants
or other rights to acquire or receive shares of Company Capital Stock in the
Merger shall be subject to vesting or lock-up for a period of five (5) years
from the Effective Time as set forth in such Restricted Stock and Lock-Up
Agreement.

   5.9 FIRPTA Compliance. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a properly executed statement in a form reasonably acceptable
to Parent for purposes of satisfying Parent's obligations under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3).

   5.10 Termination of Benefits Plans. The Company shall terminate, effective
at least as of the day immediately preceding the Effective Time: (i) any and
all group severance, separation or salary continuation plans, programs, or
arrangements, and (ii) any and all 401(k) plans, unless Parent provides written
notice to the Company at least five (5) days prior to the Effective Time that
such 401(k) plan(s) shall not be terminated. Parent shall receive from the
Company evidence that the Company's plan(s) and/or program(s) have been
terminated pursuant to resolutions of each such entity's Board of Directors
(the form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and
approval of Parent), effective at least as of the day immediately preceding the
Effective Time. In the event that distribution or rollover of assets from the
trust of a 401(k) plan which is terminated is reasonably anticipated to trigger
liquidation charges, surrender charges, or other fees to be imposed upon the
account of any participant or beneficiary of such terminated plan or upon the
Company or plan sponsor, then the Company shall take such actions as are
necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and
provide such estimate in writing to Parent prior to the Effective Time and
Parent shall pay any such amounts that would be imposed on the account of any
participant or beneficiary directly to the service provider imposing such
amounts, if permitted by such service provider, or if payment by Parent is not
permitted by such service provider, Parent shall reimburse the participant or
beneficiary directly for such amounts.

proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and

filings, and to remove any injunctions or other impediments or delays, legal or
otherwise, in order to consummate and make effective the transactions

or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) any failure of the Company or Parent,
as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; such that the
conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or (b) or Section 6.3(a) or (b) would

Company Affiliates pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and to issue
appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for Parent Common
Stock, consistent with the terms of such Affiliate Agreements.

   5.14 Form S-8. Parent agrees to file a registration statement on Form S-8

     (b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
  or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not
  the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
  merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
  properties and assets to any person, then, in each such case, Parent shall

  Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section
  5.16.

the Company; provided that Parent may effect a Transfer to any person or entity
where as a pre-condition to such Transfer the transferee agrees to be bound by
all of the terms and conditions of this Section 5.17 and delivers a duly
executed agreement to the Company as evidence of such agreement. This Section
5.17 is intended to bind Parent only with respect to the specific matters set
forth herein.

request of the other party hereto, shall execute and deliver such other
instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be necessary
or desirable for effecting completely the consummation of this Agreement and

   5.19 Reorganization Treatment. Neither Parent nor the Company has taken or
will take any action, or has failed to take or will fail to take any action,
either before or after the Closing which could reasonably be expected to cause

purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

   5.20 Employment; Parent or Surviving Corporation Employee Benefit Plans.

  or in the absence of plan terms or provisions, in accordance with the
  regularly established policies or procedures of either Parent or the
  Surviving Corporation.

     (b) Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize
  the employment service of each Affected Employee with the Company for
  purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual) under any

  Employee by the Company in the calendar year of the Effective Time.

"Expiration Date").

   7.2 Escrow Arrangements.

     (a) Escrow Fund. At the Effective Time, the Principal Stockholders will
  be deemed to have received and deposited with the Escrow Agent (as defined
  below) the Escrow Amount (plus any additional shares as may be issued upon
  any stock split, stock dividend or recapitalization effected by Parent
  after the Effective Time) without any act of any Principal Stockholder. As
  soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Escrow Amount, without
  any act of any Company Stockholder, will be deposited with U.S. Bank Trust,
  National Association (or other institution acceptable to Parent and the
  Securityholder Agent (as defined in Section 7.2(g) below)), as Escrow Agent
  (the "Escrow Agent"), such deposit to constitute an escrow fund (the
  "Escrow Fund") to be governed by the terms set forth herein and at Parent's
  cost and expense. Subject to the provisions of this Section 7.2, the Escrow
  Fund shall be available to compensate Parent and its affiliates for any
  claims, losses, liabilities, damages, deficiencies, costs and expenses,
  including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of investigation and
  defense (hereinafter individually a "Loss" and collectively "Losses")
  incurred by Parent, its officers, directors, or affiliates (including the
  Surviving Corporation) directly or indirectly as a result of any inaccuracy
  or breach of a representation or warranty of the Company and the Principal
  Stockholders (as modified by the Company Schedules) or any failure by the
  Company to perform or comply with any covenant contained herein. Parent and
  the

                                     A-32
<PAGE>

  Company each acknowledge that such Losses, if any, would relate to
  unresolved contingencies existing at the Effective Time, which if resolved
  at the Effective Time would have led to a change in the Exchange Ratio.
  Nothing herein shall limit the liability of the Company, the Principal
  Stockholders or Parent for any breach of any representation, warranty or
  covenant if the Merger does not close.

     (b) Escrow Period; Distribution upon Termination of Escrow
  Periods. Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in
  existence immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at
  5:00 p.m., California time, on the Expiration Date (the "Escrow Period");
  provided that the Escrow Period shall not terminate with respect to such
  amount (or some portion thereof) of the Escrow Fund that is specified in
  any Officer's Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the
  termination of such Escrow Period, subject to the objection of the
  Securityholder Agent and the subsequent resolution of the matter in the
  manner provided in Section 7.2(f) hereof, to satisfy any unsatisfied claims
  concerning facts and circumstances existing prior to the termination of
  such Escrow Period specified in any such Officer's Certificate delivered to
  the Escrow Agent prior to termination of such Escrow Period. As soon as all
  such claims have been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the
  Principal Stockholders the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund not
  required to satisfy such claims. Deliveries of Escrow Amounts to the
  Principal Stockholders pursuant to this Section 7.2(b) shall be made in
  proportion to their respective original contributions to the Escrow Fund as
  determined pursuant to Section 1.8(b).

     (c) Protection of Escrow Fund.

      (i) The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund during
   the Escrow Period, shall treat such fund as a trust fund in accordance
   with the terms of this Agreement and not as the property of Parent and
   shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the
   terms hereof.

      (ii) Any shares of Parent Common Stock or other equity securities
   issued or distributed by Parent (including shares issued upon a stock
   split) ("New Shares") in respect of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow
   Fund which have not been released from the Escrow Fund shall be added to
   the Escrow Fund and become a part thereof. New Shares issued in respect
   of shares of Parent Common Stock which have been released from the Escrow
   Fund shall not be added to the Escrow Fund but shall be distributed to
   the recordholders thereof. Cash dividends on Parent Common Stock shall
   not be added to the Escrow Fund but shall be distributed to the
   recordholders thereof.

      (iii) Each Principal Stockholder shall have voting rights with respect
   to the shares of Parent Common Stock contributed to the Escrow Fund by
   such Company Stockholder (and on any voting securities added to the
   Escrow Fund in respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock).

     (d) Claims Upon Escrow Fund.

      (i) Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent at any time on or before the last
   day of the Escrow Period of a certificate signed by any officer of Parent
   (an "Officer's Certificate"): (A) stating that Parent has paid or
   properly accrued or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay or
   accrue Losses, and (B) specifying in reasonable detail the individual
   items of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each such item
   was paid or properly accrued, or the basis for such anticipated
   liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or
   covenant to which such item is related, the Escrow Agent shall, subject
   to the provisions of Section 7.2 hereof, deliver to Parent out of the
   Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable, shares of Parent Common Stock
   held in the Escrow Fund in an amount equal to such Losses.

      (ii) For purposes of determining the number of shares of Parent Common
   Stock to be delivered to Parent out of the Escrow Fund pursuant to
   Section 7.2(d)(i) hereof, the shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
   valued at the average closing price per share of Parent Common Stock on
   the Nasdaq National Market for the five trading days immediately
   preceding the Closing Date (the "Average Stock Price").

     (e) Objections to Claims. At the time of delivery of any Officer's
  Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such certificate shall
  be delivered to the Securityholder Agent (as defined in

                                     A-33
<PAGE>

  Section 7.2(g)) and for a period of thirty (30) days after such delivery to
  the Escrow Agent and the Securityholder Agent, the Escrow Agent shall make
  no delivery to Parent of any Escrow Amounts pursuant to Section 7.2(d)
  hereof unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization
  from the Securityholder Agent to make such delivery. After the expiration
  of such thirty (30)-day period, the Escrow Agent shall make delivery of
  shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in accordance with
  Section 7.2(d) hereof, provided that no such payment or delivery may be
  made if the Securityholder Agent shall object in a written statement to the
  claim made in the Officer's Certificate, and such statement shall have been
  delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of such thirty
  (30)-day period.

     (f) Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration.

      (i) In case the Securityholder Agent shall so object in writing to any
   claim or claims made in any Officer's Certificate, the Securityholder
   Agent and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of
   the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the
   Securityholder Agent and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting
   forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and
   shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be
   entitled to rely on any such memorandum and distribute shares of Parent
   Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.

      (ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation,
   either Parent or the Securityholder Agent may demand arbitration of the
   matter unless the amount of the damage or loss is at issue in pending
   litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be
   commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to
   arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be settled by
   arbitration conducted by three arbitrators. Parent and the Securityholder
   Agent shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so
   selected shall select a third arbitrator. The arbitrators shall set a
   limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost
   and time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity,
   adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrators, to discover relevant
   information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the
   dispute. The arbitrators shall rule upon motions to compel or limit
   discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including
   attorneys' fees and costs, to the extent as a court of competent law or
   equity, should the arbitrators determine that discovery was sought
   without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or
   objected to without substantial justification. The decision of a majority
   of the three arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in
   such Officer's Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the
   parties to this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything in Section 7.2(e)
   hereof, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such
   decision and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in
   accordance therewith. Such decision shall be written and shall be
   supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set
   forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrators.

      (iii) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be
   entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be
   held in Santa Clara County, California under the rules then in effect of
   the American Arbitration Association. For purposes of this Section
   7.2(f), in any arbitration hereunder in which any claim or the amount
   thereof stated in the Officer's Certificate is at issue, the Non-
   Prevailing Party, if any, shall be determined by the arbitrators. The
   Non-Prevailing Party to an arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the
   fees of each arbitrator, the administrative costs of the arbitration and
   the expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees
   and costs, incurred by the other party to the arbitration.

     (g) Securityholder Agent of the Stockholders; Power of Attorney.

      (i) Paul Levy is hereby appointed as agent and attorney-in-fact (the
   "Securityholder Agent") for each Principal Stockholder, to give and
   receive notices and communications, to authorize delivery to Parent of
   shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of
   claims by Parent, to object to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate,
   enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand

                                     A-34
<PAGE>

   arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators
   with respect to such claims, and to take all actions necessary or
   appropriate in the judgment of Securityholder Agent for the
   accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the
   Principal Stockholders from time to time upon not less than thirty (30)
   days prior written notice to Parent; provided that the Securityholder
   Agent may not be removed unless holders of a two-thirds interest of the
   Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted
   agent. Any vacancy in the position of Securityholder Agent may be filled
   by approval of the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund.
   No bond shall be required of the Securityholder Agent, and the
   Securityholder Agent shall not receive compensation for his or her
   services. Notices or communications to or from the Securityholder Agent
   shall constitute notice to or from each of the Principal Stockholders for
   purposes of this Section 7.2.

      (ii) The Securityholder Agent shall not be liable for any act done or
   omitted hereunder as Securityholder Agent while acting in good faith and
   in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Principal Stockholders on
   whose behalf the Escrow Amount was contributed to the Escrow Fund shall
   severally indemnify the Securityholder Agent and hold the Securityholder
   Agent harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without
   negligence or bad faith on the part of the Securityholder Agent and
   arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of
   the Securityholder Agent's duties hereunder, including the reasonable
   fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Securityholder
   Agent.

      (iii) The Securityholder Agent shall have reasonable access to
   information about the Company and the reasonable assistance of the
   Company's officers and employees for purposes of performing his duties
   and exercising his rights hereunder; provided, that the Securityholder
   Agent shall treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic
   information from or about the Company to anyone (except on a need to know
   basis to individuals who agree to treat such information confidentially).

     (h) Actions of the Securityholder Agent. A decision, act, consent or
  instruction of the Securityholder Agent shall constitute a decision of the
  Principal Stockholders for whom a portion of the Escrow Amount otherwise
  issuable to them are deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be final,
  binding and conclusive upon each of such Principal Stockholder, and the
  Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or
  instruction of the Securityholder Agent as being the decision, act, consent
  or instruction of each every such Principal Stockholder. The Escrow Agent
  and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any
  acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
  instruction of the Securityholder Agent.

     (i) Third-Party Claims. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third-
  party claim which Parent believes may result in a demand against the Escrow
  Fund, Parent shall notify the Securityholder Agent of such claim, and the
  Securityholder Agent, as representative for the Principal Stockholders,
  shall be entitled, at their expense, to participate in any defense of such
  claim. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to settle any
  such claim; provided, however, that except with the consent of the
  Securityholder Agent, no settlement of any such claim with third party
  claimants shall alone be determinative of the amount of any claim against
  the Escrow Fund. In the event that the Securityholder Agent has consented
  to any such settlement, the Securityholder Agent shall have no power or
  authority to object under any provision of this Article VII to the amount
  of any claim by Parent against the Escrow Fund with respect to such
  settlement.

     (j) Escrow Agent's Duties.

      (i) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of
   such duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any
   additional written escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive
   after the date of this Agreement which are signed by an officer of Parent
   and the Securityholder Agent, and may rely and shall be protected in
   relying or refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed
   to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or
   parties. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
   hereunder as Escrow Agent

                                     A-35
<PAGE>

   while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment,
   and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be
   conclusive evidence of such good faith.

      (ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to comply with
   and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court of law,
   notwithstanding any notices, warnings or other communications from any
   party or any other person to the contrary. In case the Escrow Agent obeys
   or complies with any such order, judgment or decree of any court, the
   Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any
   other person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such
   order, judgment or decree being subsequently reversed, modified,
   annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered without
   jurisdiction.

      (iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account
   of the identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or
   delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any
   documents or papers deposited or called for hereunder.

      (iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any
   rights under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or
   any documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.

      (v) In performing any duties under the Agreement, the Escrow Agent
   shall not be liable to any party for damages, losses, or expenses, except
   for gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow
   Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability for (A) any
   act or failure to act made or omitted in good faith, or (B) any action
   taken or omitted in reliance upon any instrument, including any written
   statement or affidavit provided for in this Agreement that the Escrow
   Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine, nor will the Escrow
   Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or
   determining the scope of any representative authority. In addition, the
   Escrow Agent may consult with the legal counsel in connection with Escrow
   Agent's duties under this Agreement and shall be fully protected in any
   act taken, suffered, or permitted by him/her in good faith in accordance
   with the advice of counsel. The Escrow Agent is not responsible for
   determining and verifying the authority of any person acting or
   purporting to act on behalf of any party to this Agreement.

      (vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement,
   or with any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement,
   its terms or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to
   determine the controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow
   Agent may hold all documents and shares of Parent Common Stock and may
   wait for settlement of any such controversy by final appropriate legal
   proceedings or other means as, in the Escrow Agent's discretion, the
   Escrow Agent may be required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in
   this Agreement. In such event, the Escrow Agent will not be liable for
   damage. Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at its option, file an action
   of interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims
   and rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit
   with the clerk of the court all documents and shares of Parent Common
   Stock held in escrow, except all cost, expenses, charges and reasonable
   attorney fees incurred by the Escrow Agent due to the interpleader action
   and which the parties jointly and severally agree to pay. Upon initiating
   such action, the Escrow Agent shall be fully released and discharged of
   and from all obligations and liability imposed by the terms of this
   Agreement.

      (viii) The parties and their respective successors and assigns agree
   jointly and severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless against
   any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including
   reasonable costs of investigation, counsel fees, and disbursements that
   may be imposed on Escrow Agent or incurred by Escrow Agent in connection
   with the performance of his/her duties under this Agreement, including
   but not limited to any litigation arising from this Agreement or
   involving its subject matter.

      (viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least
   thirty (30) days written notice to the parties; provided, however, that
   no such resignation shall become effective until the appointment of a
   successor escrow agent which shall be accomplished as follows: the
   parties shall use their

                                     A-36
<PAGE>

   reasonable best efforts to mutually agree on a successor escrow agent
   within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice. If the parties fail
   to agree upon a successor escrow agent within such time, the Escrow Agent
   shall have the right to appoint a successor escrow agent authorized to do
   business in the State of California. The successor escrow agent shall
   execute and deliver an instrument accepting such appointment and it
   shall, without further acts, be vested with all the estates, properties,
   rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor escrow agent as if
   originally named as escrow agent. The Escrow Agent shall be discharged
   from any further duties and liability under this Agreement.

     (k) Fees. All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties
  hereunder shall be paid by Parent. It is understood that the fees and usual
  charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered
  compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement. In
  the event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled,
  or if the Escrow Agent renders any service not provided for in this
  Agreement, or if the parties request a substantial modification of its
  terms, or if any controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a party
  to, or intervenes in, any litigation pertaining to this escrow or its
  subject matter, the Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such
  extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs, attorney's fees, and
  expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy or litigation.
  Parent promises to pay these sums upon demand.

     (l) Maximum Payments; Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
  set forth in this Article VII or elsewhere in this Agreement, except with
  respect to fraudulent breaches of the representations, warranties or
  covenants of the Company and/or the Principal Stockholders contained in
  this Agreement ("Fraudulent Breach") the maximum amount the Parent may
  recover pursuant to the indemnity obligations set forth in Section 7.2
  hereof shall be limited to the Escrow Amount and, subject to the following
  sentence, Parent shall not be entitled to pursue any claims for
  indemnification under this Article VII or otherwise against the Principal
  Stockholders directly or personally. The Principal Stockholders'
  indemnification obligations with respect to any Fraudulent Breach shall be
  unlimited.

     (m) Deductible. The Principal Stockholders shall not be required to make
  any indemnification payment pursuant to this Section 7.2 until such time as
  the total amount of all Losses that have been directly or indirectly
  incurred by the Parent, or to which the Parent has otherwise become
  subject, exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Deductible") in the aggregate. If the
  total amount of such Losses exceeds $1,000,000, then the Parent shall be
  entitled to be indemnified against and compensated and reimbursed only for
  the portion of such Losses exceeding $1,000,000.

     (n) Obligation to Mitigate Losses. Parent shall use its commercially
  reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses in connection with an indemnity
  claim made pursuant to this Section 7.2 with the scope to be as required by
  applicable law.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                       TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

   8.1 Termination. Except as provided in Section 8.2 below, this Agreement may
be terminated and the Merger abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time:

     (a) by mutual consent of the Company and Parent;

     (b) by Parent or Company if: (i) the Effective Time has not occurred
  before 5:00 p.m. (Pacific time) on June 30, 2001 (the "Termination Date")
  (provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
  8.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party whose willful failure to
  fulfill any obligation hereunder has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
  failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such date); (ii) there
  shall be a final nonappealable order of a federal or state court in effect
  preventing consummation of the Merger; or (iii) there shall be any statute,
  rule, regulation or order enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed
  applicable to the Merger by any Governmental Entity that would make
  consummation of the Merger illegal;

                                     A-37
<PAGE>

     (c) by Parent if there shall be any action taken, or any statute, rule,
  regulation or order enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to
  the Merger, by any Governmental Entity, which would: (i) prohibit Parent's
  or the Company's ownership or operation of all or any portion of the
  business of the Company or (ii) compel Parent or the Company to dispose of
  or hold separate all or a portion of the business or assets of the Company
  or Parent as a result of the Merger;

     (d) by Parent, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
  or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, or if
  any representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, in
  either case such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section
  6.3(b) would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the
  time such representation or warranty shall have become untrue, provided
  that if such inaccuracy in the Company's representations and warranties or
  breach by the Company is curable by the Company through the exercise of its
  reasonable best efforts, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under
  this Section 8.1(d) prior to the Termination Date, provided the Company
  continues to exercise reasonable best efforts to cure such breach (it being
  understood that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
  Section 8.1(d) if it shall have materially breached this Agreement or if
  such breach by the Company is cured prior to the Termination Date);

     (e) by the Company, upon a breach of any representation, warranty,
  covenant or agreement on the part of Parent set forth in this Agreement, or
  if any representation or warranty of Parent shall have become untrue, in
  either case such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section
  6.2(b) would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the
  time such representation or warranty shall have become untrue, provided,
  that if such inaccuracy in Parent's representations and warranties or
  breach by Parent is curable by Parent through the exercise of its
  reasonable best efforts, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement
  under this Section 8.1(e) prior to the Termination Date, provided Parent
  continues to exercise reasonable best efforts to cure such breach (it being
  understood that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
  this Section 8.1(e) if it shall have materially breached this Agreement or
  if such breach by the Company is cured prior to the Termination Date);

     (f) by Parent or the Company if Parent fails to obtain the requisite
  vote necessary to approve the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in
  the Merger at the Parent Stockholders' Meeting (or at any adjournment or
  postponement thereof); provided, however, that the right to terminate this
  Agreement shall not be available to Parent or the Company where the failure
  to obtain Parent Stockholder approval shall have been caused by the action
  or failure to act of Parent or the Company, respectively, and such action
  or failure to act constitutes a material breach of this Agreement;

     (g) by Parent, if an event or change having a Company Material Adverse
  Effect shall have occurred after the date of this Agreement; and

     (h) by the Company, if an event or change having a Parent Material
  Adverse Effect shall have occurred after the date of this Agreement.

   Where action is taken to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1, it shall be sufficient for such action to be authorized by the Board of
Directors (as applicable) of the party taking such action.

   8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, or their respective officers, directors or stockholders, provided that
each party shall remain liable for any breaches of this Agreement prior to its
termination; and provided further that, the provisions of Section 5.5 and
Section 7.2 of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and survive
any termination of this Agreement.

   8.3 Amendment. Except as is otherwise required by applicable law after the
stockholders of Parent and the Company approve this Agreement, this Agreement
may be amended by the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto; provided that the
consent of Merger Sub shall not be required to effect any further amendment of
this Agreement.

<PAGE>

   8.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent, on
the one hand, and the Company and Principal Stockholders, on the other, may, to
the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations of the other party hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party.

   9.2 Interpretation. The words "include," "includes" and "including" when
used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation." As used herein, the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall
mean a material adverse effect on the business, assets (including intangible
assets), financial condition, capitalization or results of operations of the
Company, except that none of the following shall be deemed in themselves to
constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect: (i) any change in general
economic conditions, (ii) any adverse change affecting Company's industry
generally, or (iii) transaction costs, taxes, accounting changes and other
adverse effects that result from the announcement, pendancy or consummation of
the Merger. The term "Parent Material Adverse Effect" shall mean any change
that has had a material adverse effect on the business, assets (including
intangible assets), financial condition, capitalization or results of
operations of Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except that none
of the following shall be deemed in themselves to constitute a Parent Material
Adverse Effect: (i) any change in the market price or trading volume of Parent
Common Stock, (ii) any change in general economic conditions, (iii) any adverse
change affecting Parent's industry generally, or (iv) transaction costs, taxes,
accounting changes, integration costs and other adverse effects that result
from the announcement, pendency or consummation of the Merger. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

   9.3 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

                                     A-40
<PAGE>

   9.4 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement, the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto, and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the
parties hereto referenced herein: (a) constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof; (b) are not intended to confer upon any
other person any rights or remedies hereunder (except for the intended
beneficiaries under Sections 1.6(b), 1.6(c), 5.17, 5.19 and 5.20; and (c) shall
not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise except as otherwise
specifically provided, except that Parent may assign its rights to any of its
wholly owned subsidiaries; provided that such an assignment of rights shall in
no way relieve Parent of any of its obligations hereunder.

   9.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

   9.6 Other Remedies. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with
and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity
upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

   9.7 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of California, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof, except that matters related to the Merger and matters related to the
corporate governance of each of the Company and Parent shall be governed by the
laws of the State of Delaware. Each of the parties hereto agrees that process
may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of
California for such persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any
objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction and such
process.

   9.8 Rules of Construction. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

   9.9 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state
having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity.

   9.10 Release of Merger Sub. Merger Sub is hereby forever unconditionally and
irrevocably released and discharged from the Original Agreement and from all of
its obligations and liabilities thereunder and shall cease for all purposes to
be a party to this Agreement.

   9.11 Waiver of Certain Inaccuracies. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, any failure of any of the representations and warranties made
by any party in this Agreement to be true and correct in all material respects
solely due to the fact that the Original Agreement provided for the merger of
the Company with and into Merger Sub, whereas this Agreement provides for the
merger of the Company with and into Parent, shall not constitute a breach of,
or constitute a failure of a condition under, this Agreement.

                 (Remainder of page intentionally left blank.)
