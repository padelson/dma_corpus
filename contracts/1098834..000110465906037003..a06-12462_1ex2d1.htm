_Constituent Corporations_ ").

  



  

 **RECITALS:**

  



  

A. The respective Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent, Buyer and
Acquisition Sub have each unanimously (i) determined that the Merger, as
contemplated by this Agreement, is advisable to and in the best interests of
their respective corporations, and in the case of the Company, its
shareholders, and (ii) approved the Merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

B. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations,
warranties and agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

  



  

# ** _ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER_**

  

# _ _

  

 **Section 1.1** ** _The Merger_. **At the Effective Time and upon the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the
Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the " _DGCL_ "), Acquisition
Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger"_ ). Following
the Merger, the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate existence of
Acquisition Sub shall cease.

  



  

 **Section 1.2** ** _Effective Time_. **Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, a Certificate of
Merger in a form to be agreed upon by the parties (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") shall be duly executed and acknowledged by the Company and
thereafter delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware for
filing pursuant to Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective
at such time as a properly executed copy of the Certificate of Merger is duly
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with
Section 251 of the DGCL or such later time as Buyer and the Company may
mutually agree upon and as set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the time
the Merger becomes effective being referred to herein as the " _Effective
Time_ ").

  



  

 **Section 1.3** ** _Closing of the Merger_. **The closing of the Merger
(the " _Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of Wiggin and Dana, 450
Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017, at a time and on a date (the "
_Closing Date_ ") to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later
than the second (2nd) business day after satisfaction (or waiver) of the
latest to occur of the conditions set forth in Article 6, except for such
conditions that may only be satisfied by delivery of documents or
certificates at the Closing, unless another time, date or place is agreed
upon in writing by the Company and Buyer.

  



  

 **Section 1.4** ** _Effects of the Merger_. **The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Acquisition Sub
shall vest

        
   

  



  

in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Acquisition Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

 **Section 1.5** ** _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. **At the
Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended to read the same as the Certificate of Incorporation of
Acquisition Sub in effect at the Effective Time, and shall be the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with Applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that at the
Effective Time, Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read
as follows: "The name of this corporation is Fargo Electronics, Inc. **.** "
 At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
be amended as necessary to read the same as the bylaws of Acquisition Sub
in effect at the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance
with Applicable Law.

  



  

 **Section 1.6** ** _Directors_. **The directors of Acquisition Sub at the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation,
each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until such directors successor is duly
elected or appointed and qualified.

  



  

 **Section 1.7** ** _Officers_. **The officers of Acquisition Sub at the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation,
each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until such officers successor is duly
elected or appointed and qualified.

  



  

 **Section 1.8** ** _Conversion of Shares_. **At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Buyer,
Acquisition Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of common stock, par
value $.01 per share, of the Company (each a " _Share_ " and, collectively,
the " _Shares_ ") or any shares of stock of Acquisition Sub:

  



  

(a) Each Share, together with the associated right (a "Company Right") issued
pursuant to the Right Agreement, dated February 9, 2000, between the Company
and Norwest Bank, N.A., as agent (the "Company Rights Agreement"), that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
any Shares described in Sections 1.8(b) and (c) and any Appraisal Shares)
shall be converted into the right to receive $25.50 in cash, without interest
(the "Merger Consideration").

  



  

(b) Each Share, together with the associated Company Right, that is owned by
Parent, Buyer or Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) Each Share, together with the associated Company Right, that is held in
the treasury of the Company or owned by the Company or any of its wholly-
owned Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

  



  

(d) Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Acquisition Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  



        
   

  



  

(e) Shares that have not been voted for approval of this Agreement or
consented thereto in writing and with respect to which written objection to
the Merger has been properly made in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(" _Appraisal Shares_ "), will not be converted into the right to receive
from Buyer the Merger Consideration otherwise payable with respect to such
Shares at or after the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and automatically shall be cancelled
and shall cease to exist, and, except as provided by Applicable Laws, each
holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to the
Appraisal Shares, other than such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the
DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a holder of Appraisal Shares (an "
_Appraisal Shareholder_ ") shall fail to validly perfect or shall waive or
withdraw his or her objection or demand for payment of the fair value of his
or her Shares, or if such Appraisal Shares (or such other shares with respect
to which appraisal rights have not terminated) become ineligible for such
payment or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
Appraisal Shareholder is not entitled to relief under Section 262 of the
DGCL, then, as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event of
withdrawal or ineligibility, whichever last occurs, such holders Appraisal
Shares will cease to be Appraisal Shares (or, in the case of such other
shares, the appraisal rights shall have terminated) and each such Share will
be converted into the right to receive, and will be exchangeable for, the
Merger Consideration into which such Appraisal Shares (or such other shares)
would have been converted pursuant to Section 1.8, without interest. The
Company shall promptly give Buyer notice of any objection to the Merger
received by the Company from an Appraisal Shareholder, and Buyer shall have
the reasonable opportunity, at its sole expense, to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such objection. The Company
agrees that, except with the prior written consent of Buyer and Acquisition
Sub, or as required under the DGCL, it will not voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer or agree to settle, any such objection.
Each Appraisal Shareholder or other shareholder who, pursuant to the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, becomes entitled to payment of the
fair value of the Appraisal Shares (or other shares) will receive payment
therefor after the fair value therefor has been agreed upon or finally
determined pursuant to such provisions, and any Merger Consideration that
would have been payable with respect to such Appraisal Shares (or other
shares) will be retained by Buyer.

  



  

 **Section 1.9** ** _Payment of Merger Consideration_.**

  



  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of Shares
that are not Appraisal Shares (collectively, the " _Holders_ "), Buyer shall
designate, or shall cause to be designated (pursuant to an agreement in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company), a bank or trust company
that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as agent for the
payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of Certificates upon surrender
of such Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.9 (the " _Paying
Agent_ "). At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Buyer
shall deposit with, or cause Acquisition Sub to deposit with, the Paying
Agent cash in an amount sufficient to permit the payment of the aggregate
Merger Consideration to the Holders (assuming no Appraisal Shares) upon
surrender of the Certificates (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent
shall exchange the Shares, and their associated Company Rights, for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Article I, through
such reasonable procedures as the Paying Agent may adopt and as are
acceptable to the Company.

  



  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but not more
than five (5) business days thereafter), Buyer shall cause the Paying Agent
to mail to each record holder of a certificate or certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon actual and proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent,
and shall contain instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates and

  



        
   

  



  

payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be paid in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the Shares,
and their associated Company Rights, formerly represented by the Certificate
shall have been converted pursuant to Section 1.8, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall be cancelled. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but not more than five (5) business days thereafter), the
Buyer shall cause to be delivered to the holders of Company Stock Options
cash in the amount required under Section 1.10. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the
Company, the proper amount of cash may be paid in exchange therefor to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if the Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such payment shall either
pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of Buyer that the tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

  



  

(c) The Paying Agent may invest cash included in the Exchange Fund, as
reasonably directed by Buyer, on a daily basis, in interest bearing accounts
(U.S. Treasury money market accounts) with any financial institution rated A
or higher by Standard and Poors and Moodys and having assets in excess of $50
billion. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall
be the property of, and shall be paid to, Buyer. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund (including any interest and other income resulting from investments of
the Exchange Fund) that remains undistributed to the former Holders eighteen
(18) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Buyer, upon demand
of Buyer, and any former Holders who have not theretofore complied with this
Article I shall thereafter look only to Buyer for payment of the Merger
Consideration. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, none of
Parent, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any holder of Shares for cash properly delivered to a
public official in connection herewith pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

  



  

 **Section 1.10** ** _Options_.**

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option, whether or
not then exercisable, shall be cancelled in exchange for a single lump sum
cash payment equal to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option
as of the Effective Time, and (B) the number of Shares issuable upon exercise
of such Company Stock Option (the " _Option Merger Payment Amount_ "), less
any applicable tax or other withholdings.

  



  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall take any actions as may be required in order that (i) each
outstanding Company Stock Option shall automatically accelerate so that each
such Company Stock Option shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
become fully exercisable for all of the Shares at the time subject to such
Company Stock Option and may be exercised by the holder thereof for any or
all of such Shares as fully-vested Shares and (ii) upon the Effective Time,
all outstanding Company Stock Options, to the extent not exercised prior to
the Effective Time, shall be cancelled (and each holder of a Company Stock
Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto) in exchange for
the consideration, if any, set forth in Section 1.10(a).

  



        
   

  



  

(c) Effective as of the date hereof, the Company Board has taken action,
under the Companys 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (as amended on December
8, 2005, the "Employee Stock Purchase Plan"): (i) to terminate the current
offering period and provide that all payroll deductions credited to the
accounts of plan participants be returned to such participants, (ii) to
suspend the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and not hold any offering periods
under such plan unless and until the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms and (iii) to terminate the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan, effective as of the Effective Time. Promptly after the
execution of this Agreement (but in any event on or before May 31, 2006),
the Company will provide notice to all plan participants of such termination
of the current offering period which termination will be effective five
days thereafter.

  



  

 **Section 1.11** ** _Shareholders  Vote on Merger_.**

  



  

(a) Subject to Section 5.3, the Company, acting through its Board of
Directors, shall, in accordance with Applicable Law, and for the sole purpose
of considering and taking action upon the Merger and this Agreement, as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in conjunction
with Buyer, prepare and file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") a Proxy Statement pursuant to Regulation 14A (the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") in connection with approval of the Merger and adoption of this
Agreement by vote of the shareholders of the Company and use its reasonable
best efforts (i) to respond to any comments made by the SEC with respect to
the Proxy Statement, (ii) to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its
shareholders, and (iii) to obtain the necessary approvals of the Merger and
this Agreement by its shareholders.

  



  

(b) Buyer shall provide the Company with the information concerning Parent,
Buyer and Acquisition Sub required to be included in the Proxy Statement or
reasonably requested by the Company.

  



  

(c) The Company shall provide to Buyer and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon the Proxy Statement prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC. In addition, the Company shall promptly provide
to Buyer and its counsel in writing any comments the Company or its counsel
may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement
(summaries in the case of comments received telephonically) and copies of any
written responses and summaries of any telephonic notification of any verbal
responses by the Company or its counsel. Except as required by Applicable
Law, no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or written correspondence
to or oral communication with the SEC or its staff with respect to, the Proxy
Statement will be made by or on behalf of the Company without providing Buyer
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at
any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company
or any of its affiliates, directors or officers, should be ascertained by the
Company which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement, so that such document would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the Company shall promptly notify Buyer, and the Company
shall promptly file an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information with the SEC and, to the extent required by Applicable Law,
disseminate it to the shareholders of the Company.

  



  

 **Section 1.12** ** _Withholding_. **Buyer or the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or Company Stock Options,
as the case may be, such amounts as Buyer or the Paying Agent is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended **** (the " _Code_ "), or under
any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent

  



        
   

  



  

that amounts are so withheld by Buyer or the Paying Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Shares or the Company Stock Options, as the case
may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Buyer
or the Paying Agent and transmitted by Buyer or the Paying Agent to the
appropriate taxing authority with attribution to each specific holder.

  



  

 **Section 1.13** ** _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. **All amounts
paid to Holders upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance
with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to the Shares represented by such Certificates.

  



  

 **Section 1.14** ** _Closing of Company Transfer Books_. **At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer
of Shares shall thereafter be made on the records of the Company. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation,
Buyer or Paying Agent, such Certificates shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article I.

  



  

 **Section 1.15** ** _Lost Certificates_. **If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Buyer or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a
bond in such reasonable amount as Buyer or the Paying Agent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against them with respect to
such Certificate, Buyer or the Paying Agent will pay in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the amounts to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 1.8.

  



  

 **Section 1.16** ** _Further Assurances_. **If at any time after the
Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or
things are necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of
record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises,
properties or assets of either of the Constituent Corporations, or (b)
otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving
Corporation and its proper officers and directors or their designees shall be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either of the
Constituent Corporations, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and
assurances and to do, in the name and on behalf of either Constituent
Corporation, all such other acts and things as may be necessary, desirable or
proper to vest, perfect or confirm the Surviving Corporations right, title
or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers,
franchises, properties or assets of such Constituent Corporation and
otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

 **Section 3.5** ** _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.**

  



  

(a) The Company has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be
filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 2003 (as such documents have been
amended since the time of their filing, the " _Company SEC Reports_ "). As of
their respective dates or, if amended, as of the date of the last such
amendment, the Company SEC Reports complied in all material respects with all
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (and all the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") applicable to the
Company SEC Reports and each Applicable Law as in effect on such date or
dates. None of the Company SEC Reports, including any financial statements or
schedules included or incorporated by reference therein, contained when filed
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under
which they were made not misleading, except to the extent superseded or
amended by a Company SEC Report filed subsequently and prior to the date
hereof. The Company has filed a quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal
quarter ending March 31, 2006 and an annual report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 (the " _Recent Company SEC Reports_ ").
The financial statements of the Company included in the Recent Company SEC
Reports (the " _Financial Statements_ ") fairly presented in all material
respects, in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis (" _GAAP_ ") (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto and except that unaudited statements are
subject to normal year-end adjustments and do not contain footnotes in
substance or form to the extent omission thereof is permitted by Form 10-Q of
the Exchange Act), the financial position of the Company as of the dates
thereof and its results of operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended. Neither the Company

  



        
   

  



  

nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be
reflected in a balance sheet of the Company or disclosed in the notes thereto
which individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, other than the liabilities reflected in the
Financial Statements and any liabilities or obligations that may be incurred
by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. None of the Subsidiaries of the Company are, or have at any time
been, subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act. The Company has provided to Buyer all copies of written
communications between the Company and the SEC since January 1, 2003.

  



  

(b) The Company will make available to Buyer a complete and correct copy of
any amendments, modifications and any other documents that are required to be
filed with or submitted to the SEC, but have not yet been filed with or
submitted to the SEC, to agreements, documents or other instruments that
previously had been filed with or submitted to the SEC by the Company
pursuant to the Exchange Act.

  



  

(c) Since January 1, 2003, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the
Company has received from the SEC any written complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim regarding the accounting or auditing practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company or their respective internal accounting controls, including any
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices.

  



  

(d) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer
of the Company and each former principal financial officer of the Company, as
applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14
under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
with respect to the Company SEC Reports, and the statements contained in such
certifications to the knowledge of the Company are true and accurate in all
material respects. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive
officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to
such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding, "extensions of
credit" to directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  



  

(e) The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed in
accordance with managements general or specific authorizations in all
material respects; (ii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
managements general or specific authorization; and (iii) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

  



  

(f) The Companys "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to
ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in all material
respects within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such information is accumulated and communicated in all material
respects to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company required under
the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

  



        
   

  



  

 **Section 3.6** ** _No Default_. **None of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is in material breach, default or violation (and to the
knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred that with notice or the lapse
of time or both would constitute a material breach, default or violation by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) of any term, condition or provision
of (i) the Company Charter or the organizational documents of any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) any order, writ, injunction, decree, law, statute, rule,
or regulation applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or
any of its properties or assets.

Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective employees nor, to
the knowledge of the Company, any trustee, administrator or other fiduciary

the Company, any such trustee, administrator or other fiduciary, to any
liability for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA or any other Applicable
Law.

  



  

(g) Each Company Welfare Plan may be amended or terminated (including with

director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to severance or termination pay, (B) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor
trust or otherwise), of compensation or benefits under, or increase

any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement other than full vesting
of any benefits in the event Buyer requires that the Company terminate the
Companys 401(k) plan or other Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective
Time or (C) result in any breach or violation of, or a default under, the
terms of any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement.

  



  

(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material
liability or obligations, including under or on account of a Company Benefit
Plan, arising out of the hiring of persons to provide services to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and misclassifying under Applicable Law such
persons as consultants or independent contractors and not as employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No current or former independent
contractor that provides or provided personal services to the Company or its
Subsidiaries (other than a current or former director) is entitled to any
material fringe or other benefits (other than cash consulting fees) pursuant
to any plan, program, policy or agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or which is maintained, sponsored or contributed to
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is a "defined benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA).

  



  

(l) No current or former employee or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is entitled to receive any additional payment from the Company

person by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

unfair labor practice complaint or grievance against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries by any Person pursuant to the National Labor Relations Act

 **Section 3.15** ** _Intellectual Property_.**

intellectual property rights arising under the laws of the United States or
any other jurisdiction with respect to the following: (i) trade names,
trademarks and service marks (registered and unregistered), domain names,

(ii) patents and patent applications and all reissues, divisions, renewals,
extensions provisionals, continuations, and continuations-in-part thereof
(collectively, " _Patents_ "); (iii) copyrights and registrations and
applications therefor (collectively, " _Copyrights_ "); (iv) mask work and
similar rights, including rights created under Sections 901-914 of Title 17
of the United States Code, including all registrations and applications to

know-how, inventions, discoveries, methods, processes, technical data,
specifications, research and development information, technology, data bases
and other proprietary or confidential information, including customer lists,
which in each case derives economic value (actual or potential) from not
being generally known to other persons who can obtain economic value from its
disclosure (collectively, " _Trade Secrets_ "); and (vi) data base rights,
moral rights, and any other proprietary, intellectual or industrial property
rights of any kind or nature.

  



  

(b) Section 3.15(b)(1) of the Company Letter sets forth an accurate and
complete list of all registered Marks and applications for registration of
Marks owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, "
_Company Registered Marks_ "), Section 3.15(b)(2) of the Company Letter sets
forth an accurate and complete list of all Patents owned by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Company Patents_ ") and Section
3.15(b)(3) of the Company Letter sets forth an accurate and complete list of
all registered Copyrights and all pending applications for registration of
Copyrights owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the
" _Company Registered Copyrights_ " and, together with the Company Registered
Marks and the Company Patents, the " _Company Registered IP_ "). No Company
Registered IP is now involved in any interference, reissue, reexamination,
opposition or cancellation proceeding and, to the knowledge of the Company,
no such action is threatened with respect to any of the Company Registered
IP. The Company Registered IP that is material to the businesses of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as presently conducted is valid,
subsisting and enforceable, and no written notice or claim challenging the
validity or enforceability of any of the Company Registered IP has
been received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, within the prior
three (3) years, excluding any notices or claims that have been fully

  



        
   

  



  

resolved. Other than abandoned patent applications and/or closed
patent applications files (i) the Company has not taken any action or failed
to take any action that would reasonably be expected to result in the
abandonment, cancellation, forfeiture, relinquishment, invalidation or
unenforceability of any of the Company Registered IP, and (ii) all filing,
examination, issuance, post registration and maintenance fees, annuities and
the like associated with or required with respect to any of the Company
Registered IP have been timely paid.

  



  

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable steps
to protect their rights in the Intellectual Property owned by the Company or
its Subsidiaries that is material to the businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as presently conducted, and to maintain the confidentiality of
Trade Secrets of the Company or its Subsidiaries that are material to the
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted. All
current or former employees, consultants and contractors who have
participated in the creation of any Intellectual Property that is used by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in their existing products or in products
currently under development have entered into proprietary information,
confidentiality and assignment agreements substantially in the Companys
standard forms (which have previously been delivered to Buyer) or using
another commercially reasonable form providing for confidentiality, and
assignment to the Company, of such Intellectual Property.

  



  

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries own, or possess adequate licenses or
other valid rights to use, all of the Intellectual Property that is necessary
for the conduct of the Companys and its Subsidiaries businesses and where
the failure to own or possess such licenses or other valid rights to use such
Intellectual Property would have a Material Adverse Effect. Any such license
or other right to Intellectual Property (an " _Inbound License Agreement_ ")
is a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company or its Subsidiaries.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in material default under
any Inbound License Agreement, and none of such Inbound License Agreements
has been cancelled by the other party thereto other than any such defaults or
cancellations that would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Inbound
License Agreement is enforceable and in full force and effect. To the
knowledge of the Company, no party has repudiated any material provision of
any Inbound License Agreement and no event has occurred which, with the
passage of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute a default,
event of default or other breach by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
party thereto which would entitle the other party to an Inbound License
Agreement to terminate the same or declare a default or event of default
thereunder. None of the Intellectual Property owned by the Company or its
Subsidiaries that is material to the businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as presently conducted is subject to any outstanding order,
judgment, or stipulation restricting the use thereof by the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

  



  

(e) Section 3.15 (e) of the Company Letter sets forth, as of the date hereof,
a list of all Inbound License Agreements, other than packaged commercially
available software programs generally available to the public pursuant to
non-exclusive "shrink-wrap" and similar end-user licenses. The rights
licensed under each Inbound License Agreement will be exercisable by the
Surviving Corporation on and after the Closing to the same extent as by the
Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. Any and all license fees,
royalties, or other amounts that have accrued and become due with respect to
any licensed Intellectual Property pursuant to an Inbound License Agreement
have been paid in full. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
granted to any third party any exclusive rights under any Intellectual
Property owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries that is material to the
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted or
otherwise granted any rights under such Intellectual Property outside the
ordinary course of business.

  



        
   

  



  

(f) To the knowledge of the Company, none of the products or services
currently being distributed, sold or offered by the Company and its
Subsidiaries infringes upon, misappropriates or violates in any material
respect any Intellectual Property of any third party and neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries to the Companys knowledge has received any
notice or claim asserting that any such infringement, misappropriation, or
violation has occurred, excluding any notices or claims that have been fully
resolved. To the knowledge of the Company, (i) no third party is
misappropriating, violating or infringing in any material respect any
Intellectual Property owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries that is
material to the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries as presently
conducted, and (ii) no third party has made any unauthorized disclosure of
any Trade Secrets of the Company or its Subsidiaries that are material to the
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted.

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective
Time (the " _Pre-Closing Period_ "), upon reasonable notice, the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries shall afford to Buyer and its accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other representatives of Buyer, reasonable access to
the respective properties, offices, books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, make reasonably available to Buyer all personnel of the
Company or its Subsidiaries knowledgeable about matters relevant to such
inspections as reasonably requested by Buyer; __provided__ ,  _ _however__ ,
that any such access or furnishing of information shall be conducted at
Buyers expense, during normal business hours, under the supervision of the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries personnel and in such a manner as not
unreasonably to interfere with the normal operations of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to disclose
any information to Buyer or its representatives if such disclosure would, in
the Companys reasonable discretion based upon advice of Company outside
counsel, (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege, or (ii)
contravene any Applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date hereof. All information obtained by or on behalf of
Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.1 shall be kept confidential in

  



        
   

  



  

accordance with the letter agreement dated April 10, 2006 between Buyer and
the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  



  

(b) The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, provide Buyer and
its agents and representatives with reasonable access to its employees during
normal working hours following the date of this Agreement, and after
consultation with the Company, among other things, permit Buyer to deliver
offers of continued employment contingent upon Closing and to provide
information to such employees about Buyer; _provided_ , that the Company and
its agents and representatives shall review and approve any such information
to be delivered to such employees and shall be permitted to participate in
any and all such activities.

  



  

(c) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, permit Buyers senior officers to meet with the controller
and other officers of the Company responsible for the Companys financial
statements and the internal controls of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
discuss such matters as Buyer may deem necessary or appropriate for Buyer to
satisfy its obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  



  

 **Section 5.2** ** _Fees and Expenses_. **Whether or not the Merger is
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement in accordance with its terms and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors
and accountants, shall be paid by the party incurring such costs
and expenses, except as otherwise provided in Sections 7.5 and 7.6.

  



  

 **Section 5.3** ** _Superior Proposals; No Solicitation, Etc._**

  



  

(a) Except as permitted under subparagraphs (b) or (e) below, from the date
of this Agreement and until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement
or the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, advisors, agents
and representatives (collectively, the " _Representatives_ ") to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Persons (other than Buyer, Acquisition Sub, and their
respective Representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any Proposal
or Alternative Transaction and request and obtain the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished in
connection therewith. Except as permitted under subparagraphs (b) or (e)
below, the Company will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to, release
any third party from, or waive any rights under, the confidentiality and
stand still provisions of any agreement to which the Company or its
Subsidiaries is a party or becomes a party and will enforce the Companys and
its Subsidiaries rights under such agreements. The Company shall not, nor
shall it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its
Representatives to (directly or indirectly through another person) (i)
solicit, initiate, facilitate or knowingly encourage any Proposal or
any Alternative Transaction, or (ii) enter into or otherwise directly or
indirectly participate in any discussions (other than with Buyer, Acquisition
Sub or their respective Representatives) or negotiations with respect to, or
furnish to any Person any information with respect or in response to, any
Proposal or Alternative Transaction.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.3(a), at any time prior to obtaining Company
Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may, subject to compliance with the
other terms of this Section 5.3, (i) in respect to any tender offer, take and
disclose a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act; (ii) make any other disclosure to the Companys
shareholders when the Company is advised by outside legal counsel that the
failure to make such disclosure is reasonably likely to result in a breach of
the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under

  



        
   

  



  

Applicable Laws and that is not in violation of this Section 5.3(b); and
(iii) in response to a bona fide written Proposal which was made after
the date hereof and did not result from a breach of this Section 5.3, (A)
inform any third party of the terms of this Section 5.3, including making a
copy of this Section 5.3 available to any third party, (B) furnish public or
non-public information with respect to the Company and any Subsidiary to the
Person making the Proposal, subject to first entering into a confidentiality
agreement with the Person making the Proposal (which confidentiality
agreement includes confidentiality provisions no less restrictive than those
attached hereto as _Schedule A_ and provided all such information furnished
to such person has previously been disclosed to Buyer), and (C) participate
in discussions and negotiations with respect to such Proposal if and only to
the extent that, in the case of both clauses (B) and (C), the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that the failure to do so is reasonably likely to result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Laws, and, in the case of
clause (C), the Company Board shall have determined in good faith that such
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal.

  



  

(c) As used in this Agreement:

  



  

(i) " _Alternative Transaction_ " means any of (A) a transaction or series of
transactions pursuant to which any Person (or group of Persons) other than
Parent, Buyer or Acquisition Sub, directly or indirectly, acquires or would
acquire more than fifteen percent (15%) of any class of equity securities of
the Company, whether from the Company or pursuant to a tender offer or
exchange offer or otherwise, (B) any transaction or series of transactions
pursuant to which any Person (or group of Persons) other than Parent, Buyer
or Acquisition Sub acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for
this purpose the outstanding equity securities of any Subsidiary of the
Company) representing more than fifteen percent (15%) of the fair market
value of all the assets, net revenues or net income of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis immediately prior to such transaction or
transactions, or (C) any merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture or similar transaction or series of transactions
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as a result of which the holders of Shares
immediately prior to such transaction or transactions do not, in
the aggregate, own at least eighty-five percent (85%) of the outstanding
shares of capital stock and outstanding voting power of the surviving or
resulting entity in such transaction immediately after the consummation
thereof;

  



  

(ii) " _Proposal_ " means an offer from a third party or parties to enter
into an Alternative Transaction, or any inquiry, proposal or offer that might
reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Transaction; and

  



  

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a proposed Alternative Transaction that
if consummated would result in such third party (or the holders of its
equity) owning, directly or indirectly, more than eighty percent (80%) of the
Shares then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct
or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or
substantially all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, which the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with Raymond James and Associates, Inc., or another financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) (A) to be more favorable to the
shareholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the Merger
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account all
the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and this
Agreement, including any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement
proposed by Buyer in response to such offer or otherwise), and (B) to be
reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial,
legal, regulatory and other aspects of such Alternative Transaction.

  



        
   

  



  

(d) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
Section 5.3, the Company shall promptly (and in no event later than within
twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt of a Proposal notify Buyer orally and
in writing of the receipt of a Proposal, the terms and conditions of any such
Proposal (which shall include any changes thereto and the identity of the
Person making the Proposal) and of any discussions, explorations or
negotiations sought to be entered into or continued by such person with the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their Representatives. The
Company shall provide Buyer with updates on a reasonably current basis, and
in any event at least once every two (2) calendar days, of the status
(including any change to the terms and conditions thereof) of any such
Proposal and any decision to furnish information or participate
in discussions or negotiations as permitted by Section 5.3(b).

  



  

(e) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof will: (i) (A)
withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Buyer) the recommendation by the
Company Board or any such committee in favor of this Agreement and the
Merger, (B) determine that this Agreement or the Merger is no longer
advisable, (C) recommend that the shareholders of the Company reject this
Agreement or the Merger, or (D) resolve, agree or propose publicly to take
any such actions; (ii) adopt or approve (or recommend the adoption or
approval of) any Proposal or Alternative Transaction, or withdraw its
approval of this Agreement or the Merger, or resolve or agree to take
any such actions; (iii) without limiting Section 5.3(e)(i), propose publicly
to adopt or approve any Proposal or Alternative Transaction, or propose

adoption and approval of the Agreement and the approval of the Merger, (B)
reaffirm (publicly, if so requested) its unanimous recommendation in favor of

within five (5) calendar days after Buyer requests in writing that such
unanimous recommendation be affirmed, or (C) send to its security holders
pursuant to Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities Act, within ten (10)
business days after a tender or exchange offer relating to its securities by
a Person is first published, sent or given, a statement disclosing that the
Company Board unanimously recommends rejection of such tender or exchange
offer; or (v) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement, or another agreement constituting
or related to an Alternative Transaction or Proposal (each, an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ ") (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to
in Section 5.3(b)) or resolve or agree to take any such actions (each Company
Board or committee action set forth in clauses (i)-(v) of this Section 5.3(e)
being referred to herein as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "),
unless such Alternative Transaction or Proposal is determined by the Company
Board to constitute a Superior Proposal and the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the
failure to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change is reasonably
likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Laws,
in which case, the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, and may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g) and
substantially concurrently therewith enter into a binding Alternative
Acquisition Agreement containing the terms of a Superior Proposal; _provided,
however,_ that the Company may not exercise its right to effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(g): (x) until after the third (3rd) business day following
Buyers receipt of written notice from the Company advising Buyer that the
Company Board has received a Superior Proposal and that the Company Board
will, subject to any action taken by Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.3(e),
cause the Company to accept such Superior Proposal, which notice shall
specify in reasonable detail the reasons such Superior Proposal is more
favorable to the shareholders of the Company than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to which shall be attached the most
current version of the

  



        
   

  



  

agreement relating to such Superior Proposal (a " _Notice of
Superior Proposal_ ") (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to
the price or any other material term of a Superior Proposal will require a
new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new three (3) day period), and (y)
unless after such third (3rd) business day such Superior Proposal remains a
Superior Proposal after taking into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Buyer in response to such Notice of Superior Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless and until this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with Section 7.1(f) or 7.1(g), nothing in this Section 5.3 will
affect the rights and obligations of the Company and of Parent, Buyer or
Acquisition Sub under any other provision of this Agreement, including the
obligation of the Company to seek the Company Shareholder Approval pursuant
to Section 5.6.

  



  

 **Section 5.4** ** _Cooperation_**.

all commercially reasonable efforts to do the following: (i) cooperate in
the preparation and filing of any filings or notifications that must be made
under the HSR Act or otherwise to any Governmental Entities; (ii) cooperate
in the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, and any amendments
thereto; (iii) obtain consents of all third parties and Governmental Entities
necessary, proper, advisable or reasonably requested by Buyer or the Company,
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
keep Buyer reasonably informed of the status of such consents; and (iv)
contest and/or resolve any legal proceeding relating to the Merger (provided
that if there is or may be a conflict between this clause (iv) and Section
5.4(c), then the provisions of Section 5.4(c) are applicable). If at any time
after the Effective Time any further action is necessary to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each
party hereto shall take all such necessary action.

  



  

(b) Buyer and the Company will reasonably consult and cooperate with one
another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection
with any analyses, appearances, presentations, letters, white papers,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or
relating to any foreign, federal, or state antitrust, competition, or fair
trade law. In this regard, but without limitation, each party hereto shall
inform the other of any material communication between such party and any
Governmental Entity, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice, or any other federal,
foreign or state antitrust or competition Governmental Entity, regarding the
transactions contemplated herein and permit the other party to review in
advance any proposed communication by such party to any such Governmental
Entity. Neither party shall agree to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. The parties will
coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information
and providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods. The parties will provide each other with copies
of all correspondence, filings or written communications between them or any
of their Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or
members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except to the extent such
disclosure would (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal

  



        
   

  



  

privilege, or (ii) contravene any Applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date hereof.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer is and shall
be under no obligation to take any action to resolve any objections, or to
contest, minimize, avoid or eliminate any impediment, so as to obtain
clearance under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation law that may
be raised or asserted by any United States or non-United States governmental,
regulatory or administrative antitrust authority or any other Person that
might prevent the parties from closing the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer need not take or agree
to any action that involves or might involve effecting the sale, divesture or
disposition of any of the assets, properties or businesses of any of Buyer,
any of its affiliates, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or the
imposition of any limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their
businesses or to own or exercise control of such assets and properties.

  



  

 **Section 5.5** ** _Company Stock Options_. **The Company shall, prior to
the Effective Time, take all action necessary to effectuate the treatment of
Company Stock Options set forth in Section 1.10.

  



  

 **Section 5.6** ** _Shareholder Approval; Shareholder Statement_. **Subject
to Section 5.3(e) of this Agreement, the Company shall call and hold a
meeting of its shareholders (the " _Company Shareholder Meeting_ ") for the
purpose of obtaining, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain,
the Company Shareholder Approval. The Company Board will unreservedly and
unanimously recommend that the shareholders of the Company vote in favor of
the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, subject to
Section 5.3(e) of this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 5.7** ** _Public Announcement_. **Buyer and the Company will not
issue any press release with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise issue any written public statements with respect to
such transactions without prior consultation with the other party, except as
may be required by Applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange.

  



  

 **Section 5.8** ** _Notification of Certain Matters_.**

  



  

(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, Buyer shall
use its reasonable efforts to give prompt notice to the Company, and the
Company shall use its reasonable efforts to give prompt notice to Buyer, of:
 (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event of which it is aware and
which would be reasonably likely to cause (A) any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect or (B) any covenant, condition or agreement contained in
this Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied in all material respects,
(ii) any failure of Buyer or the Company in any material respect to comply in
a timely manner with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, or (iii) any change or event
which has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 5.8 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

  



  

(b) The Company shall have the right from time to time prior to the Closing
Date to supplement or amend the Company Letter with respect only to any
event, condition or matter arising after the execution of this Agreement
which, if existing at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
be set forth or described in the Company Letter. Any such supplemental or
amended disclosure shall be deemed to cure any breach of any representation
or warranty made in this Agreement for purposes of determining whether or not
the conditions set forth in Article VI have been

  



        
   

  



  

satisfied; _provided_ that, if such event, condition or matter has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, Buyer shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement by providing written notice of
such termination to the Company within ten (10) days of receipt of such
supplement or amendment. If Buyer fails to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence within such ten (10) day
period, (i) the supplement or amendment shall be deemed accepted by Parent,
Buyer and Acquisition Sub, (ii) any breach of any representation or warranty
made in this Agreement caused by the event, condition or matter disclosed in
the supplement or amendment shall be deemed to have been waived by Parent,
Buyer and Acquisition Sub, and (iii) the Company Letter shall be deemed to be
supplemented or amended in accordance therewith.

  



  

 **Section 5.9** ** _Takeover Statutes_. **If any Takeover Statute is or may
become applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Company and the Company Board shall promptly grant
such approvals and take such lawful actions as are necessary so that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement or by the Merger and otherwise take such
lawful actions to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Takeover Statute
on such transactions.

  



  

 **Section 5.10** ** _Indemnification_.**

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing Parent and Buyer shall assume, be jointly and
severally liable for, and honor, guarantee and stand surety for, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their respective
terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section 5.10, without limit as
to time. After the Effective Time, each of Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation will indemnify and hold harmless (including advancement of
expenses) the current and former directors and officers of the Company in
respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time,
including the authorization of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law or
provided in the Company Charter and any indemnity agreements, all as in
effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that such indemnification shall be
subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under Applicable Law.
Parent and Buyer will cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect
tail coverage that the Company has purchased in connection with the current
policies of the directors and officers liability insurance maintained by
the Company (the " _D andO Insurance_"). If the DandO Insurance cannot
be maintained, expires or is terminated or cancelled during a period of not
less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent, Buyer and
the Surviving Corporation will cause to be obtained as much DandO Insurance
as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an annualized premium
not in excess of twice the amount per annum the Company paid in its last
full fiscal year, on terms and conditions substantially similar to the
existing DandO Insurance.

  



  

(b) In the event Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Section 5.10, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10;
_provided_  that, in the case of any such assignment by Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation, Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall remain
liable for all of their respective obligations under this Agreement. In
addition, if the Surviving Corporation is financially unable to satisfy its
indemnification obligations under this Section 5.10, Buyer shall be deemed to
have assumed and therefore be obligated to discharge such indemnification
obligations to the same extent that the Surviving Corporation is so
obligated.

  



        
   

  



  

 **Section 5.11** ** _Section 16 Matters_. **Buyer, Acquisition Sub and the
Company agree to cooperate fully in the structuring and timing of any
dispositions and acquisitions of equity securities by directors and officers
(as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) of the Company pursuant to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to take, and cause their
respective boards of directors or compensation committees to take, prior to
the Effective Time, any and all such actions as may be reasonably
necessary to afford an exemption from liability under Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act for such acquisitions and dispositions.

  



  

 **Section 5.12** ** _Employee Benefit Matters_.**

  



  

(a) The Surviving Corporation shall provide the Company Employees retained by
the Surviving Corporation with employee benefits no less favorable in the
aggregate than the better of (i) benefits provided to Buyers similarly
situated employees and (ii) benefits provided to Company Employees under the
Company Benefit Plans and Company Benefit Agreements; _provided_ that the
Surviving Corporation shall be under no obligation to retain any
Company Employee or group of Company Employees (subject to Applicable Law and
the severance terms or other provisions of existing employment agreements),
and _provided_ that clause (ii) above shall terminate six (6) months after
the Closing Date. With respect to each employee benefit plan of Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation (collectively, " _Buyer Benefit Plan_ ") in which
Company Employees participate after the Effective Time, for all purposes
(other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan), including
for purposes of entitlement to severance benefits and vacation or other leave
entitlement, service with the Company (or predecessor employers to the extent
the Company provides past service credit) shall be treated as service with
Buyer and the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , that such service shall not
be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits or to the extent that such service was not recognized
under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan, nor shall it be recognized with
respect to any equity incentive award granted on or after the Closing Date.
To the extent (A) permitted by Applicable Law and (B) that Company Employees
are covered by the Buyer Benefit Plan, Buyer shall cause any and all pre-
existing conditions, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under the Buyer Benefit Plan to be waived with respect to such
Company Employees and their eligible dependents and shall provide them with
credit for any co-payments, deductibles, and offsets (or similar payments)
made during the plan year including the Effective Time for the purposes of
satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar requirements
under any Buyer Benefit Plan in which they are eligible to participate after
the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this Section 5.12 with respect to employees are included for the sole benefit
of the respective parties hereto and shall not create any right (i) in any
other person, including any employees, former employees, any participant in
any Company Benefit Plan or any beneficiary thereof or (ii) to continued
employment with the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Buyer. After the
Effective Time, nothing contained in this Section 5.12 shall interfere with
Buyers or the Surviving Corporations right to amend, modify or terminate
any Company Benefit Plan or Buyer Benefit Plan in accordance with Applicable
Law and the terms of such plans, or to terminate the employment of any
employee of the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason. In the
event the Company 401(k) plan is terminated, participants in such plan shall
be offered the opportunity to transfer or make a direct rollover of any
distribution from such Company 401(k) plan into a Buyer Benefit Plan that is
a qualified retirement plan and such transfer or rollover may include
outstanding participant loans (to the extent permitted by such Buyer Benefit
Plan).

Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors or assigns.

  



  

 **Section 8.9** ** _Severability_. **If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law, or public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

take such action.

  



  

 **Section 8.11** ** _Other Remedies; Specific
Performance_**. Notwithstanding the payments provided for in Sections 7.5 and
7.6:

  



  

(a) any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy; and

  



  

(b) the parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached; accordingly, the parties
shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity, and each party hereby waives any requirement to post a bond or
other security in connection with any such proceeding.

 ** _SCHEDULE A_**

  



  

 **Confidentiality Provisions 
 (Section 5.3(b)(ii))**

  



  

You have contacted Fargo Electronics, Inc. (the "Company") concerning your
possible negotiated purchase of all or a portion of the stock, assets
or business of the Company, or any related transactions as may be mutually
agreed between your organization and the Company (the "Possible
Transaction"). You have requested information from the Company in connection
with your consideration of a Possible Transaction with the Company. The Due
Diligence Materials (as defined below) will be provided to you exclusively
for the purpose of evaluating your interest in the Possible Transaction. This
letter confirms the agreement (the "Agreement") between the Company and you
and, based on the following terms and conditions, we are willing to make such
information available to you:

  



  

 ** _Disclosure of Due Diligence Materials_**

  



  

As a condition to our furnishing Due Diligence Materials to you, we
are requiring that you agree, as set forth below, to treat confidentially
such information and any other information that either we or our
representatives furnish to you in connection with the Possible Transaction
involving the Company, whether furnished orally or in writing (whatever the
form or data storage medium) or gathered by inspection and regardless of
whether specifically identified as "confidential", together with all notes,
analyses, compilations, forecasts, studies or other documents or records
prepared by you, or by your directors, officers, agents, representatives
(including attorneys, accountants, lenders and financial advisors) or
employees (collectively the "Representatives") which contain or otherwise
reflect such information or your review of, or interest in, the Company
(collectively, the "Due Diligence Materials"). You recognize and acknowledge
the competitive value of the Due Diligence Materials and the damage that
could result to the Company if the Due Diligence Materials were used or
disclosed except as authorized by this Agreement.

  



  

The term "Due Diligence Materials" does not include information which (i) is
or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of
a disclosure by you or your Representatives in violation of this Agreement
or (ii) was or becomes available to you on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than the Company or its representatives, provided that to your
knowledge such source is not prohibited from disclosing such information to
you by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to the Company or
its representatives.

  



  

 ** _Use of Due Diligence Materials_**

  



  

You agree that the Due Diligence Materials will be used solely for
the purpose of evaluating the Possible Transaction. You agree that the
Due Diligence Materials will be kept strictly confidential by you and
your Representatives; provided, however, that (i) any of such information may
be disclosed to those of your Representatives who need to know such
information for the sole purpose of evaluating the Possible Transaction
between you and the Company (it being understood that such Representatives
shall be informed by you of the confidential nature of such information and
shall be directed by you, and shall each agree to treat such information
confidentially in accordance with this Agreement), and (ii) any other
disclosure of such information may be made if the Company consents in writing
prior to any disclosure. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in
the event that the

        
   

  



  

Possible Transaction is not consummated neither you or your Representatives
shall use any of the Due Diligence Materials for any purpose.

  



  

You will be responsible for any actions by your Representatives (including
your employees who, subsequent to the first date of disclosure of
Due Diligence Materials hereunder, become former employees) inconsistent with
the direction required of you and the agreement required of them pursuant to
clause (i) of the provisos in the preceding paragraph. You agree, at your
sole expense, to take all reasonable measures, including but not limited to
court proceedings, to restrain your Representatives (and former employees)
from unauthorized disclosure or use of the Due Diligence Materials. In
addition, by signing this letter you hereby acknowledge that you are aware
(and that your Representatives who are apprised of this matter have been
advised) that the United States securities laws restrict persons with
material non-public information about a company, obtained directly or
indirectly from that company, from purchasing or selling securities of such
company, or from communicating such information to any other person under
circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is
likely to purchase or sell such securities, and that the Due Diligence
Material may contain material non-public information.

  



  

If at any time you consider a transaction that would involve participation
directly or indirectly by a third party that is not a "Representative" within
the meaning of this Agreement, you agree that such third party will execute a
confidentiality agreement subject to the Companys written approval prior to
disclosure to such party of any Due Diligence Materials.

  



  

 ** _Non-Disclosure of Possible Transaction; Compelled Disclosure_**

  



  

The public disclosure of your potential interest in the Possible Transaction
could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business.
Accordingly, you agree that, without the prior written consent of the
Company, you will not disclose, and will direct your Representatives not to
disclose, to any person other than your Representatives the fact that the Due
Diligence Materials exist or have been provided to you, that you are
considering the Possible Transaction or that discussions or negotiations are
taking place concerning the Possible Transaction, or any of the terms,
conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible transaction,
including, without limitation, the status thereof, unless (i) in the opinion
of your counsel such disclosure is required by you in order that you comply
with any law, order, decree or governmental or stock exchange request and
prior to such disclosure, and as far in advance as is reasonably practicable,
you consult with the Company and its legal counsel concerning the information
you propose to disclose or (ii) such information is made publicly available
other than as a result of wrongful disclosure by you or your Representatives.
The term "person" as used in this Agreement shall be broadly interpreted to
include, without limitation, the news media and any corporation, governmental
agency, partnership, stock exchange, association, group, individual or other
entity.

  



  

In the event that you or any of your Representatives receive a request or are
required (by deposition interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process) to disclose all or any part of the
information contained in the Due Diligence Materials, you or
your Representatives, as the case may be, agree to (i) immediately notify
the Company of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a
request, (ii) consult with the Company on the advisability of taking legally
available steps to resist or narrow such request, and (iii) assist the
Company at the Companys expense in seeking a protective order or other
appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy
is not obtained or that the Company waives compliance with the

        
   

  



  

provisions hereof, you or your Representatives, as the case may be, may
without liability under this Agreement disclose to any tribunal only that
portion of the Due Diligence Materials which you are advised by counsel is
legally required to be disclosed; provided, however, that you give the
Company written notice of the information to be disclosed as far in advance
of its disclosure as is practicable and use your reasonable efforts, at the
Companys expense, to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be
accorded to such information.

  



  

 ** _Return of Documents_**

  



  

Upon the Companys request you and your Representatives shall
promptly deliver to the Company or destroy all written Due Diligence
Materials provided by the Company (whatever the form or data storage medium),
except for that portion of the Due Diligence Materials that consists of or
contains notes, analyses compilations, forecasts, studies or other documents
or records prepared by or on behalf of you or your Representatives, which
will continue to be subject to the terms of this Agreement. Compliance with
this paragraph shall be certified in writing to the Company by an authorized
officer supervising the return or destruction of written materials pursuant
hereto. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Due Diligence
Materials, you and your Representatives will continue to be bound by your
obligations of confidentiality and other obligations hereunder.
