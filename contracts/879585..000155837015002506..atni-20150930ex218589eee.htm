 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Buyer's Calculation.Within 60 days after the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Parent the Buyer's determination of (i) the
Net Working Capital Amount, (ii) Available Cash as of the Closing Date, (iii)

accounting methods, policies, principles, practices and procedures, with
consistent classifications, judgments and estimation methodology as set forth
in the Plan of Record and on Schedule 1.B, Schedule 1.C and Schedule 1.D, as
applicable. The Buyer will make available to Parent and its auditors,
employees and advisors all records and work papers used in preparing the
Buyer's Computation and will prepare and deliver to Parent a reasonably
detailed analysis of the changes supporting any variances between the Buyer's
determination of the components thereof and the corresponding estimates of
such amounts as determined by the Sellers pursuant to Section 2.02(b). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Methodology. The parties agree that the purpose of preparing the
Sellers' Computation and the Buyer's Computation and determining the
components thereof and the related Seller Proceeds adjustment contemplated by
this Section 2.05 is to measure the amount of any changes in the Net Working
Capital Amount, Available Cash as of the Closing Date, Closing Indebtedness,
Closing Count and related Plan of Record Adjustment, Title Exceptions
Adjustment, Closing Pension/OPEB Shortfall and Closing Transaction Costs and
such processes \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Parent's Objection. If Parent disagrees with any aspect of the
Buyer's Computation, Parent may, within 60 days after receipt of the Buyer's
Computation, deliver a notice (an "Objection Notice") to the Buyer setting
forth Parent's objection in reasonable detail and the Parent's determination
of the Net Working Capital Amount, Available Cash as of the Closing Date,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Count and related Plan of Record Adjustment,
Title Exceptions Adjustment, Closing Pension/OPEB Shortfall and Closing
Transaction Costs and Parent's calculation of the Purchase Price and Seller
Proceeds resulting therefrom, together with all supporting documentation. If
Parent does not deliver an Objection Notice to the Buyer within 60 days after
receipt of the Buyer's Computation, then the parties hereto will be deemed to
have agreed to the Buyer's Computation and the components of such Buyer's
Computation shall be deemed to be finally determined as set forth
therein. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)Resolution of Disagreements. The Buyer and Parent shall use
reasonable efforts to resolve any disagreements as to the Buyer's Computation
and the Objection Notice, but if they do not obtain a final resolution within
30 days after the Buyer has received the Objection Notice, the Buyer and
Parent shall jointly retain Ernst and Young LLP or other accounting firm of
national reputation mutually acceptable to the Buyer and Parent (the "Firm")
to resolve any remaining disagreements. The Buyer and Parent shall direct the
Firm to render a determination within 30 days after its retention and the
Buyer, Parent and their respective agents shall cooperate with the Firm during
its engagement. The Firm will act as an expert and not as an arbitrator in
conducting its analysis and may consider only those items and amounts in the
Buyer's Computation or Objection Notice which the Buyer and Parent are unable
to resolve. In resolving any disputed item, the Firm may not assign a value to
any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party
or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The
Firm's determination shall be based solely on written submissions by the Buyer
and Parent (i.e., not on independent review) and on the definitions,
principles, methodologies and standards included herein. The determination of
the Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the Buyer and Parent. Until the
Firm makes its determination, the costs and expenses of the Firm shall be
borne equally by the Buyer, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand;
provided that, when the Firm makes its determination, any costs and expenses
(including costs and expenses previously advanced) of the Firm that are
allocable to the party whose determination of the Purchase Price in its
original submission to the Firm was closest to the Firm's determination of the
same shall be paid by the other party, it being agreed among the parties that
the Buyer and Parent shall bear the Firm's costs and expenses equally if their
respective determinations are equidistant from the Firm's determination. \t\t

then within five Business Days after the determination thereof, Parent shall
pay to the Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount
equal to such excess plus simple interest thereon, at an interest rate equal
to 4%, from the Closing Date to the date of payment, computed on an annual
basis using a 360-day year. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii)If the Seller Proceeds as finally determined pursuant to Sections
2.05(d) is equal to the Seller Proceeds set forth in Sellers' Computation,
then there shall be no other adjustment to Seller Proceeds pursuant to this
Section 2.05, except as provided in Section 2.05(f). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f)Rate Adjustment. If the Rate Adjustment occurs prior to the
Closing, then the Sellers shall include such amount in the Sellers'
Computation using the same accounting methods, policies, principles, practices
and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and estimation
methodology, as are reflected on Schedule 1.C. If occurring after the Closing,
then within ten Business Days after the final determination of the Rate
Adjustment, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Parent the Buyer's
calculation of the Purchase Price and Seller Proceeds resulting therefrom, as
determined by using the same accounting methods, policies, principles,
practices and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and
estimation methodology, as are reflected on Schedule 1.C. Such calculations
and resulting by either party and the resulting adjustments to the Purchase
Price and Seller Proceeds shall be subject to the procedures, methodologies
and payment mechanics set forth in this Section 2.05 mutatis mutandis, subject
to differences in the timing of Buyer's delivery of its initial
calculation. \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

Law. All such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the recipient in respect of which such
withholding was made. \t\t

Company's Knowledge, any other party thereto is in breach or default
thereunder and, to the Knowledge of Sellers, no event has occurred which, with
notice or the lapse of time, or both, would constitute a breach or default or
permit termination, modification or acceleration thereunder. The Company or a
Seller Entity is in actual possession of the leased premises under the Real
Property Leases. The Company or a Seller Entity has paid or cause to be paid
the rent set forth in the Real Property Leases on a current basis and there

Entity party thereto is in material default under any Real Property Lease,
which has not been cured. Nor, during the last two years, has the Company or
any Seller Entity received any written notice from any easement grantor
requesting removal of equipment or other personal property. Neither the
Company nor any Seller Entity nor, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, any other
party to a Real Property Lease has violated in any material respect any
provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under the provisions
of such Real Property Lease. \t\t

Property Leases (the "Leased Real Properties"), free and clear of all Liens
other than Permitted Liens. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10(c)(ii), no
Leased Real Property is subject to any sublease, sublicense or other agreement
granting to any other Person any right to use, occupancy or enjoyment of such
property or any portion thereof. Except for Permitted Liens, the Sellers have
no Knowledge of any impediment to the right of the Company or Seller Entity,
as applicable, to quiet enjoyment of each of the Leased Real Properties for
the full term of the applicable Real Property Lease (and any renewal option(s)
contained therein). Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10(c)(iii), the Company
and the Seller Entities are not parties to any agreement governing or
affecting the occupancy or tenancy of any of the Leased Real Property by any
Person other than the Company or a Seller Entity. Since the Reference Date,

effect) that the whole nor any part of any Real Property or Leased Real
Property is subject to any pending suit for condemnation or other taking by
any Government Authority, and, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, no such
condemnation or other taking is threatened. The current use, occupancy and
operation of the Real Property and the premises leased pursuant to the Real
Property Leases by the Company and the Seller Entities is (i) in

reasonably expects to incur any material liability under Title IV of ERISA

premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation with respect to such

occurrence and identify the Persons, circumstances and all relevant terms
involved. Without limiting the foregoing, any violation of the restrictions

respect to Owned Real Property, it shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the same as soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement and, with respect to any such title commitments or title policies
which reflect Exceptions, will deliver the same to Sellers promptly following
receipt thereof. \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)If any title commitment or any title policy obtained by Buyer
discloses any Lien, mortgage, judgement or other encumbrance affecting any
parcel of Owned Real Property (collectively, "Exceptions"), other than the
Permitted Liens, then, with respect to each such Exception, Sellers shall take
such action as is required to have such Exception removed by the title
company, which action may include the payment of a liquidated sum of money,
the delivery of an affidavit and/or the delivery of an indemnity, in each
case, as reasonably requested by Buyer\'s title company; provided, that, (i)
if such Exception may be satisfied by the payment of a liquidated sum of money
then, in lieu of such removal, (A) such liquidated sum shall be reflected on
the Flow of Funds and paid from the Estimated Purchase Price, or (B) the
Purchase Price will be reduced, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by the amount of
such liquidated sum, and (ii) if such Exception has not been reduced to a
liquidated sum and is not material, Sellers failure to remove said Exception
shall not be considered a breach of this Section 6.05(b). \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.07 Straddle Period Taxes. For purposes of this Agreement,

case of Taxes based upon, or related to, income or receipts, or imposed in
connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or
personal, tangible or intangible) (other than conveyances pursuant to this
Agreement), on the basis of a "closing of the books" as of the beginning of,
but not including, the Closing Date; and (ii)in the case of other Taxes,
amounts allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of days in the entire period. \t\t

prepared in accordance with past practice and custom of the Company and the
Seller Entities. The Buyer shall be responsible for preparing any Tax Returns
with respect to the Company and the Seller Entities for any Straddle Periods
and for taxable years beginning and ending after the Closing Date. For any Tax
Return filed by Parent after the Closing Date, Parent shall make such Tax
Returns available for review by the Buyer no less than 15 days in advance of
the due date for filing such Tax Returns, and shall cause any reasonable
comments of the Buyer to be reflected in such Tax Return, and Buyer and Parent
shall work together to resolve any disagreement regarding the Tax Returns;
provided, however, that if any disagreements are not resolved prior to the due
date of a Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by Parent and
such disagreement shall be resolved by the Firm and any determination of the
Firm will be final. Parent shall pay to Buyer on or before the due date of
such Tax Return any Tax Liability shown as due thereon, but only to the extent
such Tax Liability exceeds the amount of such Tax Liability included in the
determination of Net Working Capital and taken into account as an adjustment
to the purchase price hereunder. For all Straddle Period Tax Returns, Buyer
shall make such Tax Returns available to Parent no less than 15 days in
advance of the due for filing such Tax Returns, together with a statement
showing the computation of the Tax Liability of the Company or Seller Entities
(as the case may be) for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on or
before the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Period") and for the portion of
the Straddle Period ending after the Closing Date (the "Statement"). Buyer
shall cause any reasonable comments of Parent to be reflected in such Tax
Return. Parent shall pay to Buyer on or before the due date of the Straddle
Period Tax Return any Tax Liability attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
reflected on the Statement to Buyer, but only to the extent such Tax Liability
for the Pre-Closing Tax Period exceeds the amount of such Tax Liability
included in the determination of Net Working Capital and taken into account as
an adjustment to the purchase price hereunder. In the event of any
disagreement between the Buyer and Parent regarding such Tax Returns or the
Statement, such disagreement shall be resolved by the Firm and any such
determination by the Firm shall be conclusive and final. The fees and expenses
of the Firm shall be borne equally by the Buyer and Parent. Unless otherwise
required by Applicable Law, Buyer shall not amend any Tax Return of the Seller
Entities or the Company for any taxable period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date or amend or revoke any Tax elections of the Seller Entities or
the Company if such amendment or revocation would impact the Tax Liability of
the Seller Entities or the Company for any such taxable periods. \t\t

among the Company's assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder (the "Section 1060 Allocation"). If, within 30
days after delivery of the Allocation Statement, the Buyer notifies Parent in
writing that the Buyer objects to the allocation set forth in the Allocation
Statement, Parent and the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve such dispute within 20 days. In the event the Buyer and Parent are
unable to resolve such dispute within 20 days, the Buyer and Parent shall file
their Tax Returns in accordance with their own determinations as to the
correct allocation. The parties agree to amend the Section 1060 Allocation as
necessary to reflect any adjustments in consideration agreed upon, or payments
made, after the Closing Date. Except as otherwise provided in this Section
8.09, the Buyer and Parent further agree to file, and \t\t

the case may be, from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Governmental Authority based on the Allocation Statement and neither the Buyer
nor Parent will be required to litigate any proposed adjustment by any
Governmental Authority challenging such Allocation Statement. Any refund
received by the Seller Entities for periods prior to the Closing Date or any
portion of a Straddle Period prior to the Closing Date shall be paid to
Parent, except to the extent such refund was taken into account as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price hereunder. \t\t

Claims. \t\t

"Third Party Claim") that results, or might upon the resolution of such Third
Party Claim result in, Losses for which any Person entitled to indemnification
under Section 11.02 (the "Indemnitee") is entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this Agreement, such Indemnitee shall promptly provide notice of such Third
Party Claim to the parties from whom such indemnification could be sought (the
"Indemnitors") (provided that failure to so notify the Indemnitors will only
relieve the indemnification obligation if and to the extent such failure
results in material prejudice with respect to such Third Party Claim) and

Agent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

  \t\t\t- 66 -  \t\t (without regard to any threshold or limitation contemplated by Section
11.02(a) or (b), as the case may be), assume the defense of the Indemnitee
against such Third Party Claim (including the employment of counsel reasonably
acceptable the Indemnitee and the payment of reasonable expenses). Any
Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such Third
Party Claim and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall not be an expense of the Indemnitor unless (i)
the Indemnitor shall have failed, within a reasonable time after having been
notified by the Indemnitee of the existence of such Third Party Claim as
provided in the preceding sentence, to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim or (ii) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized
by the Indemnitor. If (i) the Indemnitor does not assume such defense, or
notifies the Indemnitee within 30 days after the date notice is provided
pursuant to Section 11.04(a) that the Indemnitor does not assume such defense,
(ii) the Indemnitor having assumed such defense but failed to contest such
Third Party Claim in good faith with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to
Indemnitee (and Indemnitee's consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), then the Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the obligation
(upon delivering notice to such effect to the Indemnitor) to retain separate
counsel of its choosing, defend such Third Party Claim and have the sole power
to direct and control such defense (all at the reasonable cost and expense of
the Indemnitor); it being understood that the Indemnitee's right to
indemnification for a Third Party Claim shall not be adversely affected by
assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim. In all cases, the party
without the right to control the defense of the Third Party Claim may retain
counsel of its choice at its own expense, and may participate in the defense
of such Third Party Claim. \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Notwithstanding Section 11.04(b) above, if, with respect to a Third
Party Claim: (i) such Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or other equitable
remedies other than monetary damages in respect of the Indemnitee or its
business; (ii) such Third Party Claim is reasonably likely to result in
liabilities that, taken with other then existing claims under this Article 11,
will not be fully indemnified hereunder; (iii) the Indemnitee has been advised
by counsel in writing that an actual or potential conflict exists between the
Indemnitee and the Indemnitor in connection with the defense of the Third
Party Claim; (iv) such Third Party Claim involves a Permit or Governmental
Authority; or (v) such Third Party Claim seeks a finding or admission of a
violation of Applicable Law by the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, then,
in each such case (A) the Indemnitee alone shall be entitled, but not
obligated, to contest and defend, such Third Party Claim in the first
instance, with counsel of its choosing and reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Parties, at the expense of the Indemnifying Parties; it being
understood that the Indemnitee's right to indemnification for a Third Party
Claim shall not be adversely affected by assuming the defense of such Third
Party Claim, and (B) if the Indemnitee does not contest and defend such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall then have the right to contest and defend
such Third Party Claim. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)The Indemnitee and the Indemnitor shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with
Applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and
others representing any party to a Third Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.04 to the contrary,
neither the Indemnitor nor the Indemnitee may, without the written consent of
the other party, which \t\t

judgment, or consent to entry of any judgment. If a settlement offer solely
for money damages is made by the applicable third- party claimant, and the
Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee in writing of the Indemnitor's willingness
to accept the settlement offer and pay the amount called for by such offer
without reservation of any rights or defenses against the Indemnitee, the
Indemnitee may decline to accept the settlement offer and may continue to
contest such claim, free of any participation by the Indemnitor, and the
amount of any ultimate Liability with respect to such Third Party Claim that
the Indemnitor has an obligation to pay under this Agreement will be limited
to the lesser of (i) the amount of the settlement offer that the Indemnitee
declined to accept plus the Losses of the Indemnitee relating to such Third
Party Claim incurred with respect to costs and expenses of investigation,
collection, prosecution, determination and defense thereof (including
reasonable legal, accounting and other professional fees) through the date of
its rejection of the settlement offer, or (ii) the aggregate Losses of the
Indemnitee with respect to such Third Party Claim. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f)Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 11.04 to the
contrary, for (i) any matter identified on Schedule 3.06 and identified with
an asterisk (*) (each, a "Tax Claim"), and (ii) any Action or other matter set
forth on Schedule 3.07 that remains open after the Closing (collectively with
the Tax Claims, the "Retained Litigation"), (A) Parent shall control,
prosecute and defend against, the Retained Litigation on behalf of the Company
and the Seller Entities, including, without limitation, any settlement of the
Retained Litigation; provided, that, no compromise or settlement of the
Retained Litigation may be effected without the written consent of Buyer (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed provided that
such compromise or settlement involves the payment of money damages only and
includes mutual general releases), (B) Parent shall actively and diligently
conduct the prosecution or defense, as applicable, of the Retained Litigation,
(C) Parent shall keep the Buyer reasonably informed as to the status of the
Retained Litigation (including, without limitation, by participating in
monthly meetings with Buyer to discuss status and strategy) and copy Buyer on
all correspondence relating thereto, (D) Buyer shall be entitled to
participate in, and be present at, conference calls and meetings concerning
the Retained Litigation, and (E) the Buyer shall be entitled to retain
separate legal counsel and other advisors for purposes of keeping itself
reasonably apprised as to the rights and obligations of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties with respect to the Retained Litigation, and the Buyer shall bear all
of the costs and expenses of such counsel and other advisors. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.05 Non-Third Party Claims. If a claim for Losses (a
"Claim") is to be made by any Indemnitee that does not involve a third party,
such Indemnitee shall give written notice (a "Claim Notice") to the Parent if
the Claim Notice is being given by a Buyer Indemnified Party and to Buyer and
Buyer Parent if the Claim Notice is being given by a Seller Indemnified Party,
in each case, promptly after such Indemnitee becomes aware of any fact,
condition or event giving rise to Losses for which indemnification may be
sought under Section 11.02(a) or 11.02(b), which Claim Notice shall specify
in reasonable detail, to the extent reasonably practicable at such time, the
amount of the Claim and the Losses included in the amount so stated, the date
(if any) such item was incurred or suffered, the basis for any anticipated
liability and the nature of the misrepresentation, default, breach of warranty
or breach of covenant or claim to which each such item is related. The failure
of any Indemnitee to give timely notice hereunder shall not affect such
Indemnitee's rights to indemnification hereunder, \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t- 68 -  \t\t delay or failure, and the amount of reimbursement to which the Indemnitee is
entitled shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Indemnitee's
Losses would have been less had such Claim Notice been timely given. If the
applicable Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee that it does not dispute the
claim described in such Claim Notice or fails to respond within 30 days
following receipt of such Claim Notice, the Losses identified in the Claim
Notice will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnitor under Section
11.02(a) or 11.02(b), as applicable. If the applicable Indemnitor disputes its
liability with respect to such Claim or the estimated amount of such Losses
pursuant to this Section 11.05, the parties shall attempt in good faith to
resolve such dispute; provided, that if such dispute has not been resolved
within 90 days following receipt of such Claim Notice, then the Indemnitor and
the Indemnitee may seek legal redress in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.06 Adjustments; Subrogation; Regarding the Net Working
Capital Amount. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)For purposes of calculating amounts recoverable from an Indemnitor,
Losses will be measured net of any amounts actually recovered (and not simply
recoverable) after deducting collection costs and expenses, including any
deductible amount, and any resultant increase in insurance premiums, by the
Indemnitee for the Losses for which such indemnification payment is payable
under any insurance policy, warranty or indemnity from any third party (each
such source, a "Collateral Source"). In the event that a recovery or payment
from a Collateral Source is received by an Indemnitee with respect to any Loss
for which any such Indemnitee has been indemnified by any Indemnitor
hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery (after
deducting collection costs and expenses, including any deductible amount, and
any resultant increase in insurance premiums), up to the amount paid by the
Indemnitor to the Indemnitee, shall be made promptly by such Indemnitee to
such Indemnitor. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
all such amounts actually recovered shall count against the Deductible. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)If (i) Indemnitee is a Buyer Indemnified Party and (ii) a Loss is
covered by a Seller Insurance Policy, Indemnitee shall seek full recovery and
payment of such Loss from such Seller Insurance Policy to the same extent as
it would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. The Buyer
and the Company shall not terminate or cancel any Seller Insurance Policy. For
purposes hereof, "Seller Insurance Policy" means any insurance policy in
effect for periods prior to the Closing to the extent the premiums therefor
have been paid in full by the Company or a Seller Entity prior to the
Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)All indemnification payments made hereunder shall be treated by all
parties as adjustments to the Purchase Price. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article
11, there shall be no recovery for any Loss or alleged Loss by the Buyer under
Section 11.02, and the Loss shall not be included in meeting the Deductible
hereunder, to the extent such item has been included in the calculation of the
Net Working Capital Amount, including reserves and accruals, as determined
pursuant to Section 2.05. \t\t

to any Losses as a result of or in connection with any misrepresentation or
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, then (without limiting any of the rights of the Company or Seller
Entity as an Indemnitee) Buyer shall also be deemed, by virtue of its
ownership of the Membership Interest, to have incurred Losses as a result of
and in connection with such misrepresentation, inaccuracy or breach. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.03 Construction; Severability. The language used in this
Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to
express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be
applied against any Person. The headings of the sections and paragraphs of
this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall
in no way restrict or otherwise modify any of the terms or provisions hereof.
Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in
such manner as to be effective and valid under Applicable Law, but if any
provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under
Applicable Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such
provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement. Unless otherwise
indicated, references in this Agreement to $ or dollars are to U.S. dollars.
The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of like import used in
this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole (including all of the
Schedules and Exhibits) and not to any particular provision of this Agreement
unless otherwise specified. The words "party" or "parties" shall refer to

 \t\t\tSection 12.04 Expenses. Except as set forth in Section 8.02(e), all

and expenses associated with the consents, approvals, Filings, waivers or
concessions required from any Person other than any Governmental Authority and
set forth on Schedule 3.03(c) shall be borne exclusively by the Parent. All
Transaction Costs which are incurred by the Company and the Seller Entities
and which remain unpaid as of the Closing Date will be paid at the Closing as
Closing Transaction Costs. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, all fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent shall be borne
50% by Buyer, on the one hand, and 50% by the Company prior to Closing (and

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.05 Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns; provided that no party may
assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under
this Agreement without the consent of each other party hereto. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Buyer may, without the prior written consent of any other
party hereto, (i) assign any or all of its rights hereunder to one or more of
Buyer Parent's wholly- owned subsidiaries that are entities formed and
existing in the United States, (ii) designate one or more of Buyer Parent's
wholly-owned subsidiaries that are entities formed and existing in the United
States to perform its obligations hereunder, (iii) assign any or all of its
rights to any Person that acquires all or substantially all of the business of
the Buyer, and (iv) assign any or all of its rights hereunder to one or more
financing sources; provided, that such assignment is not reasonably expected
to have an adverse effect or delay on any Communications Regulatory Authority
Consent; and, provided, further, that Buyer Parent may not assign its
obligations under Article 4 without the Parent's prior written consent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement
and the exhibits and Schedules hereto shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the United States applicable thereto and the
internal laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of
law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware
or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.07 Jurisdiction; Venue. All Actions arising out of or
relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined in any state or
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware. Each of the parties to this
Agreement irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.09 Specific Performance, Remedies Not Exclusive. The
parties acknowledge that the Buyer and Buyer Parent, on the one hand, and the
Sellers, on the other hand, would be irreparably damaged if the provisions of
this Agreement are not performed by the other parties hereto in accordance
with their specific terms and that any breach of this Agreement by a party
could not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone.
Accordingly, the Buyer and Buyer Parent (in the event of such a breach by the
Sellers) and the Sellers (in the event of such a breach by the Buyer or Buyer
Parent) shall be entitled to a decree of specific performance pursuant to
which the Buyer and Buyer Parent or the Sellers, respectively, are ordered to
affirmatively carry out their obligations under this Agreement, whether before
or after the Closing, and each party hereto hereby waives any defense to the
effect that a remedy at law would be an adequate remedy for such breach. Any
requirements for the securing or posting of any bond by a party hereto with
such equitable remedy are hereby waived. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.10 Prevailing Party. If any litigation or other court
action, arbitration or similar adjudicatory proceeding is commenced by any
party hereto to enforce its rights under this Agreement against any other
party, all fees, costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and court costs, incurred by the prevailing party in such
litigation, action, arbitration or proceeding shall be reimbursed by the
losing party; provided, that if a party to such litigation, action,
arbitration or proceeding prevails in part, and loses in part, the court,
arbitrator or other adjudicator presiding over such litigation, action,
arbitration or proceeding shall award a reimbursement of the fees, costs and
expenses incurred by such party on an equitable basis. \t\t

may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an
original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each
party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
parties hereto. Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, no
provision of this Agreement (including specifically, but not limited to,
Sections 7.02, 11.01, 11.02 and 11.03) is intended to confer upon any Person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. \t\t
