ARTICLE II.

 

THE ACQUISITION

2.1.  _Purchase and Sale of the Purchased Units at Closing_.

(a) Purchaser and each of the Sellers, severally and not jointly,
hereby agrees that upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver,
if permissible, of the conditions hereof, at the Closing, Purchaser shall
purchase from each Seller Subsidiary, and each Seller Subsidiary shall sell,
transfer and deliver to Purchaser, all of the Units owned by such Seller
Subsidiary, in each case free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than those
set forth in the Certificate of Formation or the LLC Agreement and under
applicable securities Laws). The aggregate purchase price to be paid by
Purchaser for the Purchased Units (the " _Purchase Price_ ") shall be
$1,827,800,000, as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.3 and Section 2.4, less any
amounts paid to Purchaser in accordance with  _Article IX_ and the Escrow
Agreement.

 



\- 11 - (b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall (i) pay to each Seller such Sellers Pro
Rata Share of $1,827,800,000, as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)(i)_
and _Section 2.4(b)(i)_, minus such Sellers Pro Rata Share of the Escrow
Amount (the " _Initial Purchase Price_ "), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the bank account of each Seller specified by
such Seller to Purchaser at least three Business Days prior to the Closing,
and (ii) pay to the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the bank account of the Escrow Agent
designated in the Escrow Agreement.

2.2. _The Closing_. The Closing shall take place at the offices of Nixon
Peabody LLP in Washington, D.C. at 10:00 a.m. local time on October 1, 2014
or, if all of the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article VII_ (other
than those that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) have not been
satisfied one Business Day prior to such date, on the fourth Business Day
after the date on which all of the conditions to the Closing set forth in 
_Article VII_ (other than those that by their terms are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions)
have been met (the " _Closing_ "). The date on which the Closing is held
is sometimes referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_." The Closing shall
be effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date (the " _Effective Time_ ").
All transactions at the Closing shall be deemed to take place simultaneously,
and no transaction shall be deemed to have been completed and no documents or
certificates shall be deemed to have been delivered until all other
transactions are completed and all other documents and certificates are
delivered. 

2.3. _Working Capital Adjustment_.

 

(a) _Balance Sheet Test_. The Sellers and Purchaser agree that the Purchase
Price will be adjusted as of the Effective Time such that (i) if at the
Effective Time the Closing Date Net Working Capital is more than the Target,
the Purchase Price will be increased by 73.1% of the amount of such excess and
(ii) if at the Effective Time the Closing Date Net Working Capital is less
than the Target, the Purchase Price will be reduced by 73.1% of the amount of
such shortfall. Attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ is an example of a Closing Date
Balance Sheet, including a calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital
as of June 30, 2014, based on the Companys balance sheet as of such date,
which is included solely to illustrate the Parties intentions regarding the
provisions of this _Section 2.3_.

 

(b) _Adjustment Calculations_. The Estimated Net Working Capital and Closing
Date Net Working Capital will be calculated as follows:

 

(i) The Company and the Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser not less than two
Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date an estimated balance
sheet of the Company prepared as of the Effective Time, which shall be
reflected on a preliminary statement consented to by Purchaser (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , that
if such consent has been withheld and no agreement between the Sellers and
Purchaser can be reached after good faith negotiations during such period, the
estimated balance sheet as initially delivered shall be used for purposes of
this  _Section 2.3(b)(i)_) (the " _Preliminary Balance Sheet_ ") that sets
forth a good faith estimate of the Closing Date Net Working Capital (including
the effect of the Pre-Closing Distribution) (the " _Estimated Net Working
Capital_ "), which Preliminary Balance Sheet and Estimated Net Working Capital
shall

 



\- 12 -  be prepared and calculated on a basis consistent with the preparation and
calculation of the example set forth in _Exhibit C_ (so long as such
preparation and calculation is in accordance with the definition of Closing
Date Net Working Capital). If the Estimated Net Working Capital is less than
the Target, the Initial Purchase Price payable at the Closing as provided in
_Section 2.1(b)_ shall be reduced by 73.1% of the amount of such difference.
If the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than the Target, the Initial
Purchase Price payable at Closing as provided in _Section 2.1(b)_ shall be
increased by 73.1% of the amount of such difference.

 

(ii) Within 120 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser will prepare and
deliver to the Sellers the balance sheet of the Company prepared as of the
Effective Time, which shall be reflected on a statement (the " _Closing Date
Balance Sheet_ ") that sets forth the Closing Date Net Working Capital, which
Closing Date Balance Sheet and Closing Date Net Working Capital shall
be prepared and calculated on a basis consistent with the preparation and
calculation of the example set forth in _Exhibit C_ (so long as such
preparation and calculation is in accordance with the definition of Closing
Date Net Working Capital), and showing the recalculation, if any, of
adjustments reflected on the Preliminary Balance Sheet. The Sellers shall have
60 days to review the Closing Date Balance Sheet. The Sellers shall be deemed
to have accepted the determination set forth in the Closing Date Balance
Sheet, which shall be final and binding on all Parties, unless within 60 days
after receipt of the Closing Date Balance Sheet the Required Sellers notify
Purchaser in writing of the Required Sellers objection to the Closing Date
Balance Sheet, which notice shall set forth the Required Sellers proposed
Closing Date Balance Sheet (the " _Objection Notice_ "). If the Required
Sellers timely provide an Objection Notice, Purchaser shall promptly meet
with Representatives of the Required Sellers and attempt in good faith to
reach a resolution of such disagreement. If any such dispute cannot be
resolved by Purchaser and the Required Sellers within 30 days after the
delivery of the Objection Notice, the dispute shall be referred to the
Accounting Firm. The Required Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the
other hand, each shall submit its determination of the Closing Date Balance
Sheet to the Accounting Firm and all work papers and back-up materials
relating thereto requested by the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall
be authorized to resolve only those items in dispute within the range of the
difference between the Required Sellers determination of the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and Purchasers determination of the Closing Date Balance Sheet.
The Parties shall cause the Accounting Firm to make a determination within 30
days after submission of the dispute to the Accounting Firm.
The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on each
Party, including all of the Sellers. The fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm shall be split equally between Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Sellers in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, on the other hand.
Purchaser and the Sellers agree that the procedure set forth in this _Section
2.3(b)_ for resolving disputes with respect to the Closing Date Balance Sheet
shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any such disputes;
_provided_ , that this provision shall not prohibit Purchaser or the Sellers
from instituting litigation to enforce the determination of the Accounting
Firm.

 

(c) _Mechanics_. If on the date on which the Closing Date Balance Sheet is
finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)(ii)_ the Closing Date Net
Working Capital set forth on such final Closing Date Balance Sheet is more
than the Estimated Net Working Capital, Purchaser shall, within three Business
Days, pay to the Sellers, by wire transfer or other delivery of immediately
available funds to the bank accounts of the Sellers specified by the Sellers,
an amount equal to each Sellers Pro Rata Share of 73.1% of such difference,
and if on the date on

 



\- 13 -  which the Closing Date Balance Sheet is finally determined pursuant to
_Section 2.3(b)(ii)_, the Closing Date Net Working Capital set forth on such
final Closing Date Balance Sheet is less than the Estimated Net Working
Capital, the Escrow Agent shall, within three Business Days, release 73.1% of
such difference to Purchaser from each Sellers Escrow Account in accordance
with each Sellers Pro Rata Share pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, and the Sellers agree to provide written instructions to the Escrow
Agent for the release of such amount to Purchaser.

 

2.4. _Adjustments to the Purchase Price Based on Closing Indebtedness and
Closing Expenses_.

 

(a) _Adjustment_. The Sellers and Purchaser agree that the Purchase Price will
be adjusted as of the Effective Time to be reduced (i) by 73.1% of the amount
of any Closing Indebtedness and (ii) dollar for dollar by the amount of
Closing Expenses.

(b)  _Adjustment Calculations_. The Closing Indebtedness and Closing Expenses
will be calculated as follows:

(i) The Company and the Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser not less than two
Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date an estimated calculation
of the amount of Closing Indebtedness and Closing Expenses as of the Effective
Time, which shall be reflected on a preliminary statement consented to by
Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; _provided_ , that if such consent has been withheld and no agreement
between the Sellers and Purchaser can be reached after good faith
negotiations during such period, the calculations as initially delivered shall
be used for purposes of this _Section 2.4(b)(i)_) (the " _Preliminary
Adjustment Calculation_ ") that sets forth good faith estimates of the
Closing Indebtedness and Closing Expenses and the resulting adjustment
calculated in accordance with _Section 2.4(a)_ (the " _Estimated Adjustment_
"). The Initial Purchase Price payable at the Closing as provided in _Section
2.1(b)_ shall be reduced by the Estimated Adjustment.

(ii) Within 120 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser will prepare and
deliver to the Sellers its calculation (the " _Closing Adjustment Calculation_
") of the Closing Indebtedness and Closing Expenses as of the Effective Time
and showing the recalculation, if any, of adjustments reflected on the
Preliminary Adjustment Calculation, in each case calculated in accordance with
_Section 2.4(a)_. The Sellers shall have 60 days to review the Closing
Adjustment Calculation. The Sellers shall be deemed to have accepted
the determination set forth in the Closing Adjustment Calculation, which
shall be final and binding on all Parties, unless within 60 days after receipt
of the Closing Adjustment Calculation the Required Sellers notify Purchaser in
writing of the Required Sellers objection to the Closing Adjustment
Calculation, which notice shall set forth the Required Sellers proposed
Closing Adjustment Calculation (the " _Adjustment Objection Notice_ "). If the
Required Sellers timely provide an Adjustment Objection Notice, Purchaser
shall promptly meet with Representatives of the Required Sellers and attempt
in good faith to reach a resolution of such disagreement. If any such dispute
cannot be resolved by Purchaser and the Required Sellers within 30 days after
the delivery of the Adjustment Objection Notice, the dispute shall be referred
to the Accounting Firm. The Required Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser,
on the other hand, each shall 

 



\- 14 -  submit its determination of the Closing Adjustment Calculation to the
Accounting Firm and all work papers and back-up materials relating thereto
requested by the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall be authorized to
resolve only those items in dispute within the range of the difference between
the Required Sellers determination of the Closing Adjustment Calculation and
Purchasers determination of the Closing Adjustment Calculation. The Parties
shall cause the Accounting Firm to make a determination within 30 days after
submission of the dispute to the Accounting Firm. The determination of the
Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on each Party, including all of
the Sellers. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be split
equally between Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers in accordance with
their Pro Rata Shares, on the other hand. Purchaser and the Sellers agree that
the procedure set forth in this _Section 2.4(b)_ for resolving disputes with
respect to the Closing Adjustment Calculation shall be the sole and exclusive
method for resolving any such disputes; _provided_ , that this provision shall
not prohibit Purchaser or the Sellers from instituting litigation to enforce
the determination of the Accounting Firm.

(c) _Mechanics_. If on the date on which the Closing Adjustment Calculation
is finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)(ii)_ the total adjustment
set forth on such final Closing Adjustment Calculation results in a Purchase
Price greater than the Purchase Price that would have resulted from the
Estimated Adjustment, Purchaser shall, within three Business Days, pay to the
Sellers, by wire transfer or other delivery of immediately available funds to
the bank accounts of the Sellers specified by the Sellers, an amount equal to
each Sellers Pro Rata Share of such difference, and if on the date on which
the Closing Adjustment Calculation is finally determined pursuant to _Section
2.4(b)(ii)_, the total adjustment set forth on such final Closing Adjustment
Calculation results in a Purchase Price less than the Purchase Price that
would have resulted from the Estimated Adjustment, the Escrow Agent shall,
within three Business Days, release such difference to Purchaser from
each Sellers Escrow Account in accordance with each Sellers Pro Rata Share
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, and the Sellers agree to
provide written instructions to the Escrow Agent for the release of such
amount to Purchaser. 

2.5. _Escrow Agreement_. At the Closing, Purchaser, each Seller and Escrow
Agent shall enter into the Escrow Agreement, pursuant to which the Escrow
Amount shall be deposited by Purchaser into separate escrow accounts for each
Seller (the " _Escrow Accounts_ ") in accordance with each Sellers Pro Rata
Share for the purpose of securing Sellers obligations pursuant to _Sections
2.3_ and _2.4_ and _Article IX_, to be released as provided herein and in the
Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Escrowed
Funds remaining in the Escrow Accounts will be released to the Sellers 12
months following the Closing Date; _provided_ , that to the extent any claim
on any Escrowed Funds remains outstanding in accordance with this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement, the amount of such claim will remain in escrow
until such claim is resolved in accordance with _Section 2.3_, _Section 2.4_
or _Section 9.3_, as applicable, and the Escrow Agreement.

 

2.6. _Section 754 Election_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties
agree that the Company shall attach a properly completed election statement
to the Companys Tax Returns for its taxable year that will end on or include
the Closing Date (as applicable)

 



\- 15 -  pursuant to Section 754 of the Code (and any similar provisions of
applicable state, local or foreign Law) effective for the Tax period that
includes the Closing Date. The Party responsible for filing the relevant Tax
Return pursuant to this Agreement shall cause the election to be filed.

(b) Purchaser, Sellers and the Company shall cooperate as provided herein in
determining the allocation of the Purchase Price and other applicable items,
as a result of the Section 754 election made pursuant to _clause (a)_ , among
the Companys assets in accordance with Code Section 755 and for purposes of
(x) Treasury Regulations Section 1.743-1(d)(2) in determining the applicable
adjustment to the U.S. federal Income Tax basis of the Companys assets and
(y) Treasury Regulations Section 1.751-1(a)(2) in determining the character
of each Sellers gain or loss, as the case may be, for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes in respect of the Contemplated Transactions. Purchaser shall
initially determine such allocation and shall notify the Sellers in writing
of the allocation so determined within 60 days after the Closing Date. The
Sellers shall be deemed to have accepted such determination, which shall be
final and binding on all Parties, unless the Required Sellers notify
Purchaser in writing of the Sellers proposed allocation within 30 days after
delivery of Purchasers proposed allocation. If the Required Sellers provide
such notice to Purchaser in such 30-day period, then Purchaser shall
promptly meet with Representatives of such Required Sellers and attempt in
good faith to reach a resolution of such disagreement. If they are unable to
do so within 30 days, the matter shall be referred to the Accounting Firm. The
decision of the Accounting Firm shall be binding on all Parties, including
each Seller. The Accounting Firms fees shall be shared equally by Purchaser,
on one hand, and the Sellers in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, on the
other. Neither Purchaser, the Company nor any Seller shall take any position
for Tax purposes that is inconsistent with the final allocation determined
hereunder unless such position would be consistent with a final agreement with
the IRS or a final determination of a court of competent jurisdiction.

2.7. _Employee Compensatory Arrangements_.

 

(a) Purchaser agrees to continue the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan
without amendment (other than amendment required by Law).

 

(b) With respect to each SARs Participant who provides a written consent on or
before the Effective Time, each outstanding SAR award agreement granted to
such SAR Participant shall be modified to fully vest the award agreement as of
the Effective Time with a fixed payout equal to the amount of his or her
applicable Employee Compensatory Arrangement in accordance with
_Schedule 2.7(b)_. Vested awards shall be paid at the time specified under,
and subject to the terms of, the SAR Plan as modified by the previous
sentence; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, a SAR Participants
award shall be forfeited only in the event that such SAR Participant is
terminated by the Company for Cause (as defined in the SAR Plan). The Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such written consents
from all SAR Participants, in a form reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and
its counsel, promptly following the date of this Agreement, which written
consents and vesting of outstanding awards shall be conditioned upon the
occurrence of the Effective Time. Purchaser shall perform, or cause the
Company to perform, the obligations under this _Section 2.7(b)_.

such determination letter has been revoked and revocation has not been
threatened, and nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to act,
that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification.

years contributed or has been obligated to contribute to an Employee Benefit
Plan subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA, including any
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), and no event
or fact exists which could give rise to any liability of the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate under Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA.

insurance conversion privileges under state Law.

 

(g) None of the Company Plans are the subject of any audit, controversy or
claim initiated by any Governmental Entity. The Company has at all times
complied with the health care continuation requirements of Part 6 of Title I
of ERISA. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
claim in respect of any of the Company Plans other than claims for benefits in
the Ordinary Course of Business.

(h) _Schedule 4.14(h)_ discloses each agreement with any Member, director,
executive officer or other employee of the Company (i) providing any term of
employment or compensation guarantee or (ii) providing severance benefits or
other benefits after the Termination of Employment of such director, executive
officer or employee.

 



\- 27 - (i) The Company has no express or implied commitment (i) to create or incur
liability with respect to or cause to exist any other Employee Benefit Plan,
program or arrangement or (ii) to modify, change or terminate any Company
Plan, other than with respect to a modification or change required by ERISA,
the Code or the terms of any Company Plan.

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions (alone or together with any other event)
will (i) result in any payment (including, severance, unemployment
compensation, retention bonus, "golden parachute" or excess parachute payment
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) to any current or former
employee of the Company that, individually or collectively, could give rise to
the imposition of any excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code or the payment
of any amount that would be non-deductible pursuant to Section 280G of the
Code, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any benefit plan to
any current or former employee of the Company or (iii) except as expressly

payment or vesting of any benefit to any current or former employee of the

(k) Each Employee Benefit Plan subject to Section 409A of the Code has been
maintained and operated in material compliance with Section 409A of the Code
so that no material Taxes under Section 409A of the Code may be imposed on
participants in such plans.

 

4.15. _Labor Matters_. The Company has complied in all material respects with
all Laws which relate to employment, including payment of wages, overtime
compensation, hours of work, discrimination, harassment and retaliation,
leaves of absence, reasonable accommodation, workplace safety and collective
bargaining. The Company is not a party to any collective
bargaining agreement, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, its employees are
not represented by any labor organization with respect to their employment for
the Company. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened organized strikes, lockouts, work stoppages or slowdowns involving
employees of the Company.

4.16. _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) All material Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of the
Company have been timely filed and such Tax Returns as so filed are complete
and accurate in all material respects and disclose all material Taxes required
to be paid for the periods covered thereby and all Taxes (if any) shown to be
due on such Tax Returns have been timely paid. No extension of time in which
to file any such Tax Return is in effect or has been requested. All material
Taxes for which the Company is liable relating to any period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date (or the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date, as determined in accordance with _Section 4.16(b)_) shall have
been paid or, if not yet due and payable, properly accrued in accordance with
GAAP for by the Company as of the Closing Date. All material Taxes which the
Company is required by Law to withhold or to collect for payment have been
duly withheld and collected, and have been paid to the proper Taxing
authority. There are no

 



\- 28 -  Tax liens on any property of the Company other than Permitted Encumbrances.
No audit or examination of any kind is currently pending or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, threatened with respect to any Tax Return of the Company by
any Taxing authority. All deficiencies which have been asserted as a result of
any prior audit or examination have been fully paid or finally settled. There
are no outstanding agreements or waivers extending the statutes of
limitations with respect to the assessment of any Tax and no such agreements
or waivers have been requested. The accruals for Taxes reflected on the
Balance Sheet are adequate to cover any Tax liability of the Company as of the
Balance Sheet Date. Since the Balance Sheet Date, the Company has not taken
any action not in accordance with past practice that would have the effect of
deferring any Tax liability of the Company from any Taxable period ending on
or before the Closing Date to any Taxable period ending after the Closing
Date. No claim has ever been made by, and no written notice has been received
from, a Taxing authority in a foreign, federal, state, or local jurisdiction
where the Company has not paid Taxes or filed Tax Returns asserting that the
Company is or may be subject to Taxes assessed by such jurisdiction.

(b) For purposes of  _Section 4.16(a)_, (i) any period beginning before and
ending after the Effective Time (a " _Straddle Period_ ") shall, in the case
of income, receipts, remuneration, sales, proceeds, profits or similar items
and other Taxes that are readily apportionable based on an actual or deemed
closing of the books of the Company, be treated as two partial periods based
on such a closing of the books, one ending on the Effective Time and the other
beginning after the Effective Time, and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes
with respect to a Straddle Period, such Taxes shall be allocated pro rata on a
daily basis.

 

4.17. _Insurance_. _Schedule 4.17_ hereto sets forth a list of all material
insurance policies maintained by or on behalf of the Company on the date of
this Agreement (the " _Company Policies_ "). With respect to the Company
Policies: (a) all are in full force and effect and no notice of cancellation
or termination has been received with respect to any such policy or binder;
(b) to the Knowledge of the Company, all have been complied with in all
material respects by the policyholder; (c) all premiums due and payable under
all such policies have been paid; and (d) to the Knowledge of the Company,
there is no pending claim under any such policy as to which coverage has been
denied or disputed by the underwriters or issuers thereof, except, in the
cases of _clauses (a)_ through _(d)_ , as would not have a Material Adverse
Effect.

4.18. _Affiliate Transactions_.

 

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company (i) does not have
outstanding (A) notes receivable from the Sellers or any of their Affiliates,
(B) accounts payable to the Sellers or any of the Affiliates or (C) advances
by the Company to the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, except in all cases
for any such matters or amounts created in the Ordinary Course of Business.

Affiliates other than the LLC Agreement, the applicable Legacy Affiliate

Company in accordance with GAAP (except to the extent that such assets have
been disposed of after the Balance Sheet Date in the Ordinary Course of
Business), free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than Permitted
Encumbrances.

4.20. _No Brokers_. The Company is not obligated under any contract or
agreement which would result in the obligation of the Company to pay any
finders fee, brokerage or agents commissions in connection with the
negotiations leading to this Agreement or the consummation of the Contemplated

including joint defense agreements) or (B) contravene any applicable Laws,

documents in Legal Proceedings, pursuant to subpoena, civil investigative
demand or other similar demand of any Governmental Entity) to disclose all or
any part of such Confidential Information; (B) to the extent not inconsistent

reasonably requested by Purchaser (at Purchasers sole expense) to seek to
obtain an order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will

rights hereunder or (3) as such Party reasonably determines it is
legally obligated to disclose by applicable securities Laws or by the rules
of a stock exchange. Each Seller will direct its Representatives to observe
the terms of this _Section 6.4(b)_, and each Seller will be responsible for

option or other legally binding arrangement for the Transfer of, or consent
to any Transfer of, any or all of such Seller Subsidiarys Units, or any
right, title or interest therein, or seek to do any of the foregoing. No

recorded on the books of the Company and any such attempted Transfer shall be
void and of no effect.

_Section 6.5_, Tribune Publishing Company) shall issue any press release or
public announcement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement without,
in the case of any Seller, the prior written consent of Purchaser (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), or in the
case of Purchaser, the prior written consent of the Sellers (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any Party may make any public disclosure that is, in the
opinion of the disclosing Partys counsel, required by applicable Law or the
rules of a stock exchange. In the event a Party is, in the opinion of its
counsel, required to make a public disclosure relating to the subject matter
of this Agreement by applicable Law or the rules of a stock exchange, such
Party shall, to the extent practicable, submit the proposed disclosure in
writing to the other Parties prior to the date of disclosure and provide the
other Parties a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon; _provided_ , that
such Party shall not be required to submit to the other Parties subsequent
required disclosures to the extent consistent with such initial required

commercially reasonable efforts to ensure satisfaction of the conditions
precedent to each Partys obligations hereunder and under the Ancillary
Agreements and to obtain, to the extent practicable, any consents of any third
party necessary in connection with the consummation of the Contemplated

ARTICLE IX.

 

INDEMNIFICATION

9.1.  _Indemnification of Purchaser Group Members and the Company_.

(a) After the Closing, each Seller agrees to indemnify, reimburse and hold
harmless each Purchaser Group Member from and against any and all Losses
incurred by any such Purchaser Group Member, directly or indirectly, in
connection with or arising from:

 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of such Seller contained in
_Article V_ (disregarding any materiality, "Seller Material Adverse Effect"
or similar qualifications contained in such representations and warranties
other than with respect to the representations and warranties of such Seller
set forth in _Section 5.6_); or

 

(ii) any breach by such Seller of any covenant to be performed by such Seller
hereunder.

 

(b) After the Closing, Sellers, severally but not jointly, in accordance with
their respective Pro Rata Shares, agree to indemnify, reimburse and hold
harmless each Purchaser Group Member from and against 73.1% of any and all
Losses incurred by any such Purchaser Group Member, directly or indirectly, in
connection with or arising from any breach of any representation or warranty
of the Company in _Article IV_ (disregarding any materiality, "Material
Adverse Effect" or similar qualifications contained in such representations
and warranties other than with respect to the representations and warranties
of the Company set forth in _Sections 4.8_, _4.9_ , _4.10_ , _4.11(a)_ ,
_4.13(e)_ , _4.14(a)_ and the first sentence of _4.17_ ).

 

9.2. _Indemnification of the Sellers_. After the Closing, Purchaser agrees to
indemnify, reimburse and hold harmless each Seller Group Member from and
against any and all Losses incurred by any such Seller Group Member, directly
or indirectly, in connection with or arising from:

 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser in _Article
III_ (disregarding any materiality, "Purchaser Material Adverse Effect" or
similar qualifications contained in such representations and warranties);

 



\- 48 - (b) any breach by Purchaser of any covenant to be performed by Purchaser
hereunder; or

 

(c) any breach by the Company of any covenant to be performed by the Company
hereunder following the Closing.

 

9.3. _Notice and Determination of Claims_.

 

(a) If a Purchaser Group Member or Seller Group Member (the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") has a claim for indemnification under this  _Article IX_, such
Indemnified Party shall give to the Party obligated to provide indemnification
to such Indemnified Party (the " _Indemnitor_ ") a notice in writing (a "
_Claim Notice_ ") as soon as practical describing in reasonable detail the
facts giving rise to any claim for indemnification hereunder and shall include
in such Claim Notice (to the extent then known or ascertainable) the amount or
the method of computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to the
provision of this Agreement upon which such claim is based; _provided_ , that
a Claim Notice in respect of any pending or threatened Legal Proceeding by or
against a third Person as to which indemnification will be sought (each such
Legal Proceeding being a " _Third Person Claim_ ") shall be given promptly
after the Legal Proceeding is commenced; _provided_ _further_ that failure to
give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations
hereunder except to the extent it shall have been materially prejudiced by
such failure. To the extent that Losses are not capable of being calculated at
the time of any Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party shall include in such
Claim Notice its reasonable estimate of the maximum Losses that may result
from such claim for indemnification under this _Article IX_. For the
avoidance of doubt, if the Sellers collectively are the Indemnitor with
respect to any indemnification claim, all references in this _Article IX_ to
any agreement, acknowledgment, election, decision, consent, conduct, control
or other act or omission of such Indemnitor means the agreement,
acknowledgment, election, decision, consent, conduct, control or other act or
omission of the Required Sellers, which shall be binding upon each of the
Sellers.

(b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of
indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this
_Article IX_ shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor or (ii) by a final judgment or decree in
accordance with _Sections 11.12_ and _11.13_. The judgment or decree of a
court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have
expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall
have been finally determined.

(c) When any determination of payment from the Escrowed Funds becomes final
and binding hereunder (including under _Section 2.3_, _Section 2.4_ and this
_Article IX_), Purchaser and each Seller agrees to promptly sign and deliver
to the Escrow Agent a written instruction to release any portion of the
Escrowed Funds as to which such determination has become final and binding to
the Party entitled to such portion of the Escrowed Funds.

 

9.4. _Third Person Claims_. If a Third Person Claim is made against an
Indemnified Party, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate therein
and, to the extent that the Indemnitor shall wish, to assume the defense
thereof in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and, after notice from
the Indemnitor to the Indemnified Party of such election to so assume the
defense thereof, the

 



\- 49 -  Indemnitor shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other Losses in each case subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof;
_provided_ , that the Indemnitor will pay the legal expenses of the
Indemnified Partys separate counsel if, in the Indemnified Partys good faith
judgment, it is advisable, based on advice of counsel, for the Indemnified
Party to be represented by such separate counsel because a conflict exists
between the Indemnitor and the Indemnified Party or because there is a
reasonable probability that the Third Person Claim may materially and
adversely affect the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates other than as a
result of monetary damages. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully with
the Indemnitor and its counsel in the defense against any such Third Person
Claim. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate at its own
expense in the defense of any Third Person Claim. Neither the Indemnitor, on
the one hand, nor the Indemnified Party, on the other hand, shall admit
liability to, or settle, compromise or discharge any Third Person Claim
without the prior consent of the other (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Indemnitor may settle, compromise or discharge any Third Person Claim, the
defense of which was assumed by the Indemnitor, if such Third Person Claim
does not impose equitable remedies or any obligation on the Indemnified Party
and provides only for the payment of monetary damages that are completely
indemnified by the Indemnitor hereunder, includes an unconditional written
release by the claimant or plaintiff of the Indemnified Party from all
liability in respect of such Third Person Claim, and the Indemnified Party
would not have any further liability thereunder. In the event the Indemnitor
elects not to defend any Third Person Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
defend against such Third Person Claim in good faith and in a commercially
reasonable manner at the cost and expense of the Indemnitor, and the
Indemnitor shall have the right to participate in such defense at its own
expense.

9.5. _Limitations_. Liability for claims pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall
be subject to the following limitations:

(a) The representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of 12 months from the Closing
Date and shall expire thereafter; _provided_ , that such representations and
warranties shall survive beyond such period with respect to (but only with
respect to) any breach thereof for which a Claim Notice shall have been duly
given in accordance with _Section 9.3(a)_ until such claim shall have been
finally resolved. The covenants and agreements of the Parties contained
in this Agreement shall survive indefinitely unless the covenant or agreement
specifies a term, in which case such covenant or agreement shall survive for
such specified term.

 

(b) No Purchaser Group Member shall be entitled to indemnification under
Section 9.1(a)(i) and Section 9.1(b) with respect to any Losses for an
individual claim or aggregated claims arising out of the same facts, events or
circumstances, that do not exceed $50,000 (the "Per Claim Threshold");
provided, that the Per Claim Threshold shall not apply to breaches of
any Fundamental Representations.

(c) No Purchaser Group Member shall be entitled to indemnification under
_Section 9.1(a)(i)_ and  _Section 9.1(b)_ with respect to any Losses that
are in excess of the Per Claim Threshold until the aggregate amount of such
Losses that are in excess of the Per Claim Threshold exceeds $9,000,000 (the "
_Deductible_ ") and then only for such Losses that are in excess of the Per
Claim Threshold in excess of the Deductible; _provided_ , that the Deductible
shall not apply to breaches of any Fundamental Representations.

 



\- 50 - (d) No amounts shall be payable for Losses in connection with any claim for
indemnification under this _Article IX_:

(i) unless the Indemnified Party has given the Indemnitor a Claim Notice with
respect to such claim as soon as practical following the time at which the
Indemnified Party discovered, or reasonably should have discovered, such claim
(except to the extent the Indemnitor is not materially prejudiced by such
failure) and, in any event, prior to the date on which the applicable
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement ceases to survive pursuant to
_Section 9.5(a)_;

(ii) to the extent any matter forming the basis for such Loss was (A)
reserved for on the Balance Sheet or (B) taken into account in calculating the
Estimated Net Working Capital or Closing Date Net Working Capital, and no
Losses related thereto shall be aggregated for purposes of _Sections 9.5(b)_
or _9.5(c)_ ; or

(iii) to the extent it asserts a claim for consequential, incidental,
indirect, special or punitive damages ((x) other than for reasonably
foreseeable consequential damages and any consequential damages payable to a
third party in respect of any Third Person Claim and (y) in the case
of punitive damages, other than for amounts payable to third parties in
respect of any Third Person Claim pursuant to a Law).

(e) The maximum aggregate liability of each Seller to the Purchaser Group
Members under this Agreement for all indemnification claims under this
_Article IX_ shall be the amount remaining in such Sellers Escrow Account
and (ii) the sole recourse of the Purchaser Group Members with respect to any
indemnification claims under this _Article IX_ shall be to the Escrowed
Amounts.

 

(f) From and after the Closing, the indemnities set forth in this _Article
IX_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parties, their successors
and assigns, and their Representatives with respect to this Agreement, the
events giving rise to this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, except
(a) for claims grounded in fraud, (b) as provided in  _Sections 6.12_ and
_11.10_ , (c) remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of Law, and (d) as
provided in the New Affiliation Agreements. The indemnities set forth in this
_Article IX_ apply only to matters arising out of this Agreement. Any Loss
arising under or pursuant to an Ancillary Agreement (including the New
Affiliation Agreements) shall be governed by the indemnification obligations,
if any, contained in such Ancillary Agreement (including New Affiliation
Agreement). The Parties shall not be entitled to a rescission of this
Agreement or to any further indemnification rights or claims of any nature
whatsoever in respect hereof (whether by Contract, Law or otherwise, all of
which the Parties hereby waive).

(g) In no event will any Purchaser Group Member be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9.1(b) _for any Losses to the extent such Losses relate
to any action or inaction by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (provided
that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Parties understand and agree that this
_Section 9.5(g)_ shall not apply to any action or inaction of the Board of
Directors, or any voting action of the Members, in each case, in his, her or
its capacity as such).

 



\- 51 - 9.6. _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Parties hereto and each
Indemnified Party and Indemnitor agree to treat any indemnity payment made
pursuant to this _Article IX_ as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for
federal, state, local and foreign income Tax purposes unless a contrary
treatment is required under applicable Law.

9.7. _Tax Benefits_. Any indemnification obligation under this _Article IX_
shall be adjusted so as to give effect to any actual reduction in federal,
state, local or foreign income or franchise Tax liability (either by decrease
in Taxes paid or increase in a refund due) in the year of a payment with
respect to such indemnification obligation or any earlier period; _provided_
, _however_ , that any such reduction shall not exceed the difference between
the aggregate amount of any expected actual reduction of such Taxes (assuming
no Tax limitation applied on their use) less the aggregate amount of Tax
detriment from the receipt of the indemnification payment paid to the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or loss of Tax benefits suffered by
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates on account the
applicable Loss.

9.8. _Insurance Offset_. If any Losses sustained by an Indemnified Party are
covered by an insurance policy or an indemnification or contribution
obligation of another Person (other than an Affiliate of such Indemnified
Party), the Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
collect such insurance proceeds or indemnification or contribution payment.
If the Indemnified Party receives such insurance proceeds or indemnity or
contribution payments prior to being indemnified under this _Article IX_, the
payment by an Indemnitor under this _Article IX_ with respect to such Losses
shall be reduced by the net amount of such insurance proceeds or indemnity or
contribution payments paid to the Indemnified Party to the extent related to
such Losses, less reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses incurred
in connection with such recovery. If the Indemnified Party receives such
insurance proceeds or indemnity or contribution payments within 12 months
after being indemnified by an Indemnitor with respect to such Losses, the
Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnitor the net amount of such
insurance proceeds or indemnity or contribution payments to the extent related
to such Losses, less reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses incurred in
connection with such recovery.

 

ARTICLE X.

appealable; 

(e) Purchaser, the Company or the Sellers may terminate this Agreement if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or before 5:00 p.m., local Chicago time,

Agreement, the " _End Date_ ") for any reason or no reason; _provided_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement set forth in this _Section 10.1(e)_
shall not be available to a Party whose breach of this Agreement materially

may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(e)_ during the

this Agreement, (b) that nothing herein shall relieve any Party from liability
for fraud or intentional breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such
termination, and (c) that nothing herein shall relieve Purchaser from any
liability for Purchasers failure to pay the Purchase Price on the Closing
Date if all of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 7.2_ are
satisfied or to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waived (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing),
_provided_ , that in the case of this  _clause (c)_ , the aggregate amount of
Losses, if any, payable by Purchaser for such breach shall not exceed the

Any Party may change the address to which notices, requests, demands, claims
and other communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other
Parties notice in the manner herein set forth.

11.2. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and assigns; _provided_
, _however_ , that no assignment shall be made by either Party without the
prior written consent of the other Parties. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (a) any Party may assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement without such consent to an Affiliate or in connection with a sale,
merger or other transaction involving a transfer of substantially all of its
assets; _provided_  that such assigning Party shall remain primarily liable
for its obligations hereunder. Any attempted assignment in violation of this
_Section 11.2_ shall be void.

 

11.3. _Interpretation_. The Schedules and Exhibits referred to herein shall be
construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent
as if they were set forth verbatim herein. Titles to Articles and headings of
Sections are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not be
deemed a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements shall be construed
without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or
interpretation against the Party drafting an instrument or causing any
instrument to be drafted.

 

11.4. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (delivery of which may be by facsimile or .pdf), each of which
shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument.

 



\- 56 - 11.5. _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented
except by a writing signed by the Company, Purchaser and the Sellers.

11.6. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and
Exhibits attached hereto), together with the Ancillary Agreements, constitutes
the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties hereto with regard to
the subject matter contained herein or therein, and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof.

11.7.  _Consultation with Counsel_. Each Seller hereby acknowledges that it
has had the opportunity to consult with its own counsel with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement, and has read and understands all of the
provisions of this Agreement. Each Seller hereby further acknowledges that it
has had the opportunity to ask questions of, and to seek additional
information from, the Company with respect to each of the matters set forth
herein.

 

11.8. _Severability_. Wherever possible, each provision hereof shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law,
but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any
reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
provision shall be ineffective in the jurisdiction involved to the extent,
but only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
without invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a
construction would be unreasonable.

11.9. _Third Parties_. Except as otherwise set forth in _Article IX_, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall create any rights in, or be deemed to have
been executed for the benefit of, any Person or entity that is not a Party
hereto or a successor or permitted assign of such a Party.

 

11.10. _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, in
view of the uniqueness of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the other Parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement (including the obligations in _Article VI_) are
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise
are breached. Accordingly, each Party agrees that the other Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and
the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court of the
United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the Parties and
the matter, without the necessity of proving damages, posting any bond or
other undertaking, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be
entitled, at Law or in equity.

11.11. _Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived, or
the time for its performance may be extended, by Purchaser for the benefit of
Purchaser and by the Sellers for the benefit of the Sellers. Any such waiver
shall be validly and sufficiently authorized for the purposes of
this Agreement if, as to any Party, it is authorized in writing by an
authorized Representative of such Party. In addition to the first sentence of
this _Section 11.11_ and notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, if as of the End Date all conditions to this Agreement have
been satisfied or waived (other than those that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing) other than one or more of the conditions set forth
in _Sections 7.1(c)_,  _7.1(d)_ , _7.2(c)_ and _7.2(d)_ , either Purchaser
or the Sellers (so long as the failure of

 



\- 57 -  the condition to be satisfied or waived by such date has not in material
part resulted from a breach of this Agreement by such Party) may unilaterally
extend, by written notice to the other Parties, the End Date to 5:00 p.m.,
local Chicago time, on May 18, 2015. The failure of any Party hereto to
enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to
be a waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this
Agreement or any part hereof or the right of any Party thereafter to enforce
each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall
be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

 

11.12. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware, without reference
to provisions of conflicts of Laws that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

11.13. _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party (a)
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting
in the State of Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (c)
waives any claim of inconvenient forum or other challenge to venue in such
court, (d) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement in any other court and (e) waives any right it
may have to a trial by jury with respect to any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement. Each Party agrees to accept service of
any summons, complaint or other initial pleading made in the manner provided
for the giving of notices in _Section 11.1_, _provided_ , that nothing in
this _Section 11.13_ shall affect the right of any Party to serve such
summons, complaint or other initial pleading in any other manner permitted by
applicable Law.
