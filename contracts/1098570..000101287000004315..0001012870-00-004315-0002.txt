Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and, with respect to Articles VII and IX
hereof only, J. Markham Green as the Securityholder Agent and U.S. Bank Trust,
National Association as Escrow Agent.

                                   RECITALS

     A.   The Boards of Directors of each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub

stockholders that Parent acquire the Company through the statutory merger of

have approved the Merger.

and conditions of this Agreement, all of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company ("Company Capital Stock") shall be converted into
shares of voting Common Stock of Parent ("Parent Common Stock").

Parent in connection with the Merger shall be placed in escrow by Parent, the
release of which amount shall be contingent upon certain events and conditions,
all as set forth in Article VII hereof.

     D.   It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall constitute
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and that the Merger shall be accounted for as
a purchase.

     E.   As a material inducement for Parent to consummate the Merger, certain
employee/stockholders of the Company will enter into non-competition agreements
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Non-Competition
                                             ---------
Agreements") with Parent, each of which shall become effective as of the
Effective Time (as defined herein).

     F.   Concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
material inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain affiliate
stockholders of the Company are executing and delivering stockholder support
agreements (the "Support Agreements"), substantially in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit B, to Parent.

representations and warranties and other agreements in connection with the

Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with the Delaware Law and as provided in such Certificate of
Incorporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time, Article I of the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and
restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is

     1.5  Directors and Officers. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior
          ----------------------
to the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the

          --------------------------------------------

provided in the respective option agreements immediately prior to the Effective
Time (including, without limitation, any vesting schedule or repurchase rights),

shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and
(ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of such assumed Company Option will be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Capital Stock at
which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

          (iii) Assumption of Warrants. At the Effective Time, the Warrants
                ----------------------
will be assumed by Parent. Each Warrant so assumed by Parent under this
Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions set forth in the applicable warrant agreement immediately prior to
the Effective Time (including, without limitation, any repurchase rights or

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

vesting provisions), except that (i) each Warrant will be exercisable (or will
become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Warrant immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise
price for the share of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
assumed Warrant will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Warrant was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded to the nearest whole cent.

          (iv)  Withholding Taxes. Any number of shares of Parent Common Stock
                -----------------
issuable pursuant to Section 1.6(b)(i) shall be subject to, and reduced by, the
amount of any state, federal and foreign taxes required by law to be withheld
and paid to government entities (and not previously paid by or on behalf of the
Company) in connection with the acquisition of capital stock upon the exercise
of Company Options, the acceleration of vesting of any Company Common Stock or
Company Options, or the payment of a bonus, if any. For purposes of any such
reduction, a share of Parent Common Stock shall be valued at the 10-Day Average
Price.

          (v)   Fractional Shares. No fractional share of Parent Common Stock
                -----------------
shall be issued in the Merger. In lieu thereof, each holder of shares of Company
Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall, upon surrender of such
holder's Certificate(s) (as defined below) receive from Parent an amount of cash
(rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of
(i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the 10-Day Average Price.

          (vi)  Cancellation of Parent-Owned and Company-Owned Stock. At the
                ----------------------------------------------------
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any of the parties hereto, each share of Company Capital Stock owned by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
thereof immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof.

          (vii) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, by
                ---------------------------
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any of the parties
hereto, each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged
for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing
ownership of any such shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares
of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

     1.7  Shares Subject to Vesting. If any shares of Company Common Stock
          -------------------------
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or
are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under
any applicable stock restriction agreement or other agreement with the Company,
then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

shares of Company Common Stock shall also be unvested and subject to the same
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition (including any
requirement that any unvested shares be held in escrow), and the certificate
representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with
appropriate legends in the discretion of Parent.

     1.8  Dissenting Shares for Holders of Company Capital Stock.
          ------------------------------------------------------

          (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
any shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder who has demanded and
perfected appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with Delaware Law
and/or who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such
appraisal rights ("Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent
a right to receive Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6, but the holder
thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted by Delaware Law.

          (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), if any holder of
shares of Company Capital Stock who demands appraisal of such shares under
Delaware Law shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or
otherwise) the right to appraisal, then, as of the later of the Effective Time
and the occurrence of such event, such holder's shares shall automatically be
converted into and represent only the right to receive Parent Common Stock as
provided in Section 1.6 (and subject to the provisions of Section 7.2 hereof),
without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate representing such
shares.

          (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Capital Stock, withdrawals of
such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and
received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Delaware Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal
of capital stock of the Company or offer to settle or settle any such demands.
To the extent that Parent or the Company makes any payment or payments in
respect of any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall be entitled to recover under the
terms of Article VII hereof the aggregate amount by which such payment or
payments exceed the aggregate consideration that otherwise would have been
payable in respect of such shares.

     1.9  Surrender of Certificates.
          -------------------------

          (a) Exchange Agent. The transfer agent of Parent (or another entity
              --------------
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) shall serve as exchange agent
(the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger.

          (b) Parent to Provide Parent Common Stock. Prior to the Closing,
              -------------------------------------
Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance
with this Article I the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to Company
Stockholders pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for outstanding shares of
Company Capital Stock, less the Escrow Amount which Parent shall deposit into
the Escrow Fund (as defined in Section 7.2(a) hereof) on behalf of the Company
Stockholders.

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

The portion of the Escrow Amount contributed on behalf of each Company
Stockholder shall be in proportion to the aggregate number of shares of Parent
Common Stock which each such Company Stockholder would otherwise be entitled to
receive in the Merger as compared to the total number of shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued to holders of outstanding Company Capital Stock pursuant to
Section 1.6(b)(i) above (excluding any shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of any assumed Company Options and Warrants) by virtue of
ownership of outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

          (c) Exchange Procedures. Promptly following the Closing, Parent shall
              -------------------
cause to be mailed to each Company Stockholder (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall be in such form and contain such provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represent outstanding shares of Company Capital
Stock whose shares are converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.6, shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent), (ii) a stockholder lock-up letter in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit C (a "Stockholder Lock-Up Letter"), and (iii)
                   ---------
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for certificates representing Merger Consideration.  Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal
and Stockholder Lock-Up Letter, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the Company Stockholder shall be
entitled to receive, and the Exchange Agent shall promptly deliver in exchange
therefor, a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock (less the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be deposited in the
Escrow Fund on such holder's behalf pursuant to Section 1.9(b) and Article VII
hereof), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
Promptly after the Effective Time, and subject to and in accordance with the
provisions of Article VII hereof, Parent shall cause to be distributed to the
Escrow Agent (as defined in Article VII) a certificate or certificates
representing that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Escrow
Amount which shall be registered in the name of the Escrow Agent.  Such shares
shall be available to compensate Parent as provided in Article VII.  Until so
surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time,
represented shares of Company Capital Stock will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, other than the payment of dividends,
to evidence the ownership of the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock
into which such shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been so converted.

          (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or
              ------------------------------------------------
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate in respect of the shares of Parent
Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate
shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender
of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, plus the amount of dividends or other

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

distributions (without interest) with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

          (e) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for shares of Parent
              ----------------------
Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of
Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered.

          (f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
              --------------------------------------
Certificates evidencing shares of Company Common Stock shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent Common Stock as may be required
pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof; provided, however, that Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
Company Stockholder who is the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may reasonably direct
against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

          (g) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
              ------------
Section 1.9, neither Parent nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of
shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Capital Stock for any amount properly
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar law.

          (h) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. The shares
              ----------------------------------------------------
of Parent Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to shares of Company
Capital Stock outstanding prior to the Effective Time, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of Parent of shares of Company
Capital Stock that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Parent for any reason, they shall
be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

          (i) Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after
              ------------------------------------------
the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of Company, Parent and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of
Company, Parent and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the name of their
respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and
necessary action.

          ---------------------------
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware. The Company has the corporate power to own its properties and to carry
on its business as now being conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction
in which the failure to be so qualified would be material. The Company has made
available to Parent a true and correct copy of its Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws, each as amended to date. Company Schedule 2.1 lists the directors
                                     --------------------

Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or any agreement to which

applicable federal and state securities laws. The designations, powers,
preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions in respect of
the Company Preferred Stock are as set forth in the Company's Certificate of

               Registered Intellectual Property owned by, or filed in the name
               of, the Parent.

person (including rights to privacy or publicity), or constitute unfair
competition or trade practices in violation of the applicable laws of any
jurisdiction, and Parent has received no notice from any person claiming that
such operation or any act, product, technology or service (including products,

          --------------------------------------

               (a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of
this Agreement, but in no event later than August 14, 2000, Parent and Company

(a "California Permit") from the Commissioner of Corporations of the State of
California (after a hearing before such Commissioner) pursuant to Section 25121
of the California Corporate Securities Law of 1968, so that the issuance of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger shall be exempt from registration under
Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act; provided, however, that Parent shall not
be responsible for any delay resultant from a failure of the Company to provide
information reasonably required in connection with the California Permit
application process. Company and Parent will respond to any comments from the
California Department of Corporations and use their commercially reasonable
efforts to have the California Permit granted as soon as practicable after such
filing. As promptly as practical after the date of this Agreement, Parent and
Company shall prepare and make such filings as are required under applicable
Blue Sky laws relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company shall use reasonable and good faith efforts to assist Parent as may be
necessary to cause the Permit Application and any solicitation material sent to
stockholders of the Company to comply with the securities and blue sky laws.

               (b) In the event 90 days shall have elapsed since the filing of
the application for the California Permit and Parent shall have not received the
California Permit, as promptly as practicable thereafter, Parent shall prepare
and file, with the full cooperation of the Company, with the SEC a Registration
Statement on Form S-4 (the "S-4"), which will contain a proxy statement to be
                            ---

                                              ---------------
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger.  The Company
shall provide to Parent and its counsel for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, in
form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and its counsel, such information
concerning the Company that Parent or its counsel may reasonably request for
purposes of preparing the S-4.  Each of the Company and Parent will respond to
any comments of the SEC and will use its respective commercially reasonable
efforts to have the S-4 declared effective by the SEC under the Securities Act
as promptly as practicable after such filing and the Company will cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company Stockholders at the earliest
practicable time after the S-4 is declared effective by the SEC.  Each party
will notify the other parties hereto promptly of the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or its staff for amendments or

                                     -40-
<PAGE>

supplements to the S-4 and will supply the other parties with copies of all
correspondence between such party or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the S-4 or
the Proxy Statement. Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to the S-4 and/or the Proxy Statement, Parent or
the Company, as the case may be, will promptly inform the other of such
occurrence and cooperate in filing such amendment or supplement with the SEC.

          (c) As promptly as practicable after the receipt of a California
Permit or the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as the case may be,
the Company shall submit this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
to its stockholders for approval and adoption as provided by Delaware Law and
its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. Such submission shall also include
a solicitation of approval of (i) the escrow obligations of the Company
Stockholders set forth in Article VII hereof and the deposit of Parent Common
Stock equal to the Escrow Amount into the Escrow Fund and (ii) in favor of the
appointment of J. Markham Green as Securityholder Agent, under and as defined in
the Agreement. The Company shall use its best efforts to solicit and obtain the
consent of its stockholders sufficient to approve the Merger and this Agreement
and to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and in any event
no later than 30 days following the receipt of the California Permit or
effectiveness of the S-4 as the case may be. The materials submitted to the

  7.1  Survival of Representations and Warranties.  The representations and
       ------------------------------------------
warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate or
other instrument delivered pursuant to

                                     -51-
<PAGE>

this Agreement, shall terminate on the first anniversary of the Closing Date
(the "Expiration Date"). The representations and warranties of Parent and Merger
Sub contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate or other instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, shall terminate at the Closing.

     7.2  Escrow Arrangements.
          -------------------

            (a) Escrow Fund.  At the Effective Time, the Company Stockholders
                -----------
will be deemed to have received and deposited with the Escrow Agent (as defined
below) the Escrow Amount (plus any additional shares as may be issued upon any
stock split, stock dividend or recapitalization effected by Parent after the
Effective Time) without any act of any Company Stockholder. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, the Escrow Amount, without any act of any
Company Stockholder, will be deposited with U.S. Bank Trust, National
Association (or other institution acceptable to Parent and the Securityholder
Agent (as defined in Section 7.2(g) below)), as Escrow Agent (the "Escrow
Agent"), such deposit to constitute an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") to be
governed by the terms set forth herein and at Parent's cost and expense. The
Escrow Fund shall be available to compensate Parent and its affiliates for any
claims, losses, liabilities, damages, deficiencies, costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, and expenses of investigation
and defense (hereinafter individually a "Loss" and collectively "Losses")
incurred, sustained or paid by Parent, its officers, directors, or affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation) directly or indirectly as a result of (i)
any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty of the Company (as
modified by the Company Schedules) contained in this Agreement or any
certificate, instrument or other document delivered pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, or any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any
covenant contained herein, (ii) the payment by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation of any amount on the account of Dissenting Shares which such payment
or payments exceed the aggregate consideration that otherwise would have been
payable in respect of such shares, (iii) the amount of any Third Party
Obligations that the Company fails to satisfy pursuant to Section 5.6 above
prior to the Effective Time and/or the amount of any cash in excess of the
amounts set forth in Section 5.6 expended for such purpose, (iv) the payment of
any Legal Expenses, or (v) the amount that the Final Cash Balance (as defined in
Section 7.3 below) is less than the lesser of (A) the applicable Minimum Cash
Balance required in Section 5.27 and (B) the Cash Amount reflected on the
Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet. Nothing herein shall limit the liability
of the Company for any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant if the
Merger does not close. Parent may not receive any shares from the Escrow Fund
unless and until Officer's Certificates (as defined in paragraph (d) below)
identifying Losses in the aggregate amount in excess of $2,000,000 (the
"Threshold Amount") have been delivered to the Securityholder Agent (as defined
in paragraph (g) below), in which event Parent shall be entitled to recover only
amounts in excess of the Threshold Amount; provided that notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall be entitled to indemnification on a first dollar basis,
without regard to whether the Threshold Amount has been exceeded, with respect
to (i) the payment by Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any amount on
account of Dissenting Shares, (ii) the amount of any Third Party Obligations
that the Company fails to satisfy pursuant to Section 5.6 above and/or the
amount of any cash in excess of the amounts set forth in Section 5.6 expended
for such purpose, (iii) the payment of any Legal Expenses, and (iv) the amount
that the Final Cash Balance (as defined in Section 7.3 below) is less

                                     -52-
<PAGE>

than the lesser of (A) the applicable Minimum Cash Balance required in Section
5.27 and (B) the Cash Amount reflected on the Estimated Closing Date Balance
Sheet. The Company Stockholders shall not have any right of contribution from
the Company or Parent with respect to any Loss pursuant to this Article VII. For
purposes of this Article VII, references to the terms "material," "materially,"
"in all material respects" and "Material Adverse Effect" shall be disregarded
for purposes of determining whether there was a breach or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty of the Company in Article II, as modified by the
Company Schedules attached hereto, or any certificate, instrument or other
document delivered pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

     (b) Escrow Period; Distribution upon Termination of Escrow Periods.
         --------------------------------------------------------------
Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in existence
immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at 5:00 p.m.,
California time, on the Expiration Date (the "Escrow Period"); provided that
neither the Escrow Period nor the Escrow Fund shall terminate with respect to
such amount (or some portion thereof), that together with the aggregate amount
remaining in the Escrow Fund is necessary in the reasonable judgment of Parent,
subject to the objection of the Securityholder Agent and the subsequent
arbitration of the matter in the manner provided in Section 7.2(f) hereof, to
satisfy any unsatisfied claims concerning facts and circumstances existing prior
to the termination of such Escrow Period specified in any Officer's Certificate
delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to termination of such Escrow Period.  As
soon as all such claims have been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to
the Company Stockholders the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund not required
to satisfy such claims.  Deliveries of Escrow Amounts to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to this Section 7.2(b) shall be made in proportion to
their respective original contributions to the Escrow Fund as determined
pursuant to Section 1.9(b).

     (c) Protection of Escrow Fund.
         -------------------------

           (i)  The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund during
the Escrow Period, shall treat such fund as a trust fund in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and not as the property of Parent and shall hold and
dispose of the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the terms hereof.

          (ii)  Any shares of Parent Common Stock or other equity securities
issued or distributed by Parent (including shares issued upon a stock split)
("New Shares") in respect of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund which have
not been released from the Escrow Fund shall be added to the Escrow Fund and
become a part thereof.  New Shares issued in respect of shares of Parent Common
Stock which have been released from the Escrow Fund shall not be added to the
Escrow Fund but shall be distributed to the recordholders thereof.  Cash
dividends on Parent Common Stock shall not be added to the Escrow Fund but shall
be distributed to the recordholders thereof.

          (iii) Each Company Stockholder shall have voting rights with respect
to the shares of Parent Common Stock contributed to the Escrow Fund by such
Company Stockholder (and on any voting securities added to the Escrow Fund in
respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock).

                                     -53-
<PAGE>

     (d) Claims Upon Escrow Fund.
         -----------------------

            (i)  Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent at any time on or before the
last day of the Escrow Period of a certificate signed by any officer of Parent
(an "Officer's Certificate"): (A) stating that Parent has paid, sustained or
properly accrued or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay, sustain or
accrue Losses, and (B) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of
Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid,
sustained or properly accrued, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and
the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which
such item is related, the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the provisions of
Section 7.2(e) hereof, deliver to Parent out of the Escrow Fund, as promptly as
practicable, shares of Parent Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund in an amount
equal to such Losses.

            (ii) For the purposes of determining the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock to be delivered to Parent out of the Escrow Fund pursuant to
Section 7.2(d)(i) hereof, each share of Parent Common Stock shall be deemed to
have a value equal to the average closing price of a share of Parent Common
Stock for the ten trading days ending on the date of the Officer's Certificate
in question.

     (e)  Objections to Claims.  At the time of delivery of any Officer's
          --------------------
Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such certificate shall be
delivered to the Securityholder Agent (as defined in Section 7.2(g)) and for a
period of thirty (30) days after such delivery, the Escrow Agent shall make no
delivery to Parent of any Escrow Amounts pursuant to Section 7.2(d) hereof
unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from the
Securityholder Agent to make such delivery.  After the expiration of such thirty
(30)-day period, the Escrow Agent shall make delivery of shares of Parent Common
Stock from the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 7.2(d) hereof, provided
that no such payment or delivery may be made if the Securityholder Agent shall
object in a written statement to the claim made in the Officer's Certificate,
and such statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the
expiration of such thirty (30)-day period.

     (f)  Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration.
          ------------------------------------

            (i)  In case the Securityholder Agent shall so object in writing to
any claim or claims made in any Officer's Certificate within 30 days after
delivery of such Officer's Certificate, the Securityholder Agent and Parent
shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties
with respect to each of such claims. If the Securityholder Agent and Parent
should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and
signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and distribute shares of
Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.

            (ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith
negotiation, either Parent or the Securityholder Agent may demand arbitration of
the matter unless the amount of the damage or loss is at issue in pending
litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced
until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration; and in
either

                                     -54-
<PAGE>

such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by one
arbitrator mutually agreeable to Parent and Securityholder Agent. In the event
that within forty-five (45) days after submission of any dispute to arbitration,
Parent and the Securityholder Agent cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator,
within fifteen (15) days after the end of such forty-five (45) day period Parent
and the Securityholder Agent shall each select one arbitrator. The two
arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. If the Securityholder
Agent does not select an arbitrator during this fifteen (15) day period, then
the parties agree that there shall be one arbitrator selected by Parent. If
Parent does not select an arbitrator during this fifteen (15) day period, then
the parties agree that there shall be one arbitrator selected by the
Securityholder Agent. The arbitrator or arbitrators shall set a limited time
period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for
discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole
judgement of the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case
may be, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the
subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit
discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys'
fees and costs, to the same extent as a court of competent law or equity, should
the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be,
determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that
discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification. The
decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the
validity and amount of any claim in such Officer's Certificate shall be binding
and conclusive upon the parties. Such decision shall be written and shall be
supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the
award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s)
shall have the authority to award Parent more than that requested in the
Officer's Certificate.

            (iii)  Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in
Santa Clara, California under the rules then in effect of the American
Arbitration Association. The arbitrator(s) shall determine how all expenses
relating to the arbitration shall be paid, including without limitation, the
respective expenses of each party, the fees of the arbitrator(s) and the
administrative fee of the American Arbitration Association.

     (g) Securityholder Agent of the Stockholders; Power of Attorney.  In the
         -----------------------------------------------------------
event that the Merger is approved, effective upon such vote, and without further
act of any Company Stockholder, J. Markham Green shall be appointed as agent and
attorney-in-fact (the "Securityholder Agent") for each Company Stockholder
(except such stockholders, if any, as shall have perfected their appraisal or
dissenters' rights under Delaware Law), for and on behalf of the Company
Stockholders, to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize
delivery to Parent of shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in
satisfaction of claims by Parent, to object to such deliveries, to agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and
comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such
claims, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of
Securityholder Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing.  Such agency may
be changed by the Company Stockholders from time to time upon not less than
thirty (30) days prior written notice to Parent; provided that the

                                     -55-
<PAGE>

Securityholder Agent may not be removed unless holders of a two-thirds interest
of the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted
agent.  Any vacancy in the position of Securityholder Agent may be filled by
approval of the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund.  No bond
shall be required of the Securityholder Agent, and the Securityholder Agent
shall not receive compensation for his or her services.  Notices or
communications to or from the Securityholder Agent shall constitute notice to or
from each of the Company Stockholders.

     (h) Actions of the Securityholder Agent.  A decision, act, consent or
         -----------------------------------
instruction of the Securityholder Agent shall constitute a decision of all the
Company Stockholders for whom a portion of the Escrow Amount otherwise issuable
to them are deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each of such Company Stockholder, and the Escrow Agent and
Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Securityholder Agent as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each
such Company Stockholder.  The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from
any liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholder Agent.

     (i) Third-Party Claims.  In the event Parent becomes aware of a third-party
         ------------------
claim which Parent believes may result in a demand against the Escrow Fund,
Parent shall notify the Securityholder Agent of such claim, and the
Securityholder Agent, as representative for the stockholders of the Company,
shall be entitled, at their expense, to participate in any defense of such
claim.  Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to settle any such
claim; provided, however, that except with the consent of the Securityholder
Agent, no settlement of any such claim with third-party claimants shall alone be
determinative of the amount of any claim against the Escrow Fund.  In the event
that the Securityholder Agent has consented to any such settlement, the
Securityholder Agent shall have no power or authority to object under any
provision of this Article VII to the amount of any claim by Parent against the
Escrow Fund with respect to such settlement.

     (j) Escrow Agent's Duties.
         ---------------------

            (i)  The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of
such duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any
additional written escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive after
the date of this Agreement which are signed by an officer of Parent and the
Securityholder Agent, and may rely and shall be protected in relying or
refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and
to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.  The Escrow
Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Escrow Agent
while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any
act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive
evidence of such good faith.

            (ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to comply with
and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court of law, notwithstanding any
notices, warnings or other communications from any party or any other person to
the contrary.  In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order,
judgment or decree of any court, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of
the parties hereto or to any other person by reason of such compliance,

                                     -56-
<PAGE>

notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being subsequently reversed,
modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered without
jurisdiction.

          (iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on
account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or
delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents
or papers deposited or called for hereunder.

          (iv)  The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any
rights under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any
documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.

          (v)   In performing any duties under the Agreement, the Escrow Agent
shall not be liable to any party for damages, losses, or expenses, except for
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent.  The
Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to
act made or omitted in good faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted in
reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement or affidavit
provided for in this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe
to be genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries,
fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any representative authority.
In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult with the legal counsel in connection
with Escrow Agent's duties under this Agreement and shall be fully protected in
any act taken, suffered, or permitted by him/her in good faith in accordance
with the advice of counsel.  The Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining
and verifying the authority of any person acting or purporting to act on behalf
of any party to this Agreement.

          (vi)  If any controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement,
or with any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its
terms or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the
controversy or to take any action regarding it.  The Escrow Agent may hold all
documents and shares of Parent Common Stock and may wait for settlement of any
such controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in
the Escrow Agent's discretion, the Escrow Agent may be required, despite what
may be set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.  In such event, the Escrow Agent
will not be liable for damage.  Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at its option,
file an action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any
claims and rights among themselves.  The Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit
with the clerk of the court all documents and shares of Parent Common Stock held
in escrow, except all cost, expenses, charges and reasonable attorney fees
incurred by the Escrow Agent due to the interpleader action and which the
parties jointly and severally agree to pay.  Upon initiating such action, the
Escrow Agent shall be fully released and discharged of and from all obligations
and liability imposed by the terms of this Agreement.

          (vii) Parent and the Company agree to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent
harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses,
including reasonable costs of investigation, counsel fees, and disbursements
that may be imposed on Escrow Agent or incurred by Escrow Agent in connection
with the performance of his/her duties under this

                                     -57-
<PAGE>

Agreement, including but not limited to any litigation arising from this
Agreement or involving its subject matter.

               (viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at
least thirty (30) days written notice to the parties; provided, however, that no
such resignation shall become effective until the appointment of a successor
escrow agent which shall be accomplished as follows: the parties shall use their
best efforts to mutually agree on a successor escrow agent within thirty (30)
days after receiving such notice. If the parties fail to agree upon a successor
escrow agent within such time, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to appoint
a successor escrow agent authorized to do business in the State of California.
The successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting
such appointment and it shall, without further acts, be vested with all the
estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor escrow agent
as if originally named as escrow agent. The Escrow Agent shall be discharged
from any further duties and liability under this Agreement.

          (k) Fees.  All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties
              ----
hereunder shall be paid by Parent.  It is understood that the fees and usual
charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered
compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement.  In the
event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if
the Escrow Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement, or if
the parties request a substantial modification of its terms, or if any
controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in,
any litigation pertaining to this escrow or its subject matter, the Escrow Agent
shall be reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed
for all costs, attorney's fees, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay,
controversy or litigation.  Parent promises to pay these sums upon demand.

          (l) Exclusive Remedy.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
              ----------------
Agreement to the contrary, if the Merger is consummated and a Closing occurs,
other than for Losses arising out of claims based on fraud, the payment of
Losses from the Escrow Fund shall be Parent's and Merger Sub's exclusive remedy
under this Agreement.

     7.3  Adjustment to Consideration.
          ---------------------------

          (a) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Parent may, at
its election, cause to be prepared and delivered to the Securityholder Agent a
statement reflecting the Cash Amount of the Surviving Corporation on the Closing
Date Balance Sheet (the "Final Cash Balance").  In the event that, pursuant to
the terms of this Section 7.3, it is determined that the Final Cash Balance is
less than the lesser of the applicable Minimum Cash Balance for such Closing
Date as determined pursuant to Section 5.27 and the Cash Amount reflected on the
Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet, then an amount equal to such difference
shall be paid to Parent out of the Escrow Fund upon the delivery to the Escrow
Agent of an Officer's Certificate.  Following delivery by Parent to the
Securityholder Agent of the Final Cash Balance, Parent shall give, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to give, to the Securityholder Agent reasonable
access during Parent's business hours to those books and records of the
Surviving Corporation in the possession of Parent

                                     -58-
<PAGE>

or the Surviving Corporation and any personnel which relate to the preparation
of the Final Cash Balance for purposes of resolving any disputes concerning the
Final Cash Balance.

          (b) The Securityholder Agent shall have thirty (30) days following
delivery of the Final Cash Balance during which to notify Parent in writing (the
"Notice of Objection") of any good faith objections to the calculation of Final
 -------------------
Cash Balance, setting forth a reasonably specific and detailed description of
its objections and the dollar amount of each objection.  If the Securityholder
Agent objects to Parent's calculation of Final Cash Balance, Parent and the
Securityholder Agent shall attempt to resolve any such objections within fifteen
(15) days of the receipt by Parent of the Notice of Objection.

          (c) If Parent and the Securityholder Agent are unable to resolve any
such dispute within the thirty (30) day period referred to in Section 7.3(b)
above, Parent and the Securityholder Agent shall submit the dispute to Deloitte
& Touche LLP (the "Independent Accounting Firm").  Each of the parties to this
Agreement shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates and representatives
to, provide full cooperation to the Independent Accounting Firm.  The
Independent Accounting Firm shall (x) act in its capacity as an expert and not
as an arbitrator, (y) consider only those matters as to which there is a dispute
between the parties and (z) be instructed to reach its conclusions regarding any
such dispute within thirty (30) days after its appointment and provide a written
explanation of its decision.  In the event that Parent and the Securityholder
Agent submit any dispute to an Independent Accounting Firm, each such party may
submit a "position paper" to the Independent Accounting Firm setting forth the
position of such party with respect to such dispute, to be considered by such
Independent Accounting Firm as it deems fit.  Fifty percent (50%) of any
expenses relating to the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
paid by Parent and fifty percent (50%) of such expenses shall be paid from the
Escrow Fund.

     If the Securityholder Agent does not deliver the Notice of Objection in
accordance with Section 7.3(c) above (i.e., within a thirty day period), the
Final Cash Balance, shall be deemed to have been accepted by all of the parties
to this Agreement.  In the event that the Securityholder Agent delivers a Notice
of Objection in accordance with the provisions above and Parent and the
Securityholder Agent are able to resolve such dispute by mutual agreement,
Parent's calculation of the Final Cash Balance, to the extent modified by mutual
agreement of such parties, shall be deemed to have been accepted by all of the
parties to this Agreement.  In the event that the Securityholder Agent delivers
a Notice of Objection in accordance with the provisions set forth above and
Parent and the Securityholder Agent are unable to resolve such dispute by mutual
agreement, the determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final
and binding on the parties and Parent's calculation of the Cash Amount on the
Closing Date Balance Sheet, to the extent modified by the Independent Accounting
Firm, shall be deemed to have been accepted by all of the parties to this
Agreement.  Subject to the foregoing provisions, the calculations of the Final
Cash Balance shall be conclusive and binding on all of the parties to this
Agreement, no further adjustments shall be made thereto and neither Parent nor
the Securityholder Agent shall have any further right to challenge such
calculation of the Final Cash Balance.

business of the Company or (ii) compel Parent or the Company to dispose of or

Parent as a result of the Merger;

            (d) by Parent if Parent is not in material breach of its obligations

Directors (as applicable) of the party taking such action.
