(the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of OMelveny and Myers LLP, 2765
Sand Hill Road, Menlo Park, California 94025 at 5:00 a.m. Menlo Park,

permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such

as Parent and the Company may mutually agree consistent with Delaware Law (the
"Closing Date").

 

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a
certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
and make all other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in

(the "Effective Time") as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as may be
specified in the certificate of merger).

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects
set forth in Section 259 of Delaware Law. 

Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the parties hereto or the holders thereof:

(i) except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.02(a)(ii)_, 
_Section_ __ _ 2.02(a)(iii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.04_, each share of Company
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be

right to receive $24.50 in cash, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration");

 

(ii) each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or
owned by Parent or Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto;

 

(iii) each share of Company Stock held by any Subsidiary of Parent (other
than Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into such number of shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Person owns the same
percentage of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time as such Person owned of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time; and

 

(iv) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one share of

 



11

    

 common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with
the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and,
together with the shares described in  _Section_ __ _ 2.02(a)(iii)_, and
shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(b) If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, division, subdivision or combination, exchange
or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock
distribution thereon with a record date during such period, but excluding any
change that results from any exercise of options or the vesting of restricted
share units outstanding as of the date hereof to purchase shares of Company
Stock granted under the Companys stock option or compensation plans or
arrangements that are permitted by this Agreement, the Merger Consideration
and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be
appropriately adjusted.

 

Section 2.03. _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent") for the purpose of exchanging
for the Merger Consideration (A) certificates representing shares of Company
Stock (the "Certificates") or (B) uncertificated shares of Company Stock
(the "Uncertificated Shares"). Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no
event later than two (2) Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall
send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to each holder of
Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares
of Company Stock and whose shares were converted into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.02_ a letter of transmittal (in a form that was
reasonably acceptable to the Company prior to the Effective Time) and
instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent)
for use in such exchange.

(b) Each holder of Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, the Merger Consideration. Payment of the
Merger Consideration, in each case to which such holders are entitled pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement with respect to Uncertificated Shares shall be
made promptly following the Effective Time without any action on the part of
the person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered, except as
may be required by the Paying Agent (including in respect of any applicable
tax forms or other documentation required to be delivered by such holder). No
interest shall be paid or accrued with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon surrender of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.

 

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company
Stock, an aggregate amount of cash comprising the amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash referred to as the "Payment Fund").
The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than for the purpose
provided for in this Agreement and shall be held in trust for the benefit of

 



12

    

 the holders of Company Stock entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the terms of _Section_ __ _ 2.02_. The Payment Fund shall,
pending its disbursement to the holders of Company Stock and subject to the
applicable requirements of the Paying Agent, be invested by the Paying Agent
as directed by Parent or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii)
short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United
States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and
interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the highest quality by
either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings
Services, or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks reasonably acceptable to
the Company; provided that no such investment or losses shall affect the
amounts payable to such holders of Company Stock and Parent shall promptly
replace or cause to be replaced any funds deposited with the Paying Agent that
are lost through any investment so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at
all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to pay the
Merger Consideration. Earnings from investments, subject to the immediately
preceding proviso, shall be paid to and shall be the sole and exclusive
property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. Except as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 2.03(g)_ hereof, the Payment Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose.

 

(d) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result
of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of
the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(e) At the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock and the holders of Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares that evidenced shares of Company Stock prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Company Stock, other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented
to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _Article 2_.

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying
Agent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_ that remains unclaimed by the
holders of shares of Company Stock 12 months after the Effective Time shall be
returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged
shares of Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 2.03_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of the Merger Consideration, in respect of such shares without
any interest thereon, as general creditors thereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock
for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders
of shares of Company Stock immediately prior to such time when such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority
shall become, to the extent 

 



13

    

 permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying
Agent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ in respect of any Appraisal Shares
shall be returned to Parent, upon demand.

Section 2.04.  _Appraisal Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 2.02_,
shares of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares of Company Stock canceled in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 2.02(a)(ii)_) and held by a holder who has not voted in
favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares of Company
Stock pursuant to, and who complies, in all respects, with Delaware Law (such
shares being referred to collectively as the "Appraisal Shares" until such
time as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such
holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law with respect to such shares)
shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but
instead shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Delaware Law
to Appraisal Shares; provided that if, after the Effective Time, such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses such
holders right to appraisal pursuant to Delaware Law, or if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to
the relief set forth in the Delaware Law in respect of appraisal, then the
right of such holder to receive such payment in respect of such Appraisal
Shares will cease and such shares of Company Stock will be deemed to
have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and will be exchangeable
solely for, the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.02(a)(_ _i_ _)_ , without interest thereon, upon
surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of
such Uncertificated Share, as the case may be. The Company shall provide
Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of shares of Company Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and
any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to Delaware Law that relates to such demand, and
Parent shall have the opportunity and right to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands under Delaware Law
consistent with the obligations of the Company thereunder. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with
respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

Section 2.05. _Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase
shares of Company Stock (other than any Company ESPP Rights) that is then
outstanding under any Company Stock Plan (a "Company Stock Option"), is then
vested (after giving effect to any accelerated vesting of the Company Stock
Option that may apply in the circumstances) (a "Vested Company Stock
Option"), and has an exercise price per share of Company Stock underlying such
Vested Company Stock Option (the "Option Exercise Price") that is less than
the Merger Consideration shall be canceled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess of the
Merger Consideration over the Option Exercise Price of such Vested Company
Stock Option by (ii) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such
Vested Company Stock Option (such amount, the "Option Consideration"). Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Option Consideration

 



14

    

 to the holders of the Vested Company Stock Options at or reasonably promptly
after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three (3) Business Days
after the Effective Time). At or immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each Company Stock Option that has an Option Exercise Price that is equal to
or greater than the Merger Consideration, whether or not exercisable or vested
(an "Out-of-the-Money Option"), shall be canceled without payment.

 

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option that is
then outstanding and unvested (after giving effect to any accelerated vesting
of the Company Stock Option that may apply in the circumstances) (an "Unvested
Company Stock Option") and is not an Out-of-the-Money Option shall be canceled
and converted into the right (each such right, a "Cash Option Award") to
receive an amount in cash, payable by the Surviving Corporation at the
respective times and subject to the contingencies specified herein, determined
by multiplying (i) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the Option
Exercise Price of such Unvested Company Stock Option by (ii) the number of
shares of Company Stock subject to such Unvested Company Stock Option. Such
amount shall be payable on the earliest of the following dates (but in no
event later than December 31 of the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs), in each case, subject to the holder remaining continuously employed
by or in service to Parent or its Affiliate from the Closing Date through the
applicable payment date: (x) the same vesting dates that applied to the
corresponding Unvested Company Stock Option, (y) the last regularly scheduled
payroll date of the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, and (z)
if applicable, the date on which the holders employment or service with
Parent and its Affiliates terminates, if the corresponding Unvested Company
Stock Option as in effect immediately prior to cancellation pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.05(b)_ (or an applicable agreement between the Company and
the holder of the Unvested Company Stock Option disclosed in _Section_ __ _
4.18(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) provided for accelerated vesting on
such termination. A holder of a Cash Option Award who has not remained
continuously employed with or in service to Parent or its Affiliate through
the applicable payment date shall permanently forfeit the unvested portion of
such Cash Option Award.

 

(c) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of restricted
stock units with respect to shares of Company Stock that is then outstanding
under a Company Stock Plan (each such award, a "Company RSU") and is then
vested (after giving effect to any accelerated vesting of the Company RSU that
may apply in the circumstances) shall be canceled and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of
Company Stock subject to such vested Company RSU award immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration (such amount,
the "RSU Consideration"). Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay
the RSU Consideration to the holders of the Company RSU awards at or
reasonably promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than
three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time).

(d) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is then
outstanding and unvested (after giving effect to any accelerated vesting of
the Company RSU that may apply in the circumstances) (an "Unvested Company
RSU") shall be canceled and converted into the right (each such right, a
"Cash RSU Award") to receive an amount in cash, payable by the Surviving
Corporation at the respective times and subject to the contingencies specified
herein, equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such
Unvested Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
(ii) the Merger Consideration. Such

 



15

    

 amount shall be payable on the same vesting schedule that applied to the
corresponding Unvested Company RSU, subject to the holder remaining
continuously employed by or in service to Parent or its Affiliate from the
Closing Date through the applicable vesting date, subject to any right to
vesting acceleration as was in effect with respect to such Unvested Company
RSU immediately prior to cancellation pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
2.05(d)_. A holder of a Cash RSU Award who has not remained continuously
employed with or in service to Parent or its Affiliate through a particular
vesting date, subject to any right to vesting acceleration, or who otherwise
does not satisfy the vesting requirements of such Cash RSU Award, shall
permanently forfeit the unvested portion of such Cash RSU Award that would
otherwise have vested on such vesting date.

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or,
if appropriate, any committee thereof administering any Company Stock Plan)
shall adopt such resolutions, or take action by written consent in lieu of a
meeting, as may be necessary to provide for the transactions contemplated by

forecasts, plans and budgets, that Parent and Merger Subsidiary are taking

who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at

 



47

    

 any time prior to the date of this Agreement, a present or former director,
officer, employee or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect to an
employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective predecessors (each, an "Indemnified Person") as provided in
the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, the Amended and
Restated Bylaws of the Company, the organizational documents of any

and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries
to, cause to be maintained in effect provisions in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and each of its

or investigation (a "Claim"), whether civil, criminal or administrative, based
in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining
to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Person is or was a director (including
in a capacity as a member of any board committee), officer, employee or agent
of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors prior to the Effective Time, or (ii) this Agreement or any of

before, on or after the Effective Time, against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Person to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law upon receipt of any undertaking required by
Applicable Law and an undertaking from such Person prior to the advancement
of any such amounts that such Indemnified Person shall reimburse the Surviving
Corporation any funds to which a court of competent jurisdiction has
determined, by a final, nonappealable order or judgment, such Indemnified
Person is not entitled), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or
in connection with any such threatened or actual Claim. Neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any threatened or actual Claim for which indemnification could be
sought by an Indemnified Person hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise
or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from
all liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified Person otherwise
consents in writing to

 



48

    

 such settlement, compromise or consent. Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cooperate with an Indemnified Person in the defense of any matter for
which such Indemnified Person could seek indemnification hereunder.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, or if the Company is

directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "DandO Insurance"), in
each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6)
years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to
any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time (including claims with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
hereby) from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable
than the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies with respect
to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act,
omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director
or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her
serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ that in no event shall the Company or shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to pay annual premiums for insurance under
this _Section_ __ _ 7.04(c)_ in excess of 300% of the most recent annual
premiums paid by the Company _prior to the date of this Agreement_ for such
purpose, it being understood that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, the Company shall be entitled to, or Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall nevertheless be obligated to, provide as much
coverage as may be obtained for such 300% amount.

assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not

and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall

7.04_ shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, under Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law, under
any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise. These rights shall survive consummation of the
Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Person. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
under this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a
manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person without the
consent of such Indemnified Person. 

(f) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_;
_provided_ that each Indemnified Person shall, prior to the advancement of
any

 



49

    

 such expenses, be required to provide a written undertaking to the Surviving
Corporation that such Indemnified Person shall reimburse the Surviving
Corporation any funds to which a court of competent jurisdiction has
determined by a final, nonappealable order or judgment such Indemnified Person
is not entitled hereunder.

and expenses of such Indemnified Person (including the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel) in advance of the final disposition of any action, suit,
proceeding or investigation that is the subject of the right to
indemnification, provided that such Person shall, prior to the receipt of any
such advancements, undertake to reimburse the Surviving Corporation for all
amounts so advanced if a court of competent jurisdiction determines, by a
final, nonappealable order or judgment, that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification.

Section 7.05. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) With respect to employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately before the Effective Time ("Company Employees"), Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, for the period of twelve (12) months

Company Employees employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
their Affiliates), provide to such Company Employee (i) base salary or wage
rate (as applicable), commission and target annual cash incentive opportunity
that in aggregate are not less favorable than the base salary or wage rate
(as applicable), commission and target annual cash incentive opportunity

(ii) employee benefits and equity awards that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to the employee benefits and equity awards provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates.

after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, assume, honor and continue during the twelve (12) month period
following the Effective Time or, if sooner, until all obligations thereunder
have been satisfied, all of the employment, bonus, commission, severance,
change in control, retention and termination plans and agreements maintained
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and set forth on _Schedule 7.05(b)_
, in each case, as in effect at the Effective Time, including with respect to
any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other
event), without any amendment or modification, other than any amendment or
modification permitted by the terms of the applicable plan or agreement or
required to comply with Applicable Law, or with the prior written consent of
the applicable Company Employee.

 

(c) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates, for purposes of vesting,
eligibility to participate, and level of benefits and, in the case of
severance, vacation and paid time-off, benefits and accruals, Parent shall
ensure that (subject only to the consent of the applicable insurance
provider, if required and which Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain) each Company Employees service with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (as well as service with any
predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent
service with the predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such
Subsidiary under

 



50

    

 the comparable Company Employee Plans) shall be treated as service with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_
, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits or with respect to
benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or any other
arrangement other than in respect of vacation, paid-time off or severance.

(d) Parent shall waive, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Affiliates to waive, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions,
actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit
plan maintained by the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates in which any Company Employee (or the dependents of any eligible
employee) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.
Parent shall recognize, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Affiliates to recognize, the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles
and similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her
eligible dependents) under the applicable Company Employee Plan during the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying
such years deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare
benefit plans in which such Company Employee will be eligible to participate
from and after the Effective Time.

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time (but not earlier than ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Effective Time), the Company shall (unless otherwise
instructed by Parent at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the
Effective Time) take all such actions necessary to terminate the participation
by the Company and its Subsidiaries in each US Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and that includes a cash or
deferred arrangement that is intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the
Code, effective no later than the day immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide Parent
with evidence that the participation by the Company and its Subsidiaries in
such plan(s) has been terminated.

 

(f) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the Company
shall provide Parent with an analysis as to whether any "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) could receive payments
under any Company Employee Plan in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or together with
any other event, including a termination of employment) that would not be
deductible under Section 280G of the Code. The Company shall consider in good
faith taking any actions reasonably requested by Parent to reduce
or eliminate the amount of any "excess parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280G of the Code); _provided_ , _that_ in no event shall the Company
or any disqualified individual be required to reduce such
disqualified individuals payment or consideration as a result thereof.

(g) Without limiting the generality of  _Section_ __ _ 11.06_, nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ shall create any right in any Person, including any
employees, former employees, any participant in any Company Employee Plan or
any beneficiary thereof, nor create any right to continued employment with
Parent, Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates, nor be
construed in any way as modifying or amending the provisions of any Company
Employee Plan or any benefits plan maintained by Parent or any of its
Affiliates.

(i) the Merger has not been consummated on or before January 27, 2020 (as
such date may be extended pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.13_ or the two

proviso);

 

(ii) if any Restraint shall be in effect permanently restraining, enjoining
or otherwise permanently prohibiting the consummation of the Merger on
substantially the

 



57

    

 terms contemplated by this Agreement, and such Restraint shall have become
final and nonappealable; provided that the right to terminate this Agreement

have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) any Person (other than
by Parent, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives (in such capacities)) shall have first publicly announced an

Business Days (or if the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled to be held

the Company Board Recommendation on more than one occasion with respect to
each such publicly announced Acquisition Proposal by any Third Party or on
more than one occasion with respect to each publicly announced material
modification thereto; or

 

(ii) if there is any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by
the Company in this Agreement or any breach, violation or failure to perform
any covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this
Agreement, which inaccuracy, breach, violation or failure, either individually
or in the aggregate, if continuing at the Closing (A) would cause the
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.02(a)_ not to be satisfied, and (B)
is incapable of being cured by the End Date (a "Company Terminating Breach");
provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 10.01(c)(ii)_ shall not be available to Parent if a Parent
Terminating Breach shall have occurred and be continuing at the time Parent
delivers notice of its election to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

Company pays the Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
10.02(b)(ii)_; or

 



58

    

(ii) there is any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by
Parent or Merger Subsidiary in this Agreement or any breach, violation or
failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger
Subsidiary set forth in this Agreement which inaccuracy, breach, violation
or failure, either individually or in the aggregate, if continuing at the
Closing (A) would cause the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.03(a)_
not to be satisfied, and (B) is incapable of being cured by the End Date (a
"Parent Terminating Breach"); _provided_ that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.01(d)(ii)_ shall not be
available to the Company if a Company Terminating Breach shall have occurred
and be continuing at the time the Company delivers notice of its election to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.01(d)(ii)_.

 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01

(ii) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 10.01(d)(_ _i_ _)_ , then the Company shall pay the Company Termination
Fee to Parent in immediately available funds substantially concurrently with
(and as a condition to) such termination.

 

(iii) If (A) after the date of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal shall have been publicly made, publicly announced or otherwise
communicated to the Board of Directors of the Company or to the Company or
shall have been made directly to the stockholders of the Company generally
(and in, any such case, such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn), (B)
thereafter, this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 10.01(b)(i)_ (at a time when Parent could have terminated this
Agreement pursuant to such provision),  _Section_ __ _ 10.01(b)(iii)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 10.01(c)(ii)_, and (C) within twelve (12) months after such
termination, the Company consummates any Acquisition Proposal or enters into a
definitive agreement in respect of any

 



59

    

 Acquisition Proposal that is later consummated, then the Company shall pay
to Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds on
the date of consummation of such Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 10.02(b)_, all references to "20%" in the definition of

(iv) In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(v) Parent and Merger Subsidiary agree that, upon any termination of this
Agreement under circumstances where the Company Termination Fee is payable by
the Company pursuant to this Section and such Company Termination Fee is paid
in full, except in the case of fraud or a willful and material breach of
the Companys representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement prior to termination of this Agreement, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall be precluded from any other remedy against the Company, at
law or in equity or otherwise, and neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary shall
seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including
consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the Company or any of
the Companys Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, partners, managers, members, stockholders or Affiliates or their
respective Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 10.02(b)_ are an integral part of the

results in a judgment against the Company for the amounts set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 10.02(b)_, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 10.02(b)_ from the date of termination of this Agreement at a

Section 11.02. _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
Agreements_. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained herein and in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant
hereto shall not survive the Effective Time; provided that this Section 11.02
shall not limit any covenant or agreement by the parties that by its terms
contemplates performance after the Effective Time.

Section 11.03. _Amendments and Waivers_. (a) Any provision of this Agreement
may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party
against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided, however, that after the

representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other provisions hereof
of the relevant party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this

other provisions hereof of such party that is contained in this Agreement,
but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) such representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements and other provisions hereof, would be reasonably apparent on the
face of such disclosure. The mere inclusion of an item in the Company
Disclosure Letter as an exception to a representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or other provision hereof shall not be deemed an admission that
such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item would have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 11.06. _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment._

 



62

    

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to

successors and permitted assigns.

 

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer, by operation of
law or otherwise, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the consent of each other party hereto, except that Parent or Merger
Subsidiary may transfer or assign all (but not less than all) of its rights
and obligations under this Agreement to one of its wholly owned Subsidiaries
at any time; provided that such transfer or assignment shall not relieve
Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or
change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to Parent or
Merger Subsidiary. Any purported assignment not permitted under this
_Section_ __ _ 11.06(b)_ shall be null and void.

suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement, the other
agreements contemplated hereby or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each of
Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company agrees to commence any action, suit
or proceeding relating hereto either in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, New Castle County or if such suit, action or other proceeding may
not be brought in such court for jurisdictional reasons, in the United States
District Court in Wilmington, Delaware. Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and
the Company further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document by U.S. registered mail to such partys respective address set forth

proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has submitted
to jurisdiction in this Section 11.08. Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and
the Company irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the
laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in (i) the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware, New Castle County, or (ii) the United States
District Court in Wilmington, Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum. Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company
irrevocably waives any objections or immunities to jurisdiction to which it
may otherwise be entitled or become entitled (including sovereign immunity,
immunity to pre-judgment attachment, post-judgment attachment and execution)
in any legal suit, action or proceeding against it arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby which is instituted
in any such court. The parties agree that a final trial court judgment in any
such suit, action or other proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by Applicable Law; provided, however, that nothing in the foregoing shall
restrict any partys

 



63

    

 rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such
final trial court judgment. Each of the parties hereto agrees that service of
process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at
the addresses set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.01_ shall be effective service
of process for any suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court. The

registered mail, return receipt requested, or by reputable overnight courier
service, directed to the other party at the addresses set forth herein in

any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed
by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party
shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other
oral or written agreement or other communication). Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile, ".pdf" format
or scanned pages shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed

(b) Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article 4,
each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledges that neither the Company
nor any Person on behalf of the Company makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information made available to
Parent or Merger Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any other Person will have or be
subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to Parent, Merger
Subsidiary or any other Person resulting from the distribution to Parent or
Merger Subsidiary, or Parents or Merger Subsidiarys use of, any such
information, including any information, documents, projections, forecasts or
other material made available to Parent or Merger Subsidiary in certain "data
rooms" or management presentations in expectation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, unless, and then only to the extent that, any
such information is expressly included in a representation or warranty
contained in Article 4.

(c) Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article 5,
the Company acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any other
Person on behalf of Parent or Merger Subsidiary makes any other express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Subsidiary
or with respect to any other information made available to the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 11.12. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

Section 11.13. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not
be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The
parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the courts described in _Section_ __ _ 11.08_ without
proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled under this Agreement at law or in equity, and the
right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither the Company
nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties
hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 11.13_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. If, prior to the End Date, any
party brings any suit, action or proceeding, in each case in accordance with
Section 11.08, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, the End Date shall
automatically be extended by (A) the amount of time during which such suit,
action or proceeding is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days or (B) such
other time period established by the court presiding over such suit, action
or proceeding, as the case may be.
