or with notice or passage of time, would result in or give rise to a default
or breach by any Buyer of such Assigned

 



      
 

 



 

Contract; (D) any indemnification (or similar) obligation under and pursuant
to Assigned Contracts to the extent arising from any facts, events, actions,
or circumstances that occurred or failed to occur prior to the Effective Time;
and (E) any Assigned Contract with respect to the operation of the Business in
Australia and New Zealand; (ii) accrued customer rebates (excluding customers
in Australia and New Zealand) arising exclusively or primarily from the
operations of the Business in the Ordinary Course of Business prior to the
Effective Time, to the extent, but only to the extent, the same are accrued on
the Final Closing Balance Sheet; and (iii) except with respect to customers in
Australia and New Zealand, all Liabilities under warranties given by Seller in
the Ordinary Course of Business prior to the Effective Time and the
obligations with respect to product returns set forth in _Section 7.3_ in
each case under this clause (iii) to the extent, but only to the extent, the
same are accrued on, or reflected in the allowances on, the Final Closing
Balance Sheet (collectively, the " _Assumed Liabilities_ ").

 



 

1.4. _Retained Liabilities_. Except for the Assumed Liabilities, Buyer is not
assuming and expressly disclaims the assumption of any Liabilities of Seller
and its Affiliates (all Liabilities of Seller and its Affiliates other than
the Assumed Liabilities are referred to herein as the " _Retained Liabilities_
"). For greater certainty, the Retained Liabilities include all vendor
payables and accrued compensation arising out of the operation of the
Business, notwithstanding that such items were taken into account when
determining the amount of the Target Modified Net Working Capital.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 2 
PURCHASE PRICE**

 



 

2.1. _Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) The consideration for the Purchased Assets (the " _Purchase Price_ ") will
be (i)One Hundred Twenty Million Dollars($120,000,000.00) (as may be further
adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.3_) (the " _Cash Consideration_ "); and (ii)
the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

(b) The Purchase Price shall be allocated amongst the Purchased Assets as
follows:

 



 

(i) US$2,000,000 (the " _Canadian Consideration_ ") for the Canadian Purchased
Assets;

 



 

(ii) US$1,500,000 (the " _European Consideration_ ") for the European
Purchased Assets; and

 



 

(iii) the remainder of the Purchase Price for the other Purchased Assets.

 



 

2.2. _Tax Allocation_.

 



 

(a) Buyer and Seller will allocate the purchase price for the Purchased Assets
in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 1060 of the Code and
the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _U.S. Price
Allocation"_ ). Within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
provide Seller with statements (" _Price_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Allocation Statement_ ") containing Buyers proposed U.S. Price Allocation
(" _Price Allocation_ "). If Seller does not notify Buyer that Seller objects
to Buyers proposed Price Allocation within twenty (20) days after delivery
thereof, Buyers proposed Price Allocation shall be deemed the " _Final Price
Allocation_ ". If within twenty (20) days after the delivery of the Price
Allocation Statement, Seller notifies Buyer that Seller objects to Buyers
proposed Price Allocation contained in the Price Allocation Statement, Buyer
and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute within twenty
(20) days of Buyers notification and the Price Allocation agreed to by Buyer
and Seller shall be deemed the Final Price Allocation. Each of Buyer and
Seller shall prepare and timely file all Tax Returns, including, without
limitation, IRS Form 8594 (and all supplements thereto) reflecting the Final
Price Allocation for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date and to
make any timely filing required by applicable state or local laws. None of
Buyer and Seller shall take any position inconsistent with the Final Price
Allocation in the preparation of financial statements, the filing of any Tax
Returns or in the course of any audit by any Taxing Authority, Tax review or
Tax proceeding relating to any Tax Returns. In the event that Buyer and Seller
are unable to agree to a Final Purchase Price Allocation, there shall be no
Final Purchase Price Allocation and the prior two sentences shall not apply.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto shall allocate the Canadian Consideration in accordance
with the fair market value of each of the Canadian Purchased Assets (the "
_Canadian Price Allocation_ "). Prior to Closing, Buyer and Seller shall agree
on the Canadian Price Allocation, provided that if within ten (10) days prior
to the expected Closing Date, Buyer and Seller do not so agree, they shall
jointly hire a third party valuation firm to determine, prior to Closing, the
Canadian Price Allocation (as agreed to or determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.2(b)_ the " _Final Canadian Price Allocation_ "). The parties
shall allocate the Canadian Purchase Price in accordance with the Final
Canadian Price Allocation. The parties shall not take any position
inconsistent with such allocation in the preparation of financial statements,
the filing of any Tax Returns or in the course of any audit by any Authority,
Tax review or Tax proceeding relating to any Tax Returns.

 



 

2.3. _Balance Sheet Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) The amount of Cash Consideration shall be adjusted on the Closing Date in
accordance with this _Section 2.3(a)_:

 



 

(i) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the scheduled Closing Date,
Seller shall provide US Buyer with a good faith estimate of the Closing
Modified Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time (" _Seller s
Estimate_"), and a calculation, as applicable, of the amount by which the
Target Modified Net Working Capital is greater than Sellers Estimate or the
amount by which the Target Modified Net Working Capital is less than Sellers
Estimate. US Buyer shall have three (3) Business Days to propose reasonable
adjustments to Sellers Estimate in good faith (the Sellers Estimate, as such
amount would be adjusted per Buyers proposal, the " _Buyer s Estimate_"). If
Seller disagrees with Buyers

 



      
 

 



 

Estimate, Seller and US Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to immediately
resolve any disputes regarding the estimated amount.

 



 

(ii) The " _Estimated Modified Net Working Capital_ " shall mean either the
amount, if any, agreed to by Seller and US Buyer or if Seller and US Buyer are
unable to resolve the disagreement prior to the scheduled Closing, then the
arithmetic average of Sellers Estimate and Buyers Estimate.

 



 

(iii) If the Estimated Modified Net Working Capital exceeds Target Modified
Net Working Capital, then the Cash Consideration paid at Closing will be
increased dollar for dollar by such excess or if the Target Modified Net
Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Modified Net Working Capital, then the
Cash Consideration paid at Closing will be decreased dollar for dollar by such
excess.

 



 

(b) The Cash Consideration paid by Buyers will be adjusted as provided in
_Section 2.3(b)(iv)_ below (any such adjustment, the " _Closing Adjustment
Amount_ ").

 



 

(i) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, US Buyer will deliver to Seller a
balance sheet of the Business as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance
Sheet_ ") and a calculation of the Closing Modified Net Working Capital as at
the Effective Time in each case prepared in conformity with the Accounting
Principles together with supporting schedules, analyses and work papers, if
any, supporting the Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Buyer s Closing
Estimate_").

 



 

(ii) Seller will have thirty (30) days after its receipt of US Buyers Closing
Estimate to notify US Buyer in writing of any objections to US Buyers Closing
Estimate), specifying in reasonable detail the nature of and basis for each
objection (a " _Balance Sheet Objection Notice_ "). Seller (and Sellers
accountants and other designated representatives) will be given reasonable
access to all relevant books, records and employees of US Buyer (and of US
Buyers accountants) to the extent reasonably required to complete its review
of US Buyers Closing Estimate. Any such Balance Sheet Objection Notice will
specify those individual line items in US Buyers Closing Estimate with which
Seller disagrees and the items, facts, amounts, calculations, or valuations
used to determine such line items. Seller will be deemed to have agreed with
all line items or amounts contained in US Buyers Closing Estimate and all
calculations, items, facts, amounts or valuations that are identified with
reasonable specificity in US Buyers Closing Estimate and used in determining
any line item of US Buyers Closing Estimate unless, and only to the extent,
such items, facts, amounts, calculations or valuations are specifically and
timely objected to in a Balance Sheet Objection Notice. If Seller fails to
timely deliver a Balance Sheet Objection Notice, Seller will be deemed to have
accepted and agreed to US Buyers Closing Estimate. If Seller timely delivers
a Balance Sheet Objection Notice, Seller and US Buyer will, within 30 days
following the date of such notice (the " _Balance Sheet Resolution Period_ "),
attempt in good faith to resolve their differences, and any resolution agreed
to between them in writing as to disputed

 



      
 

 



 

items will be final, binding and conclusive on, and nonappealable by, the
parties hereto.

 



 

(iii) If, at the conclusion of the Balance Sheet Resolution Period, Seller and
US Buyer have not reached an agreement regarding Sellers objections, then all
issues set forth in the Balance Sheet Objection Notice remaining in dispute or
the items in dispute pursuant to this _Section 2.3(b)_, may, at the election
of either Seller or US Buyer, be submitted for resolution to the New York
office of Grant Thornton LLP or, if the New York office of Grant Thornton is
unwilling or unable to serve in such capacity, a Neutral Auditor. Each party
agrees to execute, if requested by the Neutral Auditor, a reasonable
engagement letter. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be
performed by the Neutral Auditor will be borne by Seller and US Buyer based on
the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to such
party bears to the amount actually contested by the parties. Except as
provided in the preceding sentences, all other costs and expenses incurred by
the parties in connection with resolving any dispute before the Neutral
Auditor will be borne by the party incurring such costs and expenses. The
Neutral Auditor will act as an arbitrator to determine, based solely on the
presentations by Seller and US Buyer (which will be deemed to include any work
papers, records, accounts or similar materials delivered to the Neutral
Auditor by US Buyer or Seller in connection with such presentations and any
materials delivered to the Neutral Auditor in response to requests by the
Neutral Auditor), and not by independent review, only those specific line
items and amounts in US Buyers Closing Estimate to which Seller has timely
objected pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)(ii)_ and which US Buyer and Seller have
been unable to resolve. Each of US Buyer and Seller will use its reasonable
best efforts to make its presentation as promptly as practicable following
submission to the Neutral Auditor of the disputed items, and each such party
will be entitled, as part of its presentation, to respond to the presentation
of the other party and any question or requests of the Neutral Auditor. The
Neutral Auditor will be instructed by US Buyer and Seller to deliver its
determination within thirty (30) days of its engagement (which engagement will
be made no later than three (3) Business Days after an election by either
Seller or US Buyer to submit the objections to the Neutral Auditor) or as soon
thereafter as possible. In deciding any matter, the Neutral Auditor (i) may
only assign values to items in dispute and such values must be the same as or
between the values asserted by US Buyer and Seller; (ii) will make all
calculations in accordance with the Accounting Principles; and (iii) will be
bound by the express terms of this Agreement, including this section, and the
definitions contained herein. The Neutral Auditors determination (i) will be
set forth in a written statement delivered to Seller and US Buyer; (ii) will
be final, binding and conclusive on, and nonappealable by, the parties hereto
(except in the case of fraud); and (iii) will be enforceable as a judgment in
any court of competent jurisdiction. The term " _Final Closing Balance Sheet_
" means the definitive Closing Balance Sheet agreed (or deemed agreed) upon
between Seller and US Buyer in accordance with _Section 2.3(b)(ii)_ or, if
Seller and US Buyer do not reach agreement in accordance with _Section
2.3(b)(ii)_, the definitive Closing Balance Sheet resulting from the
determination made by the Neutral Auditor in

 



      
 

 



 

accordance with this _Section 2.3(b)(iii)_ (in addition to those items
theretofore agreed to between Seller and US Buyer).

 



 

(iv) If the Closing Modified Net Working Capital (as reflected on the Final
Closing Balance Sheet) exceeds Estimated Modified Net Working Capital, then
the Cash Consideration will be increased dollar for dollar by such excess or
if the Estimated Modified Net Working Capital exceeds the Closing Modified Net
Working Capital, then the Cash Consideration will be decreased dollar for
dollar by such excess. Any such increase or decrease is referred to as the "
_Final Adjustment Amount_ ".

 



 

(v) US Buyer or Seller, as applicable, will pay any Final Adjustment Amount in
full, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified
in writing by the receiving party within five (5) Business Days after the
Final Closing Balance Sheet is agreed (or deemed agreed) upon between US Buyer
and Seller or determined by the Neutral Auditor (the " _Due Date_ ") with
interest at a rate of four percent (4%) per annum from the Closing Date
through the Due Date. If any such payment is not paid when due, such payment
will include interest on the Final Adjustment Amount at the rate of five
percent (5%) per annum from the Due Date through the date on which payment is
made.

(a) To the extent that (i) any of the Purchased Assets (including, without
limitation, any Assigned Contracts and Permits) are not capable of being
assigned to Buyers at the Closing without the Consent of the issuer thereof or
any Third Party ( _i.e._ , any such purported assignment would be void under
the terms applicable to the Purchased Asset or under Applicable) or if such
assignment or attempted assignment would constitute a violation of any
applicable Law or (ii) any assignment of a Purchased Asset (including, without
limitation, any Assigned Contracts and Permits) to Buyers at the Closing would
constitute a breach of the Purchased Asset without the Consent of the

 



      
 

 



 

issuer thereof and the issuer thereof affirmatively asserts a claim of breach
as a result of such attempted assignment within twelve (12) months of the
Closing, then this Agreement will not constitute an assignment thereof, or an
attempted assignment, unless such Consent has been obtained. Seller will,
prior to the Closing, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
Consent or assignment to the applicable Buyer in a form and substance
reasonably acceptable to US Buyer; provided that nothing herein shall require
Seller to pay any consideration or agree to relinquish or modify any rights in

after the Closing, cooperate with US Buyer after the Closing with US Buyers
efforts to obtain such Consent(s) in a manner required under the terms of such
Assigned Contracts requiring Consent and to resolve the impracticalities of
assignment referred to in _Section 3.4(a)_ after the Closing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing herein shall require Seller to pay any consideration
or agree to relinquish or modify any rights in exchange for obtaining any
Consent from any Third Party.

 



 

(c) To the extent any Consents referred to in _Section 3.4(a)_ have not been
obtained by Seller prior to the Closing, until such time as such Consents are
obtained, Seller will (i) for a period of up to twelve (12) months after the
Closing provide the applicable Buyer the benefits of any Purchased Assets
referred to in _Section 3.4(a)_, (ii) for a period of up to twelve (12)
months after the Closing cooperate in any reasonable and lawful arrangement
designed to provide such benefits to such applicable Buyer, (iii) for a period
of up to twelve (12) months enforce for the account and benefit of such
applicable Buyer any and all rights of Seller arising from the Purchased
Assets referred to in _Section 3.4(a)_ against such issuer thereof and all

to _Section 3.4(a)_ of any Purchased Assets, such applicable Buyer will
perform, on behalf of Seller, for the benefit of the issuer thereof, all other
Third Parties thereto and/or any other Person, the obligations of Seller
thereunder or in connection therewith, but only to the extent that such
obligation would have been an Assumed Liability but for the non-assignability
or non-transferability thereof.

 



 

(e) The parties agree that they shall not proceed to Closing without any
Consent required under applicable Antitrust Laws.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 4 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER**

extent that a representation or warranty expressly states that such
representation or warranty is only as of an

 



      
 

 



 

earlier date) and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent that a
representation or warranty expressly states that such representation or
warranty is only as of an earlier date or the date of this Agreement) as set
forth in this _ARTICLE 4_, as supplemented by and subject to the exceptions
expressly set forth in the schedules to this _ARTICLE 4_ delivered to Buyer
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement as amended or
modified pursuant to _Section 6.1(d)_ (as so modified or amended together
with the schedules to _Section 6.1_, the " _Seller Disclosure Schedule_ ").
Any item, information or facts set forth in any section or subsection of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule (by cross-reference or otherwise) will be deemed to
disclose an exception to or qualify the related representation and warranty.
In addition, any item, information or facts disclosed in one section or
subsection of the Seller Disclosure Schedule will be deemed to be disclosed in
all other applicable sections or subsections of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
as an exception to other sections or subsections of this _ARTICLE 4_ to the
extent it is reasonably apparent on its face from a reading of the disclosure
that such disclosure is applicable to such other sections or subsections. The
disclosure of any matter or item in the Seller Disclosure Schedule will not be
deemed to constitute an acknowledgement that any such matter or item is
material or is required to be disclosed.

 



 

4.1. _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_.

 



 

(a) Seller is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its state of incorporation or organization and is
duly qualified, licensed or registered to do business as a foreign entity in
good standing in the jurisdictions where the operations of the Business
require it to be so qualified, except where the failure to be so qualified,
licensed or registered would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Seller has all requisite corporate power and authority to
conduct the Business as currently being conducted and to own, lease and
operate the Purchased Assets.

 



 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and all
Ancillary Documents, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
herein and therein will not and does not, with the passing of time, giving of
notice or both, violate or conflict with, constitute a breach of or default
under, result in a loss of any benefit under or permit the acceleration of any
obligation under or create in any party the right to terminate, modify or
cancel any term or provision of Sellers or Sellers Affiliates Governing
Documents.

 



 

4.2. _Authority; Approvals_.

 



 

(a) Seller has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to complete the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Seller and the Seller Board have taken all action required by Law,
Sellers Governing Documents and otherwise to authorize Sellers execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and each Ancillary Document to
which Seller is a party. Seller has duly and validly executed and delivered
this Agreement and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Buyer, this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of Seller enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar Laws

 



      
 

 



 

relating to creditors rights generally and to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law). Each Ancillary Document to which Seller is a party will, when
delivered by Seller at Closing and assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery of the same by Buyer, constitute the legal, valid and binding
obligation of Seller enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
Laws relating to creditors rights generally and to general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).

obtained or taken prior to the date hereof, is required by Law, Sellers
Governing Documents or otherwise in order to approve Sellers execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



 

(c) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document by Seller (and/or the applicable Seller Affiliate), nor the
completion or performance of the transactions by the Seller (or any applicable
Seller Affiliate) contemplated hereunder and thereunder or the performance of
the obligations of the Seller (and/or the applicable Seller Affiliate)
hereunder, will result in a Breach of any Contract to which any Seller (and/or
the applicable Seller Affiliate) is a party or to which it is bound, except
for such Breaches or violations, if any, which would not reasonably be
expected to preclude a Seller (and/or the applicable Seller Affiliate) from
consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document or to subject any Buyer to any liability with respect thereto.

 



 

4.3. _Absence of Breach_. Except as the same would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect, neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents by Seller, nor the completion or
performance by Seller of the transactions contemplated hereunder and
thereunder, will:

 



 

(a) assuming the Consents identified in _Schedule 4.4_ are obtained, Breach

the related unaudited pro forma statement of operations for the Business for
the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 (collectively, with the Latest
Interim Balance Sheet, the " _Latest Interim Financial Statements_ ") and the
unaudited pro forma statements of net assets of the Business as at December

assuming the Consents identified in _Schedule 4.4_ are obtained, neither the
consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement nor the

Licensed Intellectual Property will, to Sellers Knowledge, result in the
Breach of any license, contract or agreement to which Seller is a party except
for any such Breach that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. The Transferred Intellectual Property, together with Buyers
rights under the IP Use Transition Agreement and Shared IP License, is all of
the material Intellectual Property necessary to operate the Business as
presently conducted except for the Retained Intellectual Property described in
_Section 1.2(g)_.

 



 

(b) Seller (and/or the applicable Seller Affiliate) use of the Transferred

misappropriate or otherwise violate the Intellectual Property rights of any
Person, and no Person has given notice or alleged in writing (including
without limitation as part of any pending action, suit, hearing, claim, demand
or proceeding) that Sellers (or any Seller Affiliates) use of the
Transferred Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property subject to the

misappropriates or otherwise violates the Intellectual Property rights of any
Person. To Sellers Knowledge, except as set forth on _Schedule 4.15(b)_, no
Person has infringed, misappropriated or violated any of the Transferred
Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property subject to the Shared IP
License. To Sellers Knowledge, all registered Transferred Intellectual
Property and registered Intellectual Property subject to the Shared IP License
is valid and enforceable, and no Person has given notice or alleged in writing
to Seller (including without limitation as part of any pending action, suit,
hearing, claim, demand or proceeding) that any such Transferred Intellectual
Property or any such Intellectual Property subject to the Shared IP License is
not valid, is unenforceable or is owned in part or in full by any other
Person.

 



      
 

 



 

All necessary registration, maintenance and renewal fees currently due in
connection with any currently registered or applied for Transferred
Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property subject to the Shared IP
License, have been paid, and to Sellers Knowledge all currently due formal
legal requirements (including the timely post-registration applications)
relating to any Transferred Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property
subject to the Shared IP License currently registered or applied for have been
made, and all currently due documents, recordations and certificates in
connection with currently registered or applied for Transferred Intellectual
Property and Intellectual Property subject to the Shared IP License have been
filed with the relevant patent, trademark or other authorities in the U.S. or
foreign jurisdictions, as the case may be. Any registration, maintenance and
renewal fees and any responses to official actions or other legal requirements
relating to such Transferred Intellectual Property set forth in _Schedule
1.1(a)(iv)_ for which to Sellers Knowledge payment or action is due within
ninety (90) days following the Effective Time are set forth in _Schedule
4.15(b)_ (including the payment or action activity and due date). No
Transferred Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property subject to the

Transferred Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property subject to the
Shared IP License to enter into written agreements under which such Person
agrees to assign to Seller all of such Persons rights in any Intellectual
Property conceived, generated, made or reduced to practice by such Person in
connection with such Persons employment or engagement by Seller (and each
such Person has executed appropriate instruments of assignment in favor of
Seller if so requested), except where the failure to do so would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and (ii) Seller has
policies, which Seller uses its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce,
that require all Persons receiving Confidential Information of Seller or a
Third Party to whom Seller has an obligation of confidentiality that is within
the Transferred Intellectual Property to enter into written agreements under
which such Person agrees to maintain such Confidential Information of the
Seller (and the applicable Seller Affiliate) or Third Party.

 



 

(d) Seller has not granted any license or made any assignment of any of the
Transferred Intellectual Property, no Person jointly holds any ownership

(e) To Sellers Knowledge, there is no existing default or breach of any
obligation of Seller or any Third Party under any license to which the
Transferred Intellectual Property is subject (or event or condition that, with
notice or lapse of time or both could constitute a default or breach in any
material respect).

 



 

(f) To the extent necessary as a legal prerequisite for enforcing or avoiding
a loss of any rights in Transferred Intellectual Property, including loss of
available claims for statutory remedies and damages, Seller has used
commercially reasonable efforts to include appropriate statutory notices or
markings of registration in connection with its use of registered Marks,
proper marking practices in connection with the use of Patents, and

contemplated hereby and thereby, except (a) the Consents and filings set forth
in _Schedule 5.4_ or (b) where the failure to give such notice, make such

Buyer from consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
Ancillary Document, preclude Parent from fulfilling its obligations hereunder,
or subject Seller to any liability with respect thereto.

 



 

5.5. _Litigation_. There is no suit, action, arbitration, administrative or
other proceeding, or governmental investigation, pending or, to Buyers
Knowledge, threatened in writing against any Buyer or Parent which would

pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as

so as to enable the parties to expeditiously close the transactions
contemplated hereby no later than the Termination Date. In

 



      
 

 



 

addition, Seller and US Buyer shall each use its commercially reasonable
efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court
by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any
decree, order or judgment that would prevent the Closing by the Termination
Date. **** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary with respect to any
actions, non-actions, clearances, waivers, consents, approvals or permits from
any Authority or under any Antitrust Law that are required to be obtained in
connection with this Agreement, US Buyer, Seller, and their Affiliates shall
not be required to, and Seller shall not, without the prior written consent of

foregoing actions) or (iii) agree to any changes or restrictions on, or other
impairment of, the ability of US Buyer, Seller, or any of their respective

businesses (including the Business) or interests therein.

Act filing.

 



 

6.5. _Employees_.

 



 

(a) The applicable Buyer shall offer employment effective as of the Effective
Time to each Business Employee listed on _Schedule 6.5(a)_ and who is
employed by Seller immediately prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall
promptly notify US Buyer in writing of any termination, resignation or other
change in status of the Business Employees prior to the Closing Date,
including which of such employees (if any) are on short-term or long-term
disability leave or other authorized leaves of absence. A Business Employee
who is absent immediately prior to the Closing Date due to vacation, holiday,
authorized leave of absence, illness or injury (other than short-term or long-
term disability) shall be considered to be employed immediately prior to the
Closing Date provided US Buyer is notified of the anticipated return to active
duty prior to the Closing Date. The applicable Buyer shall offer employment to
any Business Employee listed on _Schedule 6.5(a)_ and who is absent
immediately prior to the Closing Date due to short-term disability effective
as of the date that such employee is able to return to active employment with
such Buyer; provided that such date is within three months after the Closing
Date. The applicable Buyer shall offer to hire and employ each Business
Employee listed on _Schedule 6.5(a)_ in a position with similar requirements
and responsibilities and with base compensation and bonus that are, on the
whole, equivalent to each such Business Employees current aggregate base and
bonus and with benefits that are provided by such Buyer to similarly situated
employees of such Buyer.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) After the Closing Date, each Business Employee who is employed by Seller
immediately prior to the Closing Date and who accepts employment with the
applicable Buyer, which acceptance will include authorization to transfer to
the applicable Buyer the employee data described in _Section 1.2(l)_ ("
_Transferred Employees_ ") shall be entitled to participate in the applicable
Buyers benefit plans on the same basis as is currently offered to similarly
situated employees of such Buyer. For purposes of eligibility and vesting
under any such plan, service by a Transferred Employee with Seller prior to
the Closing Date shall be taken into account to the extent such service was
recognized by Seller and set forth in _Schedule 4.13_ as if such service had
been performed for the applicable Buyer and shall be added to the service
rendered by such employee to such Buyer after the Closing Date. In
determining the amount of vacation and severance pay accruable by any
Transferred Employee after the Closing Date under the terms of the vacation
and severance pay plans of such Buyer, credit shall be given for such
employees service with Seller on or prior to the Closing Date as set forth in
_Schedule 4.13_. Following the Closing, Seller will pay to each Transferred
Employee the dollar value of the accrued and unused vacation time attributable
to such Transferred Employee and such accrued vacation will not be an Assumed
Liability.

 



 

(c) Seller will (i) cooperate with Buyers in all respects with respect to, and
not discourage any Business Employee from accepting, the applicable Buyers
offer of employment to the Transferred Employees, which will be made on or
prior to the Closing Date; (ii) not counter offer to retain any of the
Transferred Employees; (iii) to the extent practicable, assign to the
applicable Buyer each Transferred Employees assignment of inventions and/or
restrictive covenants agreement to the extent related to the Business; and
(iv) on or prior to the Closing Date pay to each Transferred Employee the pro
rata portion of any bonus that, if determined on an annualized basis in
accordance with Sellers bonus plan on the Closing Date, would be due and
payable.

 



 

(d) Each applicable Buyer will be responsible for the administration and the
financial obligation of all workers compensation claims with respect to
Transferred Employees arising out of or relating to occurrences on or after
the Effective Time and Seller shall be responsible for the administration and
the financial obligation of any workers compensation claims with respect to
Transferred Employees arising out of or relating to occurrences before the
Effective Time. In the event that a Transferred Employee notifies US Buyer
after the Effective Time of a workers compensation injury that is the result
of an aggravation of an injury that occurred while working for Seller prior to
the Effective Time, the responsibility for the administration and financial
obligation of this claim ( _i.e._ , the allocation between Sellers workers
compensation coverage and US Buyers workers compensation coverage) will be
determined by the state law applicable to such claim and shall be subject to
the final interpretation of the appropriate state court or administrative
agency, as the case may be.

 



 

(e) Each applicable Buyer will be responsible only for those employees who are
Transferred Employees and, subject to complying with its obligations set forth
in _Section 6.5(a)_, shall have the full discretion to determine the terms
and conditions of employment and location for the Transferred Employees.
Seller shall be solely responsible for any obligations of Seller to provide
retirement payments, retiree life

 



      
 

 



 

insurance, retiree medical, and retiree dental benefits to Business Employees
who are entitled to such benefits prior to the Closing and who were covered
under retiree welfare programs of such Seller as of the Closing, and to their
covered dependents.

 



 

(f) Seller and US Buyer agree to utilize, or cause their respective Affiliates
to utilize, the standard procedure set forth in Rev. Proc. 2004-53 with
respect to Form W-2 wage reporting. US Buyer intends to qualify as a
"successor employer" as defined under Internal Revenue Code Section 3121(a)(1)
thereby allowing US Buyer to utilize the wages paid by Seller to determine the
taxable wages of the Transferred Employees for FICA and FUTA tax reporting
purposes.

 



 

6.6. _Patent Claims_. Buyers agree that they will not initiate any
infringement claim as to any patent, registered trademark or registered trade
name included in the Purchased Assets against any Third Party with respect to
those acts of alleged infringement of such Third Party that occurred prior to
the Effective Time without the prior consent of the Seller, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Nothing herein shall restrict Buyers
rights to bring any claims against any Third Party acts occurring on or after
the Effective Time.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 7 
OTHER COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS**

 



 

7.1. _Public Announcement_. Except as otherwise agreed in writing between US
Buyer and Seller or as required by Law, neither of US Buyer nor Seller, nor

acquired, Seller shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to divest that

attorney or other materials necessary or helpful for the preparation and
filing of all Tax Returns and any other returns, reports and forms relating to
Taxes, the conduct of audit examinations, the resolving of or the defense of
any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to Taxes. Each Buyer and
each Seller recognizes that the others may need access, from time to time,
after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and Tax records and information
held by it, to the extent such records and information pertain to events
occurring prior to the Closing Date; therefor, each Buyer and each Seller
agrees, (a) to properly retain and maintain such records and (b) to allow each
of the other parties hereto and its respective

 



      
 

 



 

agents, auditors and representatives, at times and dates mutually acceptable
to the parties hereto, to inspect, review and make copies of such records as
such party or its agents, auditors or representatives may deem necessary or
appropriate from time to time, such activities to be conducted during normal
business hours and at the expense of the requesting party.

 



 

7.5. _Retention of and Access to Records_. From and after the Closing Date and
subject to the provisions of _Section 6.2(c)_. US Buyer will retain for a
period consistent with US Buyers record-retention policies and practices and
no less than as may be required by any applicable Law the Business
Information. US Buyer will provide Seller and its representatives with
reasonable access to and copies of all such books and records, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable written notice, as necessary to enable
Seller to prepare Tax Returns or respond to Tax audits.

 



 

7.6. _Further Assurances_. Seller and US Buyer agree that, from time to time,
from and after the Closing Date, each of them will execute and deliver, and
will cause to be executed and delivered, such further instruments of
conveyance and transfer and take such other action as may be reasonably
necessary to carry out the purposes and intents of this Agreement.

 



 

7.7. _Insurance Proceeds_. In the event that after the date hereof and prior
to the Closing, there occurs an event or circumstance arising out of the
operation of the Business or the ownership of the Purchased Assets that gives
Seller a cause of action or claim against a third party (including any claim
under an applicable insurance policy and claims under any warranties,
representations and guarantees made by suppliers, manufacturers, contractors
and other third parties) and such event or circumstance is identified with
reasonable specificity in writing by Buyer to Seller within twelve months of
the Closing Date, then Seller will either (i) to the extent transferrable,
assign any right it has to pursue such claim to US Buyer or (ii) use its
commercially reasonable efforts, at the request and at the expense of Seller,
to pursue such cause of action against such third party or file such insurance
claim and upon receipt of any proceeds by Seller from such cause of action or
insurance or claim, Seller will remit the same to US Buyer less any expenses
incurred by Seller in pursuing such action or claim that were not previously
reimbursed by US Buyer and less any increase in premiums that Seller
reasonably believes will result from such claim.

 



 

7.8. _Historical Audited Financial Statements_. As promptly as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, Seller (i) shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to prepare financial statements of the Business at the
dates and for the periods necessary to permit US Buyer to satisfy its
obligations, pursuant to Section 3-05 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, to file historical financial statements of
the Business with its periodic reports pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended; (ii) shall cause PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to audit such
financial statements and to deliver its audit opinion with respect thereto;
and (iii) shall cause PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to perform a SAS 100
quarterly review of such interim financial statements with respect thereto,
provided that the cost and expense of Deloitte LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP incurred by Seller in connection with clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) will be
paid by the US Buyer. Furthermore, Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP a consent, in customary form
reasonably acceptable to US Buyer, to the inclusion of the historical audited

 



      
 

 



 

financial statements of the Business in periodic reports filed by US Buyer
pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing herein shall require Seller to pay any consideration
(except for any amount that Buyers agree in writing to reimburse Seller) or
agree to relinquish or modify any rights in exchange for obtaining any such
consent. Seller shall have no liability for, and shall not be responsible for
any Losses incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party arising out of, any failure
of US Buyer to be able to meet its filing obligations under the Securities and
Exchange Commission as a result of any failure to have the financials
contemplated in this _Section 7.8_ to be timely prepared unless there is a
Willful Breach by Seller of its obligations under this _Section 7.8_.

applicable provisions of _Section 10.4_, Buyer will indemnify in full, Seller
and Sellers Affiliates and the officers, directors, employees and agents of

them harmless from and against, any and all Losses which they or any of them
may suffer or incur, directly, regardless of when suffered or incurred and
whether or not involving a claim by a Third Party, which arise or result from:

 



 

(a) any breach, or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty by Buyer in
this Agreement, which for purposes of determining the amount of Loss only
shall be determined in each case without giving effect to any materiality or
Material Adverse Effect qualifiers therein; provided, however, that a
representation or warranty that contains any materiality or Material Adverse
Effect qualifier shall be deemed to have been given with such qualification
for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach or inaccuracy with
respect to such representation or warranty;

 



 

(b) any breach of, or failure to perform, any covenant, agreement or
undertaking of Buyer in this Agreement;

 



 

(c) the Assumed Liabilities; or

and expenses, in connection with enforcing the indemnification rights of the

applicable provisions of _Section 10.4_, Seller will indemnify in full Buyer
and Buyers Affiliates and the officers, directors, employees and agents of

them may suffer or incur, directly, regardless of when suffered or incurred
and whether or not involving a claim by a Third Party, which arise or result
from:

 



 

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty by Seller in
this Agreement, which for purposes of determining the amount of Loss only
shall be determined in each case without giving effect to any materiality or
Material Adverse Effect qualifiers therein; provided, however, that a
representation or warranty that contains any materiality or Material Adverse
Effect qualifier shall be deemed to have been given with such qualification

covenant, agreement or undertaking of Seller in this Agreement;

 



 

(c) the Retained Liabilities; or

expenses, incurred in connection with enforcing the indemnification rights of
the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to this _Section 10.3_, in each case
to the extent that such enforcement is successful.

 



 

10.4. _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) After the Closing, (i) the Buyer Indemnified Parties may not recover any
Losses under _Section 10.3(a)_ until the total of all Losses with respect to
those matters collectively exceed $720,000 (the " _Basket_ "), in which case,
subject to any other applicable limitations contained in this _Section 10.4_,
the Buyer Indemnified Parties will be entitled to recover only those Losses in
excess of the Basket; and (ii) the Buyer Indemnified Parties may not recover
any Losses under _Section 10.3(a)_ to the extent that all Losses with respect
to those matters collectively exceed $12,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Basket nor the Cap will apply with
respect to any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties
contained in _Section 4.1_ (Organization, Standing and Corporate Power),
_Section 4.2_ (Authority; Approvals); _Section 4.12_ (Tax Matters); (the "
_Fundamental Representations_ ") or to any claims based on fraud or Willful
Breach, and the Losses associated with any such breaches, misstatements, or
inaccuracies will not count toward the Basket or Cap for determining the
recoverability of other Losses; provided that, in no event will the liability
of Seller under this Agreement in the aggregate exceed the Cash Consideration
(as adjusted pursuant _Section 2.3_). In addition, any Losses recoverable
under _Section 10.3(a)_ that arise or result from any breach or inaccuracy of
the representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.21_ (Sufficiency
of Assets) will not be subject to the Basket (or count toward the Basket for
determining the recoverability of other Losses) and the Buyer Indemnified
Parties may not recover any such Losses to the extent they exceed $25,000,000.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall, as soon as practicable following the making of any claim for
indemnification hereunder, file a claim with any applicable third-party
insurer to seek to

 



      
 

 



 

recover any insurance proceeds available with respect to any such Loss;
provided that nothing in this _Section 10.4(b)_ (except for the last sentence
of this _Section 10.4(b)_) will limit Buyers ability to bring any indemnity
claim hereunder. Losses recoverable by a Buyer Indemnified Party will be (i)
reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds actually received by Buyer
with respect to those Losses less the costs to recover such proceeds; and (ii)
increased by the portion of any premium increase in the next policy period of
the applicable insurance policy and any retroactive premium adjustment or
replacement insurance policy that results directly from the assertion of such
claim, as determined by correspondence from the insurance carrier or insurance
broker to Buyer, a copy which shall have been provided to Seller. If any such
amounts are received by a Buyer Indemnified Party within twenty-four months
after being fully indemnified by Seller for the relevant Losses hereunder,
such amounts will be paid to Seller. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, no party shall be entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under
any provision of this Agreement for any amount to the extent such party or its
Affiliate has been indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any other
provision of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Upon making an indemnity payment pursuant to this Agreement, the
Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such payment, be subrogated to all
rights of the Indemnified Party against any third party (other than any
customer, vendor, employee, agent or representative of the Indemnified Party)
in respect of the Losses to which the payment related. Without limiting the
generality of any other provision hereof, each such Indemnified Party and
Indemnifying Party will duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably
necessary to evidence and perfect the above described subrogation rights.

 



 

(d) Neither Buyer nor Seller shall have any liability or obligation under this
_ARTICLE 10_ with respect to claims made pursuant to _Sections 10.2_ or
_10.3_ unless such party shall have received notice of such claim (describing
the claim in reasonable detail, a reasonable estimate of the amount thereof
(or if the notifying party is unable to determine the amount thereof, a
statement to such effect), and the basis thereof) within the applicable
survival period set forth in _Section 10.1_.

 



 

(e) Seller shall have no liability or obligation to any Buyer Indemnified
Party for any Loss to the extent, but only to the extent, the Liability
attributable to such Loss is specifically and identifiably accrued in the
calculation of the Closing Modified Net Working Capital as finally determined
pursuant to _Section 2.3_ (and such Loss shall not be included as a Loss for
purposes of the Basket or the Cap).

 



 

10.5. _Indemnification Claims Procedures_.

 



 

(a) If a Buyer Indemnified Party becomes aware of a claim for indemnification
under _Section 10.3_, it will promptly notify Seller of the claim, and if a
Seller Indemnified Party becomes aware of a claim for indemnification under
_Section 10.2_, it will promptly notify Buyer of the claim (in each case, the
giver of such notification being referred to hereafter as the " _Indemnified
Party_ ," and the recipient of such notification being referred to hereafter
as the " _Indemnifying Party_ "). Such

 



      
 

 



 

indemnification notice will specify in reasonable detail, to the extent then
known, the nature and amount of the Losses suffered and the facts giving rise
to the claim.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party will have 30 days after receipt of the
indemnification notice to notify the Indemnified Party in writing of any
objections thereto, specifying in reasonable detail the nature of and basis
for each objection. To the extent that the Indemnifying Party fails to timely
object to all or part of an indemnification claim, the Indemnifying Party will
be deemed to have irrevocably accepted liability for the claim. To the extent
that the Indemnifying Party timely objects to all or part of an
indemnification claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will
negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute within 30 days thereafter. If
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party are unable to resolve the
dispute within that 30 day period, then either of them may proceed to litigate
the dispute subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

10.6. _Third Party Proceedings_.

 



 

(a) The Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Third Party Claim and may elect to assume the defense of the Third Party
Claim by delivering written notice of the election within ten (10) Business
Days after receiving notice of the Third Party Claim as provided in _Section
10.5_ provided that:

 



 

(i) Indemnifying Party irrevocably confirms, based on all of the facts known
to the Indemnifying Party, its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party
with respect to such third-party claim pursuant to, and on the terms and
subject to the limitations set forth in, this _ARTICLE 10_;

 



 

(ii) the applicable Third Party Claim (A) seeks and can only result in money
damages; and

 



 

(iii) Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the applicable Third Party
Claim actively and diligently.

 



 

(b) If an Indemnifying Party timely elects to assume the defense of a Third
Party Claim:

 



 

(i) the Indemnifying Party will not, so long as it conducts the defense, be
liable to the Indemnified Party under this _ARTICLE 10_ for any fees of other
counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of the Third Party
Claim, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense of the Third Party Claim after notice of
assumption of defense of the same by the Indemnifying Party; except to the
extent that conflicts of interest or the rules of professional conduct prevent
the counsel for the Indemnifying Party from adequately representing the
Indemnified Party or necessitates that the Indemnified Party obtain separate
counsel, in which case the cost of such counsel for the Indemnified Party will
be included as a Loss; and

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) no compromise or settlement of the Third Party Claim may be effected by
the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Partys Consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) unless the compromise
or settlement includes a grant by each claimant or plaintiff of a full,
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all Liabilities arising
from or relating to the claim and the sole relief provided for is monetary
damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party (or its Affiliates).

 



 

(c) If an Indemnifying Party does not timely elect to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party will be bound by any
determination made in the Proceeding or any compromise or settlement effected
by the Indemnified Party except that the Indemnified Person shall not admit
any Liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third
Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys Consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 



 

(d) The Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, that
is controlling the defense of a Third Party Claim will keep the other
reasonably informed of the Proceeding at all stages thereof, whether or not
the other is represented by counsel. Each party agrees to render to each other
such assistance as may reasonably be requested in order to ensure the proper
and adequate defense of a Third Party Claim. Each party will cooperate with
the other and provide such assistance, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, as such other party may reasonably request in connection
with the defense of the Third Party Claim, including providing such other
party with reasonable access to and reasonable use of all relevant corporate
records and making its officers and employees reasonably available for
depositions, pretrial discovery and as witnesses at trial, if required. In
requesting any such cooperation, the party requesting such assistance will
have due regard for, and attempt to not be disruptive of, the business and day
to day operations of the other party and will follow all reasonable requests
of the other party regarding any documents or instruments which such party
believes should be given confidential treatment.

 



 

10.7. _Tax Treatment_. For Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law, the
parties agree to treat all payments made under this _ARTICLE 10_, and any
payments in respect of any Breaches of representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements hereunder, as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

 



 

10.8. _Exclusive Remedy_. After the Closing, except for claims of fraud or
Willful Breach, the rights and remedies set forth in this _ARTICLE 10_ are
the sole and exclusive rights and remedies of any Indemnified Party (including
Buyer and Seller) under or in connection with this Agreement, except that
nothing will limit any right to injunctive relief as provided in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document or under applicable Law.

schedules hereto, embodies the entire agreement and understanding of the
parties in respect of the subject matter contained herein and supersedes all
prior agreements and the understandings between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement, other than, prior to the Effective Time,

or comments in connection with, the transactions contemplated herein will
