such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason
of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish

applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this <U>Section&nbsp;3.2</U>, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive

the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the payment of such consideration under the
Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts

form so delivered, is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
MDCP Parties, Parent and Sub and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto. Other than
as permitted pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;7.12(a)</U>, none of the Equity Funding Letters or the
Commitment Letter has been materially amended or modified, no such material amendment or
modification is contemplated, and the respective commitments contained in such letters have not
been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated in any respect, and neither Parent nor Sub is in breach of
any of the material terms or conditions set forth therein and no event has occurred which, with or

Letter that are due as of the date hereof and will pay, after the date hereof, all such commitments

precedent or other similar contractual contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing, other than as set forth in or contemplated by the Equity Funding Letters or the
Commitment Letter. The aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Equity Funding Letters and the

will not be available to Sub on the Closing Date. There are no side letters or other agreements or
arrangements relating to the Financing to which Parent, Sub or any of their Affiliates is a party.

extension of the time of payment or performance of, renewal or alteration of, any Guaranteed
Obligation, any escrow arrangement or other security therefor, any liability incurred

ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION<BR>
OF<BR>
CDW CORPORATION
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FIRST: The name of the Corporation is CDW Corporation (hereinafter the &#147;Corporation&#148;).

the powers of the Corporation and of its directors and shareholders:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The number of directors of the Corporation shall be such as from time to time shall
be fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the by-laws. Election of directors need not be
by ballot unless the by-laws so provide.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The board of directors shall have power, without the assent or vote of the
shareholders, to make, alter, amend, change, add to or repeal the by-laws of the
Corporation; to fix and vary the amount to be reserved for any proper purpose; to authorize
and cause to be executed mortgages and liens upon all or any part of the property of the
Corporation; to determine the use and disposition of any surplus or net profits; and to fix

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The directors, in their discretion, may submit any contract or act for approval or
ratification at any annual meeting of the shareholders for the purpose of considering any
such act or contract, and any contract or act that shall be approved or be ratified by the

which is represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote thereat
(provided that a lawful quorum of shareholders be there represented in person or by proxy)
shall be as valid and as binding upon the Corporation and upon all the shareholders as
though it had been approved or ratified by every shareholder of the

because of any director&#146;s interest, or for any other reason.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In addition to the powers and authorities herein before or by statute expressly
conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do
all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation; subject,
nevertheless, to the provisions of the statutes of Illinois, of these Articles, and to any
by-laws from time to time made by the shareholders; provided, however, that no by-laws so
made shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which would have been valid if such
by-law had not been made.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIXTH: The Corporation shall, to the full extent permitted by Section&nbsp;8.75 of the Illinois
Business Corporation Act, as amended from time to time, indemnify all persons whom it may indemnify
pursuant thereto.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SEVENTH: To the fullest extent permitted by the IBCA, no director of the Corporation shall be
personally liable to the Corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages, for breach of his
fiduciary duty as a director; provided, that nothing herein shall be construed to eliminate or
limit the liability of a director (a)&nbsp;for any breach of the director&#146;s duty of loyalty to the
Corporation or its shareholders, (b)&nbsp;for acts or omissions not in good faith or involving
intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, (c)&nbsp;under Section&nbsp;8.65 of the Illinois Business
Corporation Act, as amended, or (d)&nbsp;for any transaction from which the director derived an improper
personal benefit.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Nature of Indemnity. Each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made
a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (hereinafter a &#147;proceeding&#148;), by reason of the fact that he
or she (or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative), is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee, fiduciary, or agent of another corporation or of a partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit
plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is an alleged action in an official capacity as
a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent or in any other capacity while serving as
a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by
the Corporation to the fullest extent which it is empowered to do so by the IBCA, as the
same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the
extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights
than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment) against all
cost, expense, liability and loss (including attorneys&#146; fees actually and reasonably
incurred by such person in connection with such proceeding) and such indemnification shall
inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however,
that, except as provided in paragraph (2)&nbsp;of this <U>Article&nbsp;Seventh</U>, the Corporation
shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding
initiated by such person only if such proceeding was authorized by the board of directors of
the Corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this <U>Article&nbsp;Seventh</U>
shall be a contract right and, subject to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">paragraphs (2)&nbsp;and (4)&nbsp;of this <U>Article&nbsp;Seventh</U>, shall include the right to
payment by the Corporation of the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in
advance of its final disposition. The Corporation may, by action of the board of directors,
provide indemnification to employees and agents of the Corporation with the same scope and
effect and exclusions as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Procedure for Indemnification of Directors and Officers. Any indemnification of a
director or officer of the Corporation under paragraph (1)&nbsp;of this <U>Article&nbsp;Seventh</U>
or advance of expenses under paragraph (4)&nbsp;of this <U>Article&nbsp;Seventh</U> shall be made
promptly, and in any event within 30&nbsp;days, upon the written request of the director or
officer. If a determination by the Corporation that the director or officer is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this <U>Article&nbsp;Seventh</U> is required, and the Corporation
fails to respond within 60&nbsp;days to a written request for indemnity, the Corporation shall be
deemed to have approved the request. If the Corporation denies a written request for
indemnification or advancing of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full
pursuant to such request is not made within 30&nbsp;days, the right to indemnification or
advances as granted by this <U>Article&nbsp;Seventh</U> shall be enforceable by the director or
officer in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such person&#146;s costs and expenses incurred
in connection with successfully establishing his or her right to indemnification, in whole
or in part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a
defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses
incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required
undertaking, if any, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the
standards of conduct which make it permissible under the IBCA for the Corporation to
indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of such defense shall be on
the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including the board of directors,
independent legal counsel, or its shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the
circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the
IBCA, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its board of directors,
independent legal counsel, or its shareholders) that the claimant has not met such
applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption
that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on its own behalf
and on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary, or agent
of the Corporation or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in
any such capacity, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such
person against such liability under this <U>Article&nbsp;Seventh</U>.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Expenses. Expenses incurred by any person described in paragraph (1)&nbsp;of this
<U>Article&nbsp;Seventh</U> in defending a proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in
advance of such proceeding&#146;s final disposition unless otherwise determined by the board

director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she
is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. Such expenses incurred by other
employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the board of
directors deems appropriate.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)
Employees and Agents. Persons who are not covered by the foregoing provisions of this <U>Article&nbsp;Seventh</U> and who are or were employees or agents of the Corporation, or
who are or were serving at the request of the Corporation as employees or agents of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, may be indemnified to
the extent authorized at any time or from time to time by the board of directors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;Contract Rights. The provisions of this <U>Article&nbsp;Seventh</U> shall be deemed to
be a contract right between the Corporation and each director or officer who serves in any
such capacity at any time while this <U>Article&nbsp;Seventh</U> and the relevant provisions of
the IBCA or other applicable law are in effect, and any repeal or modification of this
<U>Article&nbsp;Seventh</U> or any such law shall not affect any rights or obligations then
existing with respect to any state of facts or proceeding then existing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;Merger or Consolidation. For purposes of this <U>Article&nbsp;Seventh</U>, references
to &#147;the Corporation&#148; shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any
constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a
consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power
and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any
person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation,
or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this <U>Article&nbsp;Seventh</U> with respect
to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would have with respect to such
constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;Repeal or Modification. Any repeal or modification of this <U>Article&nbsp;Seventh</U>
shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing
at the time of such repeal or modification.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)&nbsp;Non-exclusivity of <U>Article&nbsp;Seventh</U>. The rights to indemnification and the
payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition
conferred in this <U>Article&nbsp;Seventh</U> shall not be exclusive of any other right which
any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the articles of
incorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EIGHTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision
contained in these Articles of Incorporation in the manner now or hereafter prescribed
