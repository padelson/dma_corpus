AGREEMENT   THIS PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "AGREEMENT") is made and
entered into as of this 11th day of April, 2003, by and among WILLIAMS GAS
PIPELINE COMPANY, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("SELLER"), THE
WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC., a Delaware corporation ("PARENT") (solely with
respect to its obligations under Section 4.10 hereof), and LOEWS PIPELINE
HOLDING CORP., a Delaware corporation ("BUYER").   W I T N E S S E T H:  
WHEREAS, Seller owns 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock (the
"SHARES") of Texas Gas Transmission Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
"COMPANY"); and   WHEREAS, Parent owns 100% of the issued and
outstanding limited liability company interests of Seller; and   WHEREAS,
Buyer desires to purchase the Shares from Seller, and Seller desires to sell
the Shares to Buyer, in each case upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration
of the mutual terms, conditions and other agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE I.  SALE AND
PURCHASE   SECTION 1.1. AGREEMENT TO SELL AND TO PURCHASE; CLOSING.   (a)
On the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), and upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Seller shall sell, assign,
transfer, convey and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and accept
from Seller, all of the Shares, free and clear of any pledges, restrictions
on transfer, proxies and voting or other agreements, liens, claims, charges,
mortgages, security interests or other legal or equitable
encumbrances, limitations or restrictions of any nature whatsoever other than
as may be set forth in the Organizational Documents (as defined in Section
2.2) of the Company ("ENCUMBRANCES").   (b) The closing of such sale and
purchase (the "CLOSING") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. (Houston, Texas time)
at the offices of Andrews and Kurth LLP in Houston, Texas (or at such other
location as the parties hereto shall agree in writing) no later than five (5)
business days after the satisfaction of the conditions to Closing contained
in Articles V and VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be fulfilled at Closing), or at such other time and date as the parties
hereto shall agree in writing (the "CLOSING DATE"). At the Closing, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer the stock certificates representing the Shares duly
endorsed in blank, or accompanied by stock powers duly executed in blank in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller (the "STOCK
TRANSFER"). In full consideration and exchange for the Shares, Buyer shall
thereupon pay to Seller the Purchase Price as provided in Section 1.2 at the
times and in the manner described in Sections 1.2 and 1.3. Notwithstanding
that the Purchase Price shall be    subject to subsequent adjustment
pursuant to Section 1.3, the delivery of the Estimated Purchase Price to
Seller under Section 1.2(b) shall result in the full and final sale of the
Shares.   SECTION 1.2. PURCHASE PRICE; PAYMENT OF ESTIMATED PURCHASE PRICE
AT CLOSING.   (a) The purchase price for the Shares (the "PURCHASE PRICE")
shall be $795,000,000.00 as such amount is adjusted in accordance with
Section 1.3. In addition, Buyer acknowledges that the Company has outstanding
Funded Debt in the principal amount of $250,000,000.00 (as of December 31,
2002), as further described on Schedule 1.2, plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon.   (b) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller
$795,000,000.00 as adjusted pursuant to subsection (c) below (the "ESTIMATED
PURCHASE PRICE"). Payment to Seller shall be paid by wire transfer to Seller
of immediately available funds made to a bank account in the United States of
America designated in writing by Seller not less than three (3) business days
before the Closing Date.   (c) At the Closing, Seller shall deliver to
Buyer a certificate setting forth its best estimate of the Working Capital as
of the Closing Date based on the same procedures described in Section 1.3 for
determining the Working Capital (the "ESTIMATED WORKING CAPITAL"). If
Estimated Working Capital exceeds Working Capital on the Base Statement, then
the amount to be paid to Seller at Closing under subsection (b) above shall
be increased by the amount of such excess. If Working Capital on the Base
Statement exceeds Estimated Working Capital, then the amount to be paid to
Seller under subsection (b) above shall be decreased by the amount of such
excess.   SECTION 1.3. ADJUSTMENT TO PURCHASE PRICE.   (a) Schedule 1.3
sets forth the Working Capital of the Company as of December 31, 2002 (the
"BASE STATEMENT") based on the Financial Statements and as such is determined
in accordance with this Agreement. "WORKING CAPITAL" shall mean Current
Assets less Current Liabilities. "CURRENT ASSETS" shall mean current assets
of the Company as reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the
Company as of the relevant date of determination. "CURRENT LIABILITIES" shall
mean the current liabilities of the Company as reflected in the consolidated
financial statements of the Company as of the relevant date of determination.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of calculating Working Capital,
none of the following shall be included in Current Assets or Current
Liabilities: (i) the current assets and current liabilities, if any, of the
Retained Entities; (ii) assets or liabilities of the Company related
to deferred Taxes or the payment of Taxes (including Taxes for which Seller
is liable under Section 4.10); (iii) the current portion of any principal
payment obligation of Funded Debt; (iv) assets related to prepaid insurance;
(v) intercompany receivables or intercompany payables (that is, receivables
from or payables to Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Company)); (vi) any current assets or current liabilities related to the
matters being retained by the Seller under Section 8.2(a)(iv), Section
8.2(a)(v), and Section 8.2(a)(vi); (vii) transportation and exchange gas
receivables and payables, storage gas receivables and payables, costs
recoverable from customers and gas stored underground; (viii) any reversal of
current liability reserves or reversals of current assets reserves, including
contra-assets accounts for current assets (including   2    allowances
for doubtful accounts); (ix) any current liabilities relating to checks that
have been issued but have not yet cleared the bank accounts; (x) any changes
to current assets and current liabilities resulting from a reclassification
of any assets and liabilities included in the Financial Statements; or (xi)
any changes to current assets or current liabilities resulting from the
accrual of liability in respect of FAS 112 long term disability to the extent
relating to the salary component. Within 60 days following the Closing Date,
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the "CLOSING
STATEMENT"), which shall set forth in reasonable detail (A) the amount of
Working Capital of the Company as of the Closing Date based upon a detailed
balance sheet prepared as of the Closing Date on a basis consistent with the
balance sheet included in the Base Statement; (B) a copy of such Closing Date
balance sheet and (C) a calculation of the adjustment to the Purchase Price
that is payable based upon the difference between the Estimated Working
Capital (as defined in Section 1.2(c)) and the Working Capital in the Closing
Statement. Seller agrees, at no cost to Buyer, to give Buyer and
its authorized representatives reasonable access (provided that in their
sole discretion Seller or its representatives may accompany Buyer and
its representatives) to such employees, officers and other facilities and
such books and records of Seller as are reasonably necessary to allow Buyer
and its authorized representatives to prepare the Closing Statement. The Base
Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP (as defined in Section
2.7) and on a basis consistent with the Financial Statements using the same
accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures and adjustments as were
used in the preparation of the Financial Statements (except as set forth in
this Section 1.3 and in Schedule 1.3). The Closing Statement shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP and on a basis consistent with the Financial
Statements, using the same accounting methods, policies, practices,
procedures and adjustments as were used in the preparation of the Base
Statement, except that Current Liabilities in the Closing Statement shall
include as a liability the amount, if any, by which the accrual of liability
(whether current or long term) in respect of FAS 112 long term disability to
the extent relating to the salary component exceeds $2,500,000.00.   (b)
Following its receipt from Buyer of the Closing Statement, Seller shall have
30 days to review the Closing Statement and to inform Buyer in writing of any
disagreement which it may have with the Closing Statement, which objection
(i) shall specify in reasonable detail Seller\'s disagreement with
the Closing Statement and (ii) shall include a detailed adjusted balance
sheet prepared as of the Closing Date reflecting the adjustments and changes
requested by Seller (the "OBJECTION"). Buyer agrees, at no cost to Seller, to
give Seller and its authorized representatives reasonable access to such
employees, officers and other facilities and such books and records of the
Company as are reasonably necessary to allow Seller and its authorized
representatives to review and confirm the Closing Statement prepared by
Buyer. If Buyer does not receive the Objection within such 30-day period, the
amount of Working Capital set forth on the Closing Statement delivered
pursuant to Section 1.3(a) shall be deemed to have been accepted by Seller
and shall become binding upon Seller. If Seller does timely deliver an
Objection to Buyer, Buyer shall then have 10 days from the date of receipt of
such Objection (the "REVIEW PERIOD") to review and respond to the Objection.
Buyer and Seller shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements
with respect to the determination of Working Capital of the Company as of the
Closing Date or the amount of the adjustment to the Purchase Price. If they
are unable to resolve all of their disagreements with respect to the
determination of Working Capital of the Company as of the Closing Date or the
amount of the adjustment to the Purchase Price within 10 days following the
expiration of Buyer\'s Review Period, they may refer, at the  
3    option of either Buyer or Seller, their differences to
PriceWaterhouseCoopers, L.L.C., or if PriceWaterhouseCoopers, L.L.C. declines
to accept such engagement, a nationally recognized firm of independent public
accountants selected jointly by Buyer and Seller, who shall determine only
with respect to the differences so submitted, whether and to what extent, if
any, the amount of Working Capital of the Company as of the Closing Date set
forth in the Closing Statement requires adjustment. If Buyer and Seller are
unable to so select the independent public accountants within five days of
PriceWaterhouseCoopers, L.L.C. declining to accept such engagement, either
Buyer or Seller may thereafter request that the CPR Institute for Dispute
Resolution make such selection (as applicable, PriceWaterhouseCoopers,
L.L.C., the firm selected by Buyer and Seller or the firm selected by the CPR
Institute for Dispute Resolution is referred to as the "CPA FIRM"). Buyer and
Seller shall direct the CPA Firm to use its reasonable best efforts to render
its determination within 30 days after the issue is first submitted to the
CPA Firm. The CPA Firm\'s determination shall be conclusive and binding upon
Buyer and Seller. The fees and disbursements of the CPA Firm shall be shared
equally by Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller shall make readily available to
the CPA Firm all relevant books and records relating to the Closing Statement
and all other items reasonably requested by the CPA Firm. The
Closing Statement as agreed to by Buyer and Seller or as determined by the
CPA Firm shall be referred to as the "FINAL CLOSING STATEMENT."   (c) If
Working Capital on the Final Closing Statement exceeds Estimated Working
Capital, then Buyer shall pay to Seller in cash the amount of such excess. If
Estimated Working Capital exceeds Working Capital on the Final Closing
Statement, then Seller shall pay to Buyer in cash the amount of such excess.
All amounts payable under this Section 1.3(c) shall be paid within
three business days of the determination of the Final Closing Statement by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account in the United
States of America designated in writing by the recipient not less than one
business day before such payment.   (d) Seller and Buyer hereby agree that,
on or before the Closing Date, Seller shall take all such actions as may be
necessary or appropriate to pay in full, offset, dividend or distribute to
the Seller or its Affiliates or otherwise to cancel without payment, all
intercompany accounts (whether classified as short-term or long term
accounts) between the Company, on the one hand, and Seller and any Person
which, as of the date of this Agreement, is or, prior to Closing, becomes an
Affiliate of Seller (other than the Company), on the other hand, other than
amounts due under the contract described in Item 2 of Schedule 2.16(e);
provided, however, that Buyer may, on or prior to May 1, 2003, notify Seller
that Buyer shall assume from Seller, as of the Closing Date, Seller\'s
obligations to Company that are reflected in the outstanding balance as of
the Closing Date of "Advances to Affiliates" shown in the Closing
Statement pursuant to the Intercompany Note Agreement described on Schedule
2.16(c). Any assumption of liabilities by Buyer under the previous sentence
shall be implemented by an assignment and assumption agreement reasonably
acceptable to Seller. Seller shall be responsible for all checks issued in
connection with the Company prior to the Closing Date but that have not
cleared as of the Closing Date.   4     ARTICLE II.  REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER   As of the date hereof, Seller hereby represents
and warrants to Buyer as follows:   SECTION 2.1. CORPORATE
ORGANIZATION.   The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of Delaware. Seller
is a limited liability company, duly formed, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the state of Delaware. The Company has all
requisite power and authority and all governmental licenses, authorizations,
permits, consents and approvals to own its properties and assets and to
conduct its business as now conducted, except where the failure to have such
licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals would not have a
Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 9.16). The Company is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned or leased by it or
the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
would not individually or in the aggregate be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 2.1 sets forth all of the jurisdictions in
which the Company is qualified to do business.   SECTION 2.2.
CAPITALIZATION; TITLE.   All of the outstanding Shares of the Company are
owned of record and beneficially by Seller. All of the Shares have been
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. Except for this
Agreement, there are no outstanding options, warrants, agreements, conversion
rights, preemptive rights or other rights to subscribe for, purchase or
otherwise acquire the Shares. There are no voting trusts or other agreements
or understandings to which Seller or the Company is a party with respect to
the voting of the Shares. There is no indebtedness of the Company having
general voting rights issued and outstanding. Except for this Agreement,
there are no outstanding obligations of any Person to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire outstanding Shares or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable for any Shares. Seller has valid and marketable title to the
Shares free and clear of any Encumbrances. True and correct copies of the
Organizational Documents (defined below) of the Company with all amendments
thereto to the date hereof, have been made available by Seller to the Buyer
or its representatives. "ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS" shall mean certificates of
incorporation, by-laws, certificates of formation, limited liability
company operating agreements, partnership or limited partnership agreements
or other formation or governing documents of a particular entity.   SECTION
2.3. SUBSIDIARIES AND EQUITY INTERESTS.   TGT Sub and the LLC are the only
subsidiaries, direct or indirect, of the Company, and except for the
ownership interests in the Retained Entities and as provided in Schedule 2.3,
the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any shares of capital
stock, voting rights or other equity interests or investments in any other
Person. The Company is not subject to any obligation or requirement to make
any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or similar
payment) to or in any other Person, except as provided in Schedule 2.3. The
Company   5    does not have any rights to acquire by any means,
directly or indirectly, any capital stock, voting rights, equity interests or
investments in another Person.   SECTION 2.4. VALIDITY OF AGREEMENT;
AUTHORIZATION.   Each of Seller and Parent has the power to enter into this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents (as defined herein) to which such
Person is a party and to carry out its obligations hereunder and thereunder.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to
which Seller or Parent is a party and the performance by Seller or Parent of
its obligations hereunder and thereunder have been duly authorized by the
Board of Directors of Parent and the Management Committee of Seller, and no
other proceedings on the part of Seller or Parent are necessary to authorize
such execution, delivery and performance. This Agreement and the Transaction
Documents to which Seller or Parent is a party have been duly executed by
such Person and constitute such Person\'s valid and binding obligation
enforceable against such Person in accordance with their terms (except to the
extent that its enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other similar law affecting the enforcement of
creditors\' rights generally or by general equitable principles).   SECTION
2.5. NO CONFLICT OR VIOLATION.   Except as set forth on Schedule 2.5, the
execution, delivery and performance by Seller and Parent of this Agreement
and the Transaction Documents to which Seller or Parent is a party does not
and will not: (a) violate or conflict with any provision of the
Organizational Documents of Seller or Parent; (b) violate any applicable
provision of law, statute, judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree, award,
rule, or regulation of any foreign, federal, tribal, state or local
government, court, arbitrator, agency or commission or other governmental or
regulatory body or authority ("GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY"); (c) violate, result
in a breach of, constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or both) a
default or cause any obligation, penalty or premium to arise or accrue under
any contract, lease, loan agreement, mortgage, security agreement,
trust indenture or other agreement or instrument to which Seller, Parent or
the Company is a party or by which either of them is bound or to which any of
their respective properties or assets is subject; (d) result in the creation
or imposition of any Encumbrance upon any of the properties or assets of
the Company; or (e) result in the cancellation, modification, revocation
or suspension of any License (as defined in Section 2.13) of the Company,
except in the cases of clauses (b) - (e) above as would not be reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 2.6. CONSENTS AND
APPROVALS.   Except as disclosed on Schedule 2.6, no material consent,
approval or authorization of, or filing, registration or qualification with,
any Governmental Authority or any other Person (on the part of Seller or
the Company), is required as a condition to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which either of them is a
party or the performance of their respective obligations hereunder or
thereunder.   SECTION 2.7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.   (a) Seller has
heretofore furnished to Buyer copies of the audited consolidated financial
statements of the Company as of December 31, 2002 and the notes thereto (the
"FINANCIAL   6    STATEMENTS"). The Financial Statements were prepared
from the books and records of the Company in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods covered thereby ("GAAP"). The Financial Statements present fairly in
all material respects the consolidated financial position, results of
operations and cash flows of the Company as of such dates and for the periods
then ended.   (b) The Company has filed all required forms, reports and
documents, and amendments thereto, with the SEC since January 1, 2001 (the
"SEC REPORTS"), each of which complied in all material aspects with all
applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"SECURITIES ACT"), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"EXCHANGE ACT"), each as in effect on the dates such forms, reports, and
documents, and amendments thereto were filed. None of the SEC Reports,
including without limitation, any financial statements or schedules included

suffered by Seller Indemnified Parties relating to, resulting from, or
arising out of, examinations or inspections made by Buyer or its authorized
representatives under this Section 4.2(a).   (b) Upon the reasonable

guidelines, guidances or legal counsel regarding the appropriate manner in
which to conduct such pre-Closing activities. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller and the Company, on the
other hand, will continue to operate as independent companies prior to

90 calendar days prior notice to such effect shall be given to the other
party, and such other party shall be given an opportunity, at its cost and
expense, to remove and retain all or any part of such books and records that
the notifying party elects to dispose of. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
party agrees that it shall preserve and keep all books and records of the
Company, TGT Sub and the LLC in its possession relating to any audit or
investigation instituted by a Governmental Authority or any litigation
(whether or not existing on the Closing Date), in each case of which it has
actual knowledge, until any such audit, investigation or proceeding has been
completed or finally resolved (and became non-appealable), if it
is reasonably likely that such audit investigation or litigation may relate
to matters occurring prior to the Closing, without regard to the 6-year
period set forth in this Section 4.2(c).   23     SECTION 4.3. EMPLOYEE
MATTERS.   (a) Within fifteen (15) days after the execution of this
Agreement, representatives of Buyer and Seller shall meet to identify
employees of Seller or any of its Affiliates who are not Business Employees
and to whom Buyer and Seller agree that Buyer, the Company or any Affiliate
of Buyer may make offers of employment (collectively, the "AVAILABLE

employment effective as of the Closing Date to each Available Employee, any
such offers of employment made by the Buyer to an Available Employee shall be

their eligible dependents and beneficiaries).   (c) On or as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, Seller shall cause to be transferred from
The Williams Companies, Inc. Master Trust to a trust established or
maintained by the Buyer, the Company or another Affiliate of Buyer an amount
of cash equal to the fair market value of the assets attributable to the
Texas Gas Retirement Plan as of the Closing Date. If the amount transferred
to Buyer is less than $93,778,415, then Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer in
cash the amount of such shortfall less Seller\'s and its Affiliates\'
transaction costs to convert non-cash assets to cash.   (d) On or as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, provided that Treasury Regulation
1.414(l)-1(h) is satisfied under the de minimis rule, Seller shall cause to
be transferred from the trust(s) of any "employee pension benefit plan(s)"
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA, which is qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code, covering any Additional Employees to a trust maintained
by Buyer, the Company or another Affiliate of Buyer contemplated in the
foregoing paragraph, an amount of cash equal to the greater of (A)
the Projected Benefit Obligation ("PBO" ) reflected in Seller\'s or its
applicable Affiliate\'s audited financial statements as of December 31, 2002
for such Additional Employees, and (B) the amount required to be transferred,
if any, under section 414(l) of the Code as reasonably determined by
Seller\'s or its applicable Affiliate\'s enrolled actuary and agreed to by
Buyer\'s enrolled actuary. The determination of such PBO shall be in
accordance with the actuarial assumptions used to determine Seller\'s or its
applicable Affiliate\'s December 31, 2002 PBO in total, as such is disclosed
in such entity\'s audited financial statements. If the de minimus rule in
Treasury Regulation 1.414(1)-1(h) is not satisfied, then at Buyer\'s sole
election, Seller shall either (i) transfer the maximum amount of cash
permitted to be transferred for any affected Additional Employee pursuant to
such Treasury Regulation, or (ii) retain the assets and related  
24    benefits accrued through the Closing Date with respect to such
Additional Employee. For any transfer(s) made to Buyer in accordance with
this subsection (d), from and after the date of such transfer(s), the Texas
Gas Retirement Plan shall be responsible for the benefits accrued through the
Closing Date with respect to such Additional Employees.   (e) Effective as
of the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume, or shall cause the Company or
another Affiliate of Buyer to assume, Seller\'s obligation for providing
severance to former employees of the Company and for providing retiree
medical and retiree life benefits to Retiree Plan Participants (and their
eligible dependents) under the Employee Plans set forth in Schedule 2.18(a),
in each case, to the extent accrued on the books of the Company as
of December 31, 2002 or reflected as a current liability on the Final
Closing Statement. On or as soon as practicable after the Closing Date,
Seller shall cause to be transferred from the Transco Energy Company Master
Employee Welfare Benefit Trust to a VEBA trust established or maintained by
Buyer, the Company or another Affiliate of Buyer an amount of cash equal to
the fair market value as of the Closing Date of the assets attributable to
providing retiree medical benefits and/or life benefits to Retiree Plan
Participants. If the amount transferred to Buyer from such trust is less than
$60,788,820, then Seller shall promptly pay to a VEBA trust established or
maintained by Buyer in cash the amount of such shortfall less Seller\'s and
its Affiliates\' transaction costs to convert non-cash assets to cash.  
(f) With respect to Additional Employees, effective as of the date of hire,
Buyer shall assume, or shall cause the Company or another Affiliate of Buyer
to assume, Seller\'s or its applicable Affiliate\'s obligation for
providing retiree medical and retiree life benefits to such employees if such
employees have met the eligibility requirements for participation in any
employee plan sponsored or maintained by Seller or the applicable Affiliate
that provides health, life insurance or other welfare benefits to retirees.
On or as soon as practicable after the date of hire of those Additional
Employees for whom Seller maintains an account in Seller\'s VEBA trust,

trust established or maintained by Buyer, the Company, or another Affiliate
of Buyer an amount of cash equal to the Accumulated Post-retirement Benefit
Obligations as of December 31, 2002 reflected in Seller\'s or its applicable
Affiliate\'s audited financial statements as of such date for such Additional
Employees.   (g) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume, or

Business Employees and former employees of the Company (including their
eligible dependents and beneficiaries) who, immediately prior to the Closing
Date, are totally disabled, and therefore receiving benefits under The
Williams Companies, Inc. Long-Term Disability Plan to the extent accrued on
the books of the Company as of December 31, 2002 or reflected as a current

account balances in any defined contribution or 401(k) Plan maintained by
Seller on behalf of such Transferred Employees (the "SELLER SAVINGS PLAN")
and distributions of such account balances shall be made available to such
Transferred Employees as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, in
accordance with, the provisions of Seller Savings Plan and applicable law.

and its   26     Affiliates shall not be precluded from hiring any such
employee who (y)  initiates discussions regarding such employment without any
direct or  indirect solicitation by Buyer or its Affiliates or (z) responds
to any  public advertisement placed by Buyer or its Affiliates; and   (ii)
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall, directly  or indirectly,
induce any of the Transferred Employees to leave the  employ of Buyer or any
of its Affiliates that engages in the business  of the transportation of
hydrocarbons or employ or otherwise engage or  retain (as an independent
contractor, consultant or otherwise) any such  Transferred Employee, except
that Seller and its Affiliates shall not  be precluded from hiring any such
employee who (y) initiates  discussions regarding such employment without any
direct or indirect  solicitation by Seller or its Affiliates or (z) responds
to any public  advertisement placed by Seller or its Affiliates.   (m) As
of the Closing Date, Buyer agrees to cause the Company\'s cafeteria plan
established pursuant to subsection (o) below (the "BUYER\'S 125 PLAN") to
accept a spin-off of the flexible spending reimbursement accounts from the
Seller\'s cafeteria plan in which Transferred Employees participated as
of the Closing (the "SELLER\'S 125 PLAN") and to honor and continue through
the end of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs the elections
made by each Transferred Employee under the Seller\'s 125 Plan in respect of
the flexible spending reimbursement accounts that are in effect immediately
prior to the Closing Date. As soon as practicable following the Closing Date,
Seller shall cause to be transferred to Buyer an amount in cash equal to the
excess of the aggregate accumulated contributions to the flexible spending
reimbursement accounts made during the year in which the Closing Date occurs
by the Transferred Employees over the aggregate reimbursement payouts made
for such year from such accounts to the Transferred Employees. If the
aggregate reimbursement payouts made to a Transferred Employee prior to
Closing from the flexible reimbursement account of such employee in the
Seller\'s 125 Plan during the year in which the Closing Date occurs exceeds
the aggregate accumulated contributions to such account prior to Closing for
such year by such employee, Buyer shall cause such excess to be transferred
to Seller as soon as practicable, and solely to the extent of, the receipt of
contributions from such employee to Buyer\'s 125 Plan. On and after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall assume and be solely responsible for all
reimbursable claims by the Transferred Employees under the Seller\'s 125
Plan, whether incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date, that have not
been paid in full as of the Closing Date.   (n) Except for Business
Employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement, until at least
December 31, 2003, Buyer shall provide or cause to be provided to all
Transferred Employees a salary or wage level at least equal to 90% of the
salary or wage level to which they were entitled immediately prior to the
Closing Date and bonus opportunity at least equal to 90% of the
bonus opportunity to which they were entitled immediately prior to the
Closing Date; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section
4.3(n) shall affect Buyer\'s right to terminate any Transferred Employee for
cause.   (o) Prior to the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall each use
its commercially reasonable efforts to take all reasonably necessary actions,
in a timely manner, to enable Buyer to establish welfare plans for the
Company essentially identical to the Employee Plans listed as items 1-12 on
Schedule 2.18(a) with such conforming and other changes to reflect the change
in ownership   27    of the Company as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereunder and the transition of benefits to such plans (the
"MIRROR PLANS"). Buyer and Seller agree to otherwise cooperate as necessary
to effectuate the provisions of this Section 4.3 and to ensure an orderly
transition of payroll and benefits coverage with respect to the Transferred
Employees from the Employee Plans to the appropriate Mirror Plans, including
without limitation, (i) the administrative and processing services to be
provided by Seller to Buyer pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement,
and (ii) causing the Company to establish one or more bank accounts for the
payroll of the Transferred Employees. (p) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall provide a list to Buyer of (i) the names of all retirees of the Company
currently receiving benefits under any Employee Plan and any Transferred
Employees and former employees of the Company who have met the requirements
for a vested or deferred vested pension in such plans (collectively, the
"RETIREE PLAN PARTICIPANTS"); (ii) any survivors of employees who died in
active employment or who are on disability that are entitled to benefits
under any Employee Plan; and (iii) target bonus for 2003 for each Transferred
Employee.   SECTION 4.4. CONSENTS AND APPROVALS.   Seller and Buyer each
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or in the case of
Seller, cause the Company to obtain, all necessary consents, waivers,
authorizations and approvals of all Governmental Authorities, and of all
other Persons required in connection with the execution, delivery
and performance by them of this Agreement and will cooperate fully with the
other party in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents,
orders, and approvals, giving such notices, and making such filings. To the
extent required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976
(the "HSR ACT"), each party shall (i) file or cause to be filed, as promptly
as practicable but in no event later than five business days after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, with the Federal Trade Commission
and the United States Department of Justice, all reports and other documents
required to be filed by such party under the HSR Act concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) promptly comply with or cause to be
complied with any requests by the Federal Trade Commission or the United
States Department of Justice for additional information concerning such
transactions, in each case so that the waiting period applicable to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act shall
expire as soon as practicable after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement. Each party agrees to request, and to cooperate with the other
party in requesting, early termination of any applicable waiting period under
the HSR Act.   SECTION 4.5. FURTHER ASSURANCES.   Upon the request of
Buyer at any time after the Closing Date, Seller will promptly execute and
deliver such further instruments of assignment, transfer, conveyance,
endorsement, direction or authorization and other documents as the requesting
party or parties or its or their counsel may reasonably request to perfect
title of Buyer and its successors and assigns to the Shares or otherwise to
effectuate the purposes of this Agreement.   28     SECTION 4.6.
REASONABLE EFFORTS.   Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto will use all commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable consistent with applicable
law to consummate and make effective in the most expeditious manner
practicable the transactions contemplated hereby.   SECTION 4.7. DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE UPDATES   (a) Seller shall have the right, until five (5) business
days prior to the Closing, to supplement the Disclosure Schedules with
respect to any matter or matters arising before the date hereof which would
have been required to be set forth on or described in the Disclosure
Schedules as of the execution date hereof that relate to the representations
and warranties in Article II (other than the last sentence of Section 2.8)
(an "EXECUTION UPDATE"). Any such Execution Update furnished to Buyer will
not be deemed to have been disclosed as of the date of this Agreement for
purposes of determining whether the conditions to Closing set forth in
Article V have been satisfied. If the Closing occurs and the Execution Update
includes a matter or matters that (i) were inadvertently omitted by Seller
from the applicable Disclosure Schedules on the execution date hereof, then
the Deductible shall be reduced, as of the Closing Date, by one-half of the
amount of the Loss incurred by Buyer as a result of the breach of the
applicable representation or warranty caused by such matter or matters and
(ii) were intentionally and willfully omitted by Seller from the
Disclosure Schedules on the execution date hereof, then the Deductible shall
not apply with respect to Buyer\'s right to seek indemnity under Article VIII
with respect to the Loss incurred by Buyer as a result of the breach of the
applicable representation or warranty.   (b) Seller shall have the right,
until five (5) business days prior to the Closing, to supplement the
Disclosure Schedules relating to the Seller\'s representations and warranties
in Article II and the covenant in Section 4.11 with respect to any matter or
matters arising on or after the date hereof which would have been required to
be set forth on or described in such Disclosure Schedules to correct any
information in any such Disclosure Schedule which has been rendered
inaccurate thereby; provided that the addition of such matter or matters
added with respect to the covenant in Section 4.11 were permitted actions by
Seller or the Company under Section 4.1(a) (a "POST-EXECUTION UPDATE "). Any
such Post-Execution Update furnished to Buyer will not be deemed to have been
disclosed as of the date of this Agreement for purposes of
determining whether the conditions to Closing set forth in Article V have
been satisfied but if Closing occurs, such Post-Execution Update shall be
deemed to have cured any breach of a representation or warranty relating to
the matters set forth in such Post-Execution Update for purposes of
indemnification pursuant to Article VIII.   SECTION 4.8. CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMATION.   For two (2) years after the Closing, Seller and its
Affiliates shall not, directly or indirectly, disclose to any Person any
information not in the public domain or generally known in the industry, in
any form, whether acquired prior to or after the Closing Date, relating
solely to the business and operations of the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller may disclose   29    any information relating to the
business and operations of the Company (i) if required by law or applicable
stock exchange rule, (ii) to other Persons in the conduct of Seller\'s or its
Affiliates\' other businesses which have a valid business purpose for
requiring such information, and such other Persons enter into a
confidentiality agreement with Seller similar to the
confidentiality agreement between Seller and Buyer dated February 3, 2003
(the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"), and provided, further, that Seller shall
be responsible for any improper disclosure by any such other Person as if
Seller itself had made such improper disclosure, and (iii) to such other
Persons if, at the time such information is provided, such Person is already
in the possession of such information.   SECTION 4.9. NEGOTIATIONS.  
From and after the date hereof, none of Seller, the Company nor its officers,
directors, employees, affiliates, stockholders, representatives, agents, nor
anyone acting on behalf of them shall, directly or indirectly, encourage,
solicit, engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide
any information to, any Person (other than Buyer or its representatives)
concerning any merger, sale of assets, purchase or sale of Shares or similar
transaction involving the Company unless this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to and in accordance with Article VII hereof.   SECTION 4.10. TAX
COVENANTS AND INDEMNITY.   (a) Parent shall cause to be included in the
consolidated federal income Tax Returns (and the state income Tax Returns of
any state that permits consolidated, combined or unitary income Tax Returns,
if any) of the Parent Group (as hereinafter defined) for all periods ending
on or before the Closing Date, all items of income, gain, loss, deduction or
credit of the Company that are required to be included therein, shall cause
such Tax Returns to be timely filed with the appropriate Tax authorities, and
shall be responsible for the timely payment of all Taxes due with respect to
the periods covered by such Tax Returns. On any such Tax Returns for a
taxable period ending on the Closing Date, the income of the Company will be
apportioned between the period up to and including the Closing Date and the
period after the Closing Date by closing the books of the Company as of the
end of the Closing Date. For purposes hereof, the "PARENT GROUP" shall mean
the affiliated group of corporations of which Parent (or any Affiliate of
Parent other than the Company) is the common parent, which join in the filing
of a consolidated federal income Tax Return (and any similar group under
state law).   (b) Seller shall prepare and file all Tax Returns relating to
the Company which are due prior to the Closing Date with the appropriate
federal, state, local and foreign Tax authorities, and shall pay, or cause to
be paid, the Taxes due thereon. For periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, but for which Tax Returns are not due prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall, not later than 15 days before the applicable due date, prepare and
submit to Buyer for review, signature, and filing all such Tax Returns
required to be filed by the Company, and Seller shall timely pay the Taxes
due thereon; provided, however, that Buyer shall prepare and file all Tax
Returns required to be filed by the Company for taxable periods ending after
the Closing Date and shall pay all Taxes due thereon; provided, further, that
Seller shall reimburse Buyer for its allocable share of any Taxes
attributable to Tax periods including the Closing Date and ending after the
Closing Date ("STRADDLE PERIOD") within twenty (20) days of a request by
Buyer for such reimbursement. Buyer and Seller shall utilize appropriate
methods to allocate liability for   30    purposes of the preceding
sentence, which appropriate methods shall include the following, without
limitation: (i) for any transactional Taxes, including, without limitation,
Taxes based on sales, revenue, or gross or net income, the allocation of
liability between Seller and Buyer shall be determined using a closing-of-
the-books method assuming that the applicable Tax period consists of two
taxable periods, one ending at the close of the Closing Date and
one beginning at the opening of the day after the Closing Date, and (ii) for
any real estate Taxes or other property or asset-based Taxes, the allocation
of liability between Seller and Buyer shall be based on the number of days
the applicable asset was held by the Company in the applicable Tax period
prior to and including the Closing Date as compared to the number of days the
applicable asset was held by the Company in the applicable Tax period after
the Closing Date.   (c) Seller will cause any tax sharing agreement or
similar arrangement with respect to Taxes involving the Company to be
terminated effective as of the Closing Date, to the extent any such agreement
or arrangement relates to the Company, and after the Closing Date the Company
shall not be bound by or have any obligation under any such agreement or
arrangement for any past, present or future period.   (d) All excise,
sales, use, transfer (including real property transfer or gains), stamp,
documentary, filing, recordation and other similar Taxes, together with any
interest, additions or penalties with respect thereto and any interest in
respect of such additions or penalties, resulting directly from
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "TRANSFER TAXES"), shall
be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 4.10, any Tax Returns that must be filed in
connection with Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and filed when due by the
party primarily or customarily responsible under the applicable local law for
filing such Tax Returns, and such party will use reasonable commercial
efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the other party at least 10 days prior
to the due date for such Tax Returns. If such a Tax Return is not timely
filed, any interest and penalties incurred as a result shall be the
responsibility of the filing party. In the event that any dispute between the
parties concerning the form or content of such Tax Returns cannot be timely
resolved prior to their due date through good-faith negotiation, the
determination of the filing party shall be controlling.   (e) At the
request of Buyer, in Buyer\'s sole discretion, Parent agrees to join Buyer in
making a timely, irrevocable and effective election under section 338(h)(10)
of the Code (and any comparable elections under state, local or foreign Tax
law) (collectively, the "SECTION 338(h)(10) ELECTION") with respect to the
acquisition of the Shares by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. Prior to the
due date for filing IRS Form 8023 and any similar forms under applicable
state, local or foreign income Tax law (the "FORMS"), Buyer and Parent shall
cause the Forms to be duly executed by an authorized Person for Buyer and
Parent, respectively. Buyer shall duly and timely file the Forms
as prescribed by Treasury Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 or the
corresponding provisions of applicable state, local or foreign income Tax
law. Buyer and Parent agree that the Purchase Price and the liabilities of
the Company (plus other relevant items) shall be allocated among the assets
of the Company for Tax purposes in the manner required under section 338 of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Buyer and
Parent shall endeavor in good faith to reach timely agreement on such
allocation. Buyer, Seller, Parent and the Company shall duly and timely file
the Forms and all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8883) in a manner
consistent with the two preceding   31    sentences. Buyer and Parent
shall cooperate fully with each other in the making of the Section 338(h)(10)
Election. Parent shall be responsible for all federal, state, local and
foreign income, franchise or similar Taxes resulting from the Section
338(h)(10) Election. In the event a state or local Tax authority does not
allow or respect the Section 338(h)(10) Election and treats the
federal Section 338(h)(10) Election as an election under Code Section 338(g)
for state or local income Tax purposes, Buyer shall be responsible (up to a
maximum responsibility of $100,000) for the excess, if any, of (1) the net
amount of state and local income, franchise or similar Taxes imposed by such
Tax authority on the actual sale of the Shares to Buyer and the deemed sale
of assets by the Company over (2) the amount of such Taxes that would have
been so imposed if such sale had instead been treated as a sale of the assets
of the Company followed by the liquidation of the Company, and Parent shall
be responsible for the remainder of such Taxes.   (f) Seller and Buyer
shall each promptly provide the other with such assistance as may reasonably
be requested by either of them in connection with the preparation of any Tax
Return, any audit or other examination by any Tax authority or any judicial
or administrative proceeding with respect to Taxes; and each shall retain in
accordance with its customary document retention policies (but at least until
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations) and promptly provide
the other with any records or other information which may be relevant to any
such return, audit examination or proceeding.   (g) Buyer shall, in the
event that Buyer or, following the Closing Date, the Company receives notice
(whether orally or in writing) of any audit, examination or claim by any
taxing authority with respect to Taxes for which Buyer or its Affiliates may
be indemnified hereunder (a "TAX CLAIM"), promptly notify Seller thereof,
provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall not affect
the right of Buyer to indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent
that Seller has been actually prejudiced by such failure. Except in the case
of Taxes imposed with respect to a Straddle Period, Seller shall have the
right to contest, at its own expense, any Tax Claim, and shall be entitled to
control any such contest, provided, however, that Seller shall not be
entitled to settle or compromise any such contest without the consent
of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, if
such settlement or compromise could affect the tax liability of Buyer or any
of its Affiliates for any period after the Closing Date, and provided,
further that Buyer may elect to participate, at its sole cost, with counsel
of its choice in any such contest. In the case of the contest of a Tax Claim
with respect to any Straddle Period, Seller shall have the right to
participate at its own expense in any such contest to the extent that the
outcome could affect the liability of Seller hereunder, and Buyer shall not
settle any such contest in a manner that could affect the liability of Seller
without Seller\'s consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. If Seller fails timely to defend, contest or otherwise protect
against any Tax Claim that it is entitled to control pursuant to this Section
4.10(g), Buyer shall have the right to do so, including, without limitation,
the right to make any compromise or settlement thereof, and Buyer shall be
entitled to recover the entire cost thereof from Seller, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys\' fees, disbursements and amounts paid as a
result of such Tax Claim.   (h) Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Buyer, the Company and any members of any group filing consolidated,
combined or unitary, federal, state or local income Tax Returns with Buyer or
the Company (collectively, the "BUYER TAX INDEMNITEES") from and against all
Losses (as defined in Section 8.2(a)) attributable to (i) Taxes of the
Company for any   32    Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date
and the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (determined
in accordance with Section 4.10(b)), (ii) Taxes attributable to the ownership
interests of the Company in, or the activities of, any of the Retained
Entities, and through the Closing Date, Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas
Transportation Company (iii) Taxes of any member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the Company (or any
predecessor) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar
state, local or foreign law or regulation, (iv) Taxes of any other Person
imposed on the Company as a transferee or successor, by contract
or otherwise, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring on or
before the Closing Date, (v) except as provided in the last sentence of
Section 4.10(e), any Taxes attributable to the Section 338(h)(10) Election,
or (vi) any breach of any representation or warranty made in Section 2.9 or
any covenants or agreements made by Seller or Parent in this Section 4.10.
Seller shall reimburse the appropriate Buyer Tax Indemnitee for any Losses
which are the responsibility of Seller under this Section 4.10(h) within
twenty (20) days after the payment of the underlying Taxes by the Buyer Tax
Indemnitee.   (i) Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller,
Parent and any members of any group filing consolidated, combined or unitary,
federal, state or local income Tax Returns with Seller or Parent
(collectively, the "SELLER TAX INDEMNITEES") from and against all Losses (as
defined in Section 8.2(a)) attributable to any breach of any covenants or
agreements made by Buyer in this Section 4.10. Buyer shall reimburse the
appropriate Seller Tax Indemnitee for any Losses which are the responsibility
of Buyer under this Section 4.10(i) within twenty (20) days after the payment
of the underlying Taxes by the Seller Tax Indemnitee.   (j) Article VIII,
other than Section 8.2(a)(i) (with respect to the representations and
warranties in Section 2.18), Section 8.2(a)(ii) (with respect to employee
benefit matters), Section 8.2(a)(iii), Section 8.8 and the limitations in
Section 8.1, shall not be applicable to Losses attributable to Taxes and the
rights and liabilities of the parties for indemnification of Losses
attributable to Taxes shall be governed solely by this Section 4.10.  
SECTION 4.11. INSURANCE, BONDS AND COLLATERAL.   (a) Prior to the Closing,
Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as
may be necessary or appropriate so that all surety bonds, letters of credit,
and cash collateral issued in respect of the Company listed on Schedule 4.11
(collectively, the "SELLER\'S BONDS") will be released and replaced
immediately after the Closing, and Buyer shall take such actions as are
necessary to replace and release all the Seller\'s Bonds not later than 30
days after the Closing Date by comparable surety bonds, letters of credit and
cash collateral provided by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer
("BUYER\'S BONDS"). Buyer shall reimburse Seller and its Affiliates for any
and all Losses (in each case without deduction or set off) incurred on
account of claims and payments made under or for the Seller\'s Bonds on or
after the Closing Date upon the receipt by Buyer of a written request
accompanied by reasonable documentation of the Losses for which reimbursement
is requested.   (b) From and after the Closing Date, except as provided in
this Section 4.11(b), coverage for the Company under the Policies will
terminate, and no new claims by or on behalf of the Company will accrue under
the Policies. Seller shall purchase and pay in full any premium for a  
33    discovery period under the Specified Policies (as such term is
defined in Section 9.16). This discovery period shall be effective as of the
Closing Date and shall terminate on May 1, 2006 at 12:01 a.m. Central time.
Such discovery period shall permit the Company to make claims under such
excess liability policies through April 30, 2006 to the extent such claims
relate to occurrences prior to the Closing Date and shall provide coverage to
the full extent of the policies in respect of such extended discovery period.
Seller will cause the Company to be named as an insured or additional insured
under such policies to the extent of such discovery period. After the Closing
Date, Seller or Parent shall continue to manage all workers\' compensation
and general liability and automobile liability claims of the Company, which
are known and reported on or prior to the Closing Date, or which are covered
under any insurance policy shown on Schedule 2.19. Seller shall be
responsible for workmen\'s compensation claims by employees of the Company
based upon pre-Closing occurrences, including related deductibles and
administrative costs. Buyer shall be responsible for the deductible (to the
extent not previously satisfied) in respect of claims (other than workmen\'s
compensation claims) made against or by or on behalf of the Company prior to
the Closing under the automobile general liability and excess liability
policies of Parent maintained for the Williams Companies\' group, but Seller
shall be responsible for the other costs on account of such
claims, including, without limitation, third party administration charges.
Buyer shall be responsible for all costs on account of claims (other than
workmen\'s compensation claims) made by or on behalf of the Company based on
a pre-Closing occurrence when the claim is made after the Closing for all
costs in excess of insurance on account of such claims, including, without
limitation, deductibles and third party administration charges.   SECTION
4.12. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.   (a) Upon the execution of this Agreement,
the parties shall each designate representatives to a migration team ("IT
MIGRATION TEAM") that shall be responsible for identifying all data, the
specific software and hardware and related documentation and development
materials, and agreements for the use, maintenance, training, support or
service thereof necessary for Buyer to continue operations of the Company
including, without limitation, all financial, accounting, operations,
maintenance, billing, human resources and other aspects of the operations of
the Company in the ordinary course at a level of quality and efficiency at
least equal to the level experienced by the Company for the period commencing
January 1, 2002 through the Closing Date (the "IT STANDARD"), including any
Software listed on Schedule 2.12(a) that the IT Migration Team determines
should be transferred to the Company in order to meet the IT Standard ("IT
ASSETS"). The IT Migration Team shall also be responsible for developing
a detailed plan to include cost estimates and timetables for: (i)
successful conversion and loading of existing Company data, (ii) integration
of the IT Assets into Buyer\'s or its Affiliate\'s information technology
systems, (iii) transfer or replacement of IT Asset licenses and maintenance
agreements not currently held in Company\'s name and (iv) any post-closing
transitional services reasonably required by Buyer or the Company to meet the
IT Standard ("IT MIGRATION PLAN"). The Migration Team shall complete the
preparation of the IT Migration Plan no later than 30 days after execution of
this Agreement. If the members of the IT Migration Team are unable to agree
on aspects of the IT Migration Plan within such 30-day period, Buyer and
Seller may request, at the option of either party and by notice to the other
party, that their differences be resolved by a nationally recognized
information technology consulting firm selected jointly by Buyer and Seller.
If Buyer and Seller are unable to so select the nationally  
34    recognized information technology consulting firm within five days
of any such notice, either Buyer or Seller may thereafter request that the
CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution make such selection (as applicable, the
firm selected by Buyer and Seller or the firm selected by the CPR Institute
for Dispute Resolution is referred to as the "IT FIRM"). The parties shall
direct the IT Firm to use its reasonable best efforts to render its
resolution within 30 days after any disagreement is submitted by the parties.
The fees and expenses of the IT Firm shall be shared equally by Buyer and
Seller. Upon completion of the IT Migration Plan, the IT Migration Team
promptly shall begin the pre-Closing implementation of the IT Migration Plan
in order for the parties to complete the post-Closing transfer, conversion
and loading of the Company data from Seller to Buyer or Buyer\'s designated
Affiliates, all in accordance with the IT Migration Plan. The time for
completion and execution of the IT Migration Plan shall be referred to as the
"IT MIGRATION PERIOD." The respective rights, benefits and obligations of the
parties, their Affiliates and the Company shall be addressed in the IT
Migration Plan, including the provision of various services and products by
Seller and its Affiliates to Buyer. The obligations of Seller, Buyer and the
Company for the respective post-Closing transition period specified for such
services or products in the IT Migration Plan, will be set forth in
an agreement to be substantially in the form of the Transition Services
Agreement attached as Exhibit 4.12 to be executed and delivered by Seller,
Buyer and the Company at Closing (the "TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT").  
(b) On or before the expiration of the IT Migration Period and in accordance
with the IT Migration Plan, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to
either: (i) assign to Buyer or the Company all of their respective right,
title and interest in the IT Assets, including license and contract rights
and secure any consents necessary for such assignment; (ii) with respect to
license and software rights that, in accordance with the IT Migration
Plan, are to be retained by Seller and its Affiliates during the IT Migration
Periods, secure any consents necessary for the use by Seller and its
Affiliates of the IT Assets on behalf of the Company or Buyer during the IT
Migration Period; or (iii) if requested by Buyer, obtain for the Buyer or its
designated Affiliate, on commercially reasonable terms and at Buyer\'s
expense, comparable replacements for any IT Assets not assigned pursuant to
(i) above. Fees for license transfers or comparable replacements shall be
borne by Buyer. Costs related to Seller\'s employees and contractors involved
in the preparation and implementation of the IT Migration Plan shall be borne
by Seller, and costs and expenses related to Buyer\'s employees and
contractors involved in the preparation and implementation of the IT
Migration Plan shall be borne by Buyer.   SECTION 4.13. SOFTWARE
LICENSE.   Effective upon the Closing Date, Seller, for itself and on behalf
of its Affiliates, hereby grants to the Company, Buyer and its Affiliates,
an irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual license, without right

Closing Date. Ownership of all Intellectual Property rights in the Licensed

not permit any of its Affiliates to, take any action inconsistent with
Seller\'s and its Affiliates\' rights in the Licensed Software. All rights
not expressly granted herein to the Company and Buyer are retained by Seller
and its Affiliates. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT,
THE LICENSED SOFTWARE AND ANY RELATED DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS

no indemnification for any Losses  asserted against Seller under Section

which point Seller  shall be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified

shall be reduced by any  third-party insurance or other indemnification
benefits which such  party receives in respect of or as a result of such
Losses. If any  Losses for which indemnification is provided hereunder are
subsequently  reduced by any third-party insurance or other indemnification
benefit  or recovery, the amount of the reduction shall be remitted to the 
Indemnifying Party;   (iv) any calculation of Losses for purposes  of

tax consequences to Seller Indemnified Party or Buyer  Indemnified Party
seeking indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII  hereof, as the case

circumstances with respect to the  subject matter of such claim or action on
or prior to the date on which  the representation or warranty or covenant on
which such claim or  action is based ceases to survive as set forth in
Section 8.1;   (vi) an Indemnified Party shall not be  entitled under this
Agreement to multiple recovery for the same Losses;   (vii) the limitations
on indemnification set  forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 8.2(c)

Sections 2.2 or  2.17; and   (viii) any indemnification for Losses 
asserted by Buyer under Section 8.2(a)(iv) that relate to a Person\'s 
exposure both before and after the Closing Date shall be reduced to the 
extent such Losses resulted from Buyer\'s, the Company\'s or any of its  or
their representatives\' or contractors\' failure to comply with  applicable
Environmental Laws when abating, managing, treating, or  otherwise handling
asbestos after the Closing Date in any of the  buildings or facilities that
are subject to the indemnity in Section  8.2(a)(iv).   SECTION 8.3.
PROCEDURES.   (a) Any Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party
(with reasonable specificity) promptly after it becomes aware of facts
supporting the commencement of or the assertion of any claim or action, suit
or proceeding by a third party in respect of which indemnification under this
Article VIII may be sought (each, a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM"), and shall provide
to the Indemnifying Party as soon as practicable thereafter copies of all
papers served (if any) with respect to such Third Party Claim. Subject to
Section 8.2(c)(v), the failure to so notify or provide information to the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability
that it may have to any Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying   45    Party is materially prejudiced by the Indemnified
Party\'s failure to give such notice, in which case the Indemnifying Party
shall be relieved from its obligations hereunder to the extent of such
material prejudice. If the Indemnifying Party does not dispute its potential
liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim,
then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, exercisable by written
notice to the Indemnified Party within ten days after receipt of notice from
the Indemnified Party of the Third Party Claim (each, a "ELECTION PERIOD"),
to participate in and defend, contest or otherwise protect the Indemnified
Party against any such claim, action, suit or proceeding with counsel of the
Indemnifying Party\'s choice (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party) at its sole cost and expense; provided, however,
that the Indemnifying Party shall not make any settlement or compromise
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the sole relief
provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party.
The Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
participate at its own expense in the defense thereof by counsel of the
Indemnified Party\'s choice and shall in any event use its reasonable
best efforts to cooperate with and assist the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party disputes its potential liability to the Indemnified Party,
does not elect within the Election Period to defend the claim or action or
fails to timely and diligently defend, contest or otherwise protect against
such suit, action, investigation, claim or proceeding, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to do so, including, without limitation, the right to
make any compromise or settlement thereof, and the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to recover the entire cost thereof from the Indemnifying Party,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\' fees, disbursements and
amounts paid as the result of such suit, action, investigation, claim or
proceeding. Payments of all amounts owing by the Indemnifying Party pursuant
to this Section 8.l3(a) shall be made not later than thirty (30) days after
the latest of (A) the settlement of the Third Party Claim, (B) the expiration
of the period for appeal of a final adjudication of such Third Party Claim or
(C) the expiration of the period for appeal of a final adjudication of the
Indemnifying Party\'s liability to the Indemnified Party under this
Agreement.   (b) If an Indemnified Party should have a claim against an
Indemnifying Party hereunder which does not involve a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall transmit a written indemnity notice to the
Indemnifying Party describing in detail the nature of the claim and the basis
of the Indemnified Party\'s request for indemnification under this Agreement
and including all supporting documentation. If the Indemnifying Party
notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not dispute such claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the Indemnified Party the amount of such claim
within thirty (30) days of such notice. If the Indemnifying Party disputes
such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party and
such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of
competent jurisdiction.   (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 8.3, should any Third Party Claim hereunder involve a situation
where the Indemnified Party reasonably anticipates that part of the claim
will be borne by it and part of the claim will be borne by the Indemnifying
Party due to the existence of the limitations in Section 8.2(c)(i) or (ii),
the parties shall jointly consult and proceed as to any such Third Party
Claim.   46     SECTION 8.4. WAIVER OF CONSEQUENTIAL, ETC. DAMAGES.  
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, BUYER SHALL NOT
BE LIABLE TO ANY OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, NOR SHALL SELLER
BE LIABLE TO ANY OF THE BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, FOR ANY EXEMPLARY,
PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, REMOTE, OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES OR
LOSSES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DAMAGES OR LOSSES ON ACCOUNT OF
LOST PROFITS OR OPPORTUNITIES) RESULTING FROM OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, EXCEPT FOR ANY OF THE
FOREGOING CONSTITUTING OR RESULTING FROM A THIRD PARTY CLAIM.   SECTION
8.5. COMPLIANCE WITH EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE.   ALL RELEASES, DISCLAIMERS,
LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY, AND INDEMNITIES IN THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THOSE
IN THIS ARTICLE VIII, SHALL APPLY EVEN IN THE EVENT OF THE SOLE, JOINT,
AND/OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER FAULT OF THE PARTY
WHOSE LIABILITY IS RELEASED, DISCLAIMED, LIMITED, OR INDEMNIFIED.   SECTION
8.6. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES.   If (a) Seller terminates this Agreement as
provided in Section 7.1(b), or (b) (i) the conditions to the obligations of
Buyer set forth in Article V have been satisfied, (ii) this Agreement has not
been terminated pursuant to Sections 7.1(a), (c), or (d), and (iii) the
Closing has not occurred by June 30, 2003, then Buyer shall pay to Seller a
sum equal to $40,000,000.00 by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to a bank account in the United States of America designated in writing by
Seller not later than three days following receipt of such designation. BUYER
HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (1) THE EXTENT OF DAMAGES TO SELLER CAUSED BY THE
FAILURE OF THIS TRANSACTION TO BE CONSUMMATED WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE OR
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN (2) THE AMOUNT OF THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
PROVIDED FOR IN THIS SECTION 8.6 IS A FAIR AND REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SUCH
DAMAGES UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND (3) RECEIPT OF SUCH AMOUNT BY SELLER DOES
NOT CONSTITUTE A PENALTY AND WILL BE SELLER\'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR
SUCH TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.   SECTION 8.7. REMEDY.   Except for
seeking equitable relief, from and after the Closing the sole remedy of a
party in connection with (i) a breach or inaccuracy of the representations,
or breach of warranties, in this Agreement or any certificates or other
