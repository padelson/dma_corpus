MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of July 2, 2000 is among EGL, Inc., a

and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Circle

RECITALS   WHEREAS, Parent and the Company have each determined to engage
in a strategic business combination with the other;   WHEREAS, in order to
effect the business combination of Parent and the Company, the parties hereto
desire to merge Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger"), with the
Company surviving as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, pursuant to
which each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company
(the "Company Common Stock") will be converted into the right to receive one
share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of Parent (the "Parent
Common Stock");   WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company have determined the Merger, in the manner contemplated
herein, to be desirable and in the best interests of their respective
corporations, shareholders and stockholders, and to be consistent with, and
in furtherance of, their respective business strategies and goals, and by
resolutions duly adopted, have approved and adopted this Agreement;  
WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code");   WHEREAS, for
financial accounting purposes, it is intended that the Merger be accounted
for as a "pooling of interests" under U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles;   WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, Parent and the Company are executing and delivering (i) a
Stock Option Agreement dated the date hereof pursuant to which Parent has
granted to the Company an option to purchase a certain number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, and (ii) a Stock Option Agreement dated the date hereof
pursuant to which the Company has granted to Parent an option to purchase a
certain number of shares of Company Common Stock (such Stock Option
Agreements being collectively referred to herein as the "Stock Option
Agreements"); and   WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, (i) certain affiliates of the Company are entering into a
Stockholder Agreement with Parent providing for, among other things, the
voting of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such affiliates, and (ii)
an affiliate of Parent is entering into a Stockholder Agreement with the
Company providing for, among other things, the voting of shares of Parent
Common Stock owned by such    1   7   affiliate (such Stockholder
Agreements being collectively referred to herein as the "Stockholder
Agreements");    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and of
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein,
the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE 1   THE MERGER

at such later time that the parties hereto shall have agreed upon and
designated in the Certificate of Merger as the effective time of the Merger
(the "Effective Time").   Section 1.4 Plan of Reorganization. The parties to

COMMON STOCK   Section 4.1 Conversion of Company Stock.   (a) At the
Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of
Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and non-assessable share of common
stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   (b) At the
Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common
Stock (i) held in the Company\'s treasury or (ii) owned by Parent, Merger Sub
or any other wholly owned Subsidiary (as defined in Section 10.9) of Parent
or the Company) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Parent Common Stock
(the "Exchange Ratio").   (c) As a result of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of Company Common Stock
shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (a "Certificate")
representing any shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter cease to
have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except
the right to receive, without interest, a certificate representing shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash for fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with Sections 4.2(b) and 4.2(e) upon the surrender of such
Certificate.   (d) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and held in
the Company\'s treasury, and each share of Company Common Stock owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or the
Company shall, at the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, cease to be
outstanding and shall be canceled and retired without payment of any
consideration therefor, and no stock of Parent or other consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.   (e) (i) At the Effective Time, all
options (individually, a "Company Option" and collectively, the "Company
Options") then outstanding under the Company\'s 1982 Stock Option Plan, 1990
Stock Option Plan, Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors, 1994 Omnibus
Equity Incentive Plan, as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto, 1995 Stock
Option Plan for Non- Employee Directors, Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
Singapore Employee Stock Purchase Plan, Sharesave Scheme 2000, 1999 Stock
Option Plan, 2000 Stock Option Plan and 2000 Stock Option Plan for Non-
Employee Directors (collectively, the "Company Stock Option Plans") shall
remain outstanding following the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the
Company Options shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action
on the part of the Company or the holder of any Company Option, be assumed by
Parent in such manner that Parent (i) is a corporation "assuming a stock
option in a transaction to which Section 424(a) applied" within the meaning
of Section 424 of the Code or (ii) to the extent that Section 424 of the Code
does not apply to any Company Option,   4   10   would be such a
corporation were Section 424 of the Code applicable to such option. Each
Company Option assumed by Parent shall, solely to the extent provided by the
Company Stock Option Plans and the option agreements entered into pursuant
thereto, be accelerated and fully vested and exercisable as of the Effective
Time and shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as under
the applicable Company Stock Option Plan and the applicable option agreement
entered into pursuant thereto, except that (i) each Company Option shall be
exercisable for that whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) into which the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time would be converted under Section 4.1(b), (ii) the option
price per share of Parent Common Stock shall be an amount equal to the option
price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio
(the price per share, as so determined, being rounded upward to the nearest
full cent), and (iii) notwithstanding clause (i) and (ii) of this sentence,
with respect to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Singapore Employee
Stock Purchase Plan and the Sharesave Scheme 2000, the adjustment to the
option price shall reflect the application of the Exchange Ratio to the
option price in effect at the beginning of the purchase period.   (ii)
Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Company Options assumed
by Parent pursuant to this Section 4.1(e). From and after the date of this
Agreement, no additional options shall be granted by the Company or
its Subsidiaries under the Company Stock Option Plans or otherwise, except
as provided in Section 7.1(f), and no action shall be taken by the Company or
its Subsidiaries to provide for the acceleration of the exercisability of
any Company Options in connection with the Merger other than as required
under the terms of the Company Options and the Company Stock Option Plans.
Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a Registration Statement on Form S-8 (or
a post-effective amendment on Form S-8 with respect to the Form S-4 (as
defined in Section 7.9)) covering all shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued upon exercise of Company Options and shall cause such registration
statement to remain effective for as long as there are outstanding any
Company Options.   Section 4.2 Exchange of Certificates Representing Company
Common Stock.   (a) At or immediately following the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent
selected by Parent, which shall be Parent\'s transfer agent for the Parent
Common Stock or such other party reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the
"Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article 4, certificates
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock and the cash in lieu of
fractional shares (such cash and certificates for shares of Parent Common
Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto,
being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") to be issued pursuant
to Section 4.1 and delivered pursuant to this Section 4.2 in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.   (b) Promptly after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of one or more Certificates (other than to holders of Company   
5   11   Common Stock that, pursuant to Section 4.1(d), are canceled
without payment of any consideration therefor): (i) a letter of transmittal
(the "Letter of Transmittal") which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock and cash
in lieu of fractional shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such Letter of Transmittal,
duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
(A) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock and (B) a check representing the amount of cash in lieu of fractional
shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, which such
holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered
pursuant to the provisions of this Article 4, after giving effect to any
required withholding tax, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of
fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to
holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent
Common Stock, together with a check for the cash to be paid in lieu of
fractional shares, may be issued to such a transferee if the Certificate
representing such Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.  
(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, no dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid with respect to the shares to be issued upon exchange of
any Certificate until such Certificate is surrendered for exchange as
provided herein. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock and not paid, less the amount of any withholding taxes
which may be required thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock,
less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon.  
(d) At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation,
the presented Certificates shall be canceled and exchanged for
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article 4.
Certificates surrendered for exchange by any person who is a Rule 145
Affiliate (as    6   12  defined in Section 7.12) shall not be
exchanged until Parent has received a written agreement from such person as
provided in Section 7.12.   (e) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued pursuant hereto. In lieu of the issuance of any fractional
share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.1(b), cash adjustments
will be paid to holders in respect of any fractional share of Parent Common
Stock that would otherwise be issuable, and the amount of such cash
adjustment shall be equal to such fractional proportion of the average of the
per share closing prices of the Parent Common Stock as reported in the New
York City edition of The Wall Street Journal (or, if not reported thereby,
another authoritative source) for securities traded on the Nasdaq National
Market for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the fifth trading day
prior to the Closing Date, appropriately adjusted for any stock splits,
reverse stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or other similar
transactions.   (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds
of any investments thereof and any shares of Parent Common Stock) that
remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company one year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any former stockholders of
the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article 4 shall
thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of their shares of Parent Common
Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares and for unpaid dividends and
distributions on the shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable to such former
stockholder pursuant to this Agreement.   (g) None of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any
former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.   (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu
of fractional shares, and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of
Parent Common Stock as provided in Section 4.2(c), deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.   Section 4.3 Adjustment of Exchange
Ratio. In the event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior
to the Effective Time, the Company changes the number of shares of Company
Common Stock or Parent changes the number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
issued and outstanding as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction, the Exchange
Ratio and other items dependent thereon shall be appropriately adjusted.  
Section 4.4 Rule 16b-3 Approval. Parent and the Company each agree that its
Board of Directors shall, at or prior to the Effective Time, adopt
resolutions specifically approving, for purposes of Rule 16b-3 ("Rule 16b-3")
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended   7   13   (the
"Exchange Act"), the transactions contemplated by Section 4.1 hereof and any
other dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) or acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including
derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual
who (a) in the case of the Company is a director or officer of the Company
and (b) in the case of Parent is, or at the Effective Time will become, a
director or officer of Parent.    ARTICLE 5   REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Except as set forth in the disclosure letter
delivered to Parent concurrently with the execution hereof (the "Company
Disclosure Letter"), the Company represents and warrants to Parent that:  
Section 5.1 Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority. The Company is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. The Company is duly qualified
to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the
laws of any jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or
leased by it therein or in which the transaction of its business makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified does not
have and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section
10.9). The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now
conducted, except where the failure to possess such power and authority does
not have and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The copies of the Company\'s
certificate of incorporation and bylaws previously made available to Parent
are true and correct and contain all amendments as of the date hereof.  
Section 5.2 Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements. The Company has
the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, the Stock Option Agreements, the Stockholder Agreement to which it
is a party and all other agreements and documents contemplated hereby
and thereby. The consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the Stock Option Agreements has been duly authorized by all
requisite corporate action on behalf of the Company, other than the approvals
referred to in Section 5.22. This Agreement, the Stockholder Agreement to
which it is a party and the Stock Option Agreements constitute the valid and
legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with
their respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors\' rights and general
principles of equity (the "Enforceability Exceptions"). The Company has taken
all action necessary to render the restrictions set forth in Section 203 of
the DGCL inapplicable to the Merger, this Agreement, the Stock Option
Agreements, the Stockholder Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. No other U.S. or State takeover or business combination
statute to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject applies or
purports to apply to the Merger, this Agreement, the Stock Option Agreements,
the Stockholder Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. There is no foreign takeover or business combination statute that
applies or purports to apply to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which
would require any filing or the taking of any other action by the Company
or    8   14  its Subsidiaries as a result of the execution or delivery
of this Agreement, the Stock Option Agreements, the Stockholder Agreements or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and which would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect if such filing was not made or such action was not taken.

its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The
Company has no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the
holders of which have the right to vote (or which are convertible into or
exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of
the Company on any matter.   Section 5.4 Subsidiaries. Each of the
Company\'s Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership, limited liability
company or other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
(where applicable) under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization, has the corporate or partnership power and authority to own,
operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
(where applicable) in each jurisdiction in which the ownership, operation or
lease of its property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except for jurisdictions in which such failure to be so
qualified or to be in good standing (where applicable) does not have and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of, or other ownership interests in, each of the
Company\'s Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and

Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries own any
shares of capital stock or other ownership interests in any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company or other entity, except for shares of
capital stock or other ownership interests in the Company\'s
Subsidiaries.     9   15   Section 5.5 No Violation of Law. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any order of any
court, governmental authority or arbitration board or tribunal, or any law,
ordinance, governmental rule or regulation, U.S. or foreign, to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets is subject (including, without limitation, those (a) applicable to
indirect cargo carriers under the Federal Aviation Act, (b) adopted or
promulgated by the Surface Transportation Board, including, without
limitation, regulations applicable to motor carrier operations and truck
brokerage operations, (c) safety regulations applicable to interstate motor

Company Material Adverse Effect or (2) as pertains to laws, ordinances,
governmental rules or regulations, U.S. or foreign, relating to taxes paid or
payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to any of
their respective properties or assets, which matters are addressed in Section
5.10 hereof. The Company and its Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses,
variances, exemptions, orders, franchises and approvals of all governmental
authorities necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses
(the "Company Permits"), except where the failure so to hold does not have
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Company Permits, except
where the failure so to comply does not have and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, no investigation by any
governmental authority with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is pending or threatened, other than those the outcome of which would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.   Section 5.6 No Conflict.   (a) Neither the
execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement or the Stock Option
Agreements nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof
will: (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any provisions of the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company; (ii) violate, or
conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a
default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default) under, or result in the termination or in a right
of termination or cancellation of, or give rise to a right of purchase under,
or accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any
Lien upon any of the properties of the Company or its Subsidiaries under, or
result in being declared void, voidable, or without further    10  
16  binding effect, or otherwise result in a detriment to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise, permit
(including, without limitation, any Company Permit), lease, contract,
agreement, joint venture, sponsor agreement or other instrument or obligation
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their properties is bound or
affected; or (iii) contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of
any provision of any law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree binding
upon or applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such
matters described in clause (ii) or (iii) as do not and are not likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.    (b) Neither the execution and delivery by the Company of
this Agreement or the Stock Option Agreements or the Stockholder Agreement to
which it is a party nor the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in accordance with the terms
hereof or thereof will require any consent, approval or authorization of, or
filing or registration with, any governmental or regulatory authority, U.S.
or foreign (including, without limitation, under the Specified Governmental
Regulations), other than (i) the filings provided for in Article 1 and (ii)
the filings required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), any applicable non-U.S. competition,
antitrust or premerger notification laws or regulations ("Non-U.S. Antitrust
Laws"), the Exchange Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), or applicable state securities and "Blue Sky" laws ((i)
and (ii) collectively, the "Regulatory Filings"), and (iii) listing on the
Nasdaq National Market of the Company Common Stock to be issued upon exercise
of the option granted to Parent pursuant to the applicable Stock Option
Agreement.   Section 5.7 SEC Documents. The Company has made available
to Parent each registration statement, report, proxy statement or
information statement (other than preliminary materials) filed by the Company
with the SEC since December 31, 1999, each in the form (including exhibits
and any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC (collectively, the "Company
Reports"). As of their respective dates, the Company Reports (i) were
prepared in all material respects in accordance with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except for such
statements, if any, as have been modified by subsequent filings with the SEC
prior to the date hereof. Each of the consolidated balance sheets of the
Company included in or incorporated by reference into the Company
Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated income statements,
consolidated statements of cash flows and consolidated statements of changes
in stockholders\' equity of the Company included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including any related notes and
schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the results of
operations, cash flows or changes in stockholders\' equity, as the case may
be, of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to (x) such exceptions as may
be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and (y) normal year-end audit
adjustments), in each case in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be
noted         11   17  therein. Except as reflected in such
financial statements, including all notes thereto, and except for liabilities
incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Stock Option Agreements or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), other than (i) liabilities and
obligations arising in the ordinary course of business since the date of such
financial statements and (ii) liabilities or obligations which do not have
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate (together with those described in clause (i)), a Company Material
Adverse Effect. As of December 31, 1999 and as of May 31, 2000, the
intercompany suspense amounts (the difference between the
intercompany payables and receivables) in the Company\'s accounting records
represent in process transactions that will be completed in a subsequent
accounting period. The Company has established reserves which management
believes are appropriate to properly record the intercompany balance to its
net realizable amount in all material respects.   Section 5.8 Litigation;
Decrees. There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Company\'s knowledge,
threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, at law or in
equity, or before or by any federal, state or foreign commission, board,
bureau, agency or instrumentality, that have had or would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. There are no outstanding judgments, decrees, injunctions,
awards or orders against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that have or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Except for such matters as do not and are
not likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) no order, writ,
fine, injunction, decree, judgment, award or determination of any court or
governmental authority has been issued or entered against the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company that continues to be in effect that affects the
ownership or operation of any of their respective assets, and (ii) no
criminal order, writ, fine, injunction, decree, judgment or determination of
any court or governmental authority has been issued against the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company.   Section 5.9 Absence of Certain Changes.
From March 31, 2000 through the date of this Agreement there has not been (i)
any event or occurrence that has had or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) any
material change by the Company in its accounting methods, principles or
practices or its tax methods, practices or elections, (iii) any declaration,
setting aside or payment of any dividend or distribution in respect of any
capital stock of the Company or any redemption, purchase or other acquisition
of any of its securities, except dividends on the Company Common Stock at a
rate of not more than $0.135 per share per semiannual payment, or (iv) any
increase in or establishment of any bonus, insurance, severance, deferred
compensation, pension, retirement, profit sharing, stock option, stock
purchase or other employee benefit plan, except in the ordinary course of
business.   Section 5.10 Taxes.   (a) Each of the Company, its
Subsidiaries and each affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or similar
group of which any such corporation is or was a member has (i) duly filed (or
there has been filed on its behalf) on a timely basis with appropriate
governmental     12   18  authorities all tax returns, statements,
reports, declarations, estimates and forms required to be filed by or with
respect to it on or prior to the date hereof, except to the extent that any
failure to file does not have and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, and (ii)
duly paid or deposited in full on a timely basis or made adequate provisions
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (or there has
been paid or deposited or adequate provision has been made on its behalf) for
the payment of all taxes required to be paid by it for all periods ended
through the date hereof, except to the extent that any failure to pay or
deposit or make adequate provision for the payment of such taxes does not
have and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (b) (i) The federal income
tax returns of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have been examined by
the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") (or the applicable statutes of
limitation for the assessment of federal income taxes for such periods have
expired) for all periods; (ii) except to the extent being contested in good
faith, all deficiencies asserted in writing as a result of such examinations
and any other examinations of the Company and its Subsidiaries by any taxing
authority have been paid, fully settled or adequately provided for in the
financial statements contained in the Company Reports, except for
deficiencies that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; (iii)
except as adequately provided for in the Company Reports, no
material federal, state, local or foreign income or franchise tax audits or
other administrative proceedings or court proceedings are presently pending
with regard to any federal, state, local or foreign income or franchise
taxes regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no material
deficiency for any such income or franchise taxes has been asserted or
assessed in writing pursuant to such examination against the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries by any federal, state, local or foreign taxing authority
with respect to any period; (iv) as of the date hereof, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted in writing any requests, agreements,
consents or waivers (that remain in effect) to extend the statutory period of
limitations applicable to the assessment of any taxes with respect to any tax
returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and (v) neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, is bound by or has any
obligation under any tax sharing or similar agreement (other than agreements
between the Company and its Subsidiaries).   (c) Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has executed or entered into (or prior to the close
of business on the Closing Date will execute or enter into) with the IRS or
any other taxing authority any material closing agreement pursuant to Section
7121 of the Code, or any predecessor provision thereof or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign income tax law that relates to the
assets or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would
require payment of taxes after the Closing Date.   (d) Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has made an election under Section 341(f) of the
Code or agreed to have Section 341(f)(2) of the Code apply to any disposition
of a subsection (f) asset (as such term is defined in Section 341(f)(4) of
the Code) owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.     13  
19   (e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a United
States real property holding corporation within the meaning of
Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable period specified in
Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.   For purposes of this Agreement,
"tax" or "taxes" means all net income, gross income, gross receipts, sales,
use, ad valorem, transfer, accumulated earnings, personal holding company,
excess profits, franchise, profits, license, withholding, payroll,
employment, excise, severance, stamp, occupation, premium, property,
disability, capital stock, or windfall profits taxes, customs duties or other
taxes, fees, assessments or charges of any kind whatsoever, together with any
interest and any penalties, additions to tax or additional amounts imposed by
any taxing authority (domestic or foreign).   Section 5.11 Employee Benefit
Plans. For purposes of this Section 5.11, all references to the "Company"
shall be deemed to refer to the Company and any trade or business, whether or
not incorporated, that together with the Company would be (or, during the six
years prior to the date of this Agreement, has been) deemed or treated as a
"single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001 of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), or Code Section
414. Schedule 5.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a list of all
employee benefit plans and other benefit arrangements, including any stock
purchase, stock option, pension, profit-sharing, retirement, bonus, deferred
compensation, incentive compensation, commission, severance or termination
pay, hospitalization, medical, dental, disability, life or other insurance,
or supplemental unemployment benefits plan, policy, contract, practice or
other arrangement, whether or not subject to ERISA or U.S. based and whether
written or oral, that is, or within the six year period preceding the date
hereof has been, sponsored, maintained or contributed to or required to
be contributed to by the Company for the purpose of providing service-
or employment-related compensation or benefits to any current or former
officer, director, employee, retiree or independent contractor of the Company
or members of their respective families (other than directors\' and
officers\' liability policies), whether or not insured, including, without
limitation, benefits that are required to be provided under applicable law
(the "Company Benefit Plans"). True and complete copies of the Company
Benefit Plans and, if applicable, the most recent Form 5500, IRS
determination letter, actuarial report, summary plan description, trust or
other funding agreement and annual report for each such plan have been made
available to Parent. The Company has no commitment or obligation to establish
or adopt any new or additional plans or other arrangements that would
constitute Company Benefit Plans if adopted, or to increase materially the
benefits under any existing Company Benefit Plan. All applicable reporting
and disclosure requirements have been met with respect to the Company Benefit
Plans except for any noncompliance that does not have and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. To the extent applicable, the Company Benefit Plans
comply, and have been operated in compliance, in all material respects, with
the requirements of all applicable laws, rules and regulations,
including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code and the requirements of any
applicable jurisdiction. With respect to any Company Benefit Plan intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (i) such plan has received a
determination letter from the IRS stating that it is so qualified and, to the
Company\'s knowledge, no event has occurred since the date of such letter
that would adversely affect such determination or (ii) the remedial amendment
period under Code Section 401(b) for such plan has not expired. The Company
Benefit Plans have been    14   20  maintained and operated, in all
material respects, in accordance with their terms. To the Company\'s
knowledge, there are no pending or anticipated claims against or otherwise
involving any Company Benefit Plan and no suit, action or other litigation
(excluding claims for benefits incurred in the ordinary course of Company
Benefit Plan activities) has been brought against or with respect to any such
Company Benefit Plan, except for any of the foregoing which does not have and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. All material contributions required to be
made as of the date hereof to the Company Benefit Plans have been made.
Neither the Company nor any Company Benefit Plan provides for medical, life
insurance or health benefits or other welfare benefits after a
Company employee\'s termination of employment (including retirement) except
for continuation coverage required pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code and
Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and the regulations thereunder or coverage
mandated by applicable law outside the U. S., and the Company has not
represented, promised or contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any
employee or former employee that such benefits would be provided. No Company
Benefit Plan is a voluntary employee\'s beneficiary association within the
meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. With respect to each Company
Benefit Plan, the present value of accrued benefits under such plan did not
exceed, as of its latest valuation date, the then current value of the assets
of such plan allocable to such accrued benefits or, to the extent the amount
by which the present value of the accrued benefits exceeds the current value
of plan assets, the financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
made available to Parent fairly reflect such liabilities in the aggregate. To
the Company\'s knowledge, no prohibited transaction has occurred with respect
to any Company Benefit Plan that would result in the imposition of any excise
tax or other liability under the Code or ERISA. The Company does not
contribute to, and has no obligation to contribute to, and has not within six
years prior to the Effective Time contributed to, or had an obligation to
contribute to, a multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA or any "employee pension benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA, that is subject to the funding requirements of Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code. The Company has no actual or contingent obligation
to make any payments that would be "excess parachute payments" under Section
280G of the Code. Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the performance
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under
any policy, arrangement, agreement or benefit plan, or any trust or loan,
that will or may result in any payment (whether of severance pay or
otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution,
increase in benefits or other compensation or obligations to fund benefits
with respect to any employee or former employee of the Company.   Section
5.12 Labor Matters. Except as does not have and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect, (i) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement, contract or
other agreement with a labor union or labor organization, U.S. or foreign,
and (ii) to the Company\'s knowledge, there are no organizational efforts
with respect to the formation of a collective bargaining unit presently being
made or threatened involving employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.    15   21    Section 5.13 Environmental Matters. Except
as does not have and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect:   (a) there are not
any past or present conditions or circumstances relating to any substances
defined as Hazardous Substances, Oils, Pollutants or Contaminants in the
National Oil and Hazardous Substance Pollution Contingency Plan, 40 C.F.R.
Section 300.5, or defined as such by, or regulated as such under, any
Environmental Law (as defined below) ("Hazardous Material") that interfere
with the conduct of the business of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
in the manner now conducted or which interfere with compliance with any order
of any court, governmental authority or arbitration board or tribunal, or any
law, ordinance, governmental rule or regulation related to pollution
or protection of human health or the environment ("Environmental Law");  
(b) there are not any past or present conditions or circumstances at, or
arising out of, any current or former businesses, assets or properties of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, including but not limited to on-
site or off-site disposal or release of any Hazardous Materials, which
would reasonably be expected to give rise to: (i) liabilities or obligations
for any cleanup, remediation, disposal or corrective action ("Cleanup") under
any Environmental Law, (ii) any fines or penalties or (iii) claims arising
for personal injury, property damage or damage to natural resources;   (c)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (i) given or received any
written notice of noncompliance with, violation of, or liability or potential
liability under any Environmental Law or (ii) entered into any consent decree
or order or is subject to any order of any court or governmental authority or
tribunal under any Environmental Law or relating to the Cleanup of any
Hazardous Materials;   (d) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
have transported or arranged for the transportation (directly or indirectly)
of any Hazardous Materials to any location which is listed or proposed for
listing on the nationwide priorities list established under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended
("CERCLA") or any similar state list or to any location to which the
transportation (directly or indirectly) of any Hazardous Materials violates
any Environmental Law of any foreign state or jurisdiction; and   (e) no
oral or written notification of a release (as defined in 42 U.S.C. Section
9601) of a Hazardous Materials has been filed by or on behalf of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, and no property now or previously owned or leased
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is listed or proposed for listing
on the nationwide priorities list established promulgated pursuant to
CERCLA.   Section 5.14 Intellectual Property. The Company and
its Subsidiaries own or possess adequate licenses or other valid rights to
use all patents, patent rights, trademarks, trademark rights and proprietary
information used or held for use in connection with their respective
businesses as currently being conducted, except where the failure to own or
possess such licenses and other rights does not have and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,     16   22  a
Company Material Adverse Effect, and there are no pending
proceedings challenging the validity of any of the foregoing which have or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The conduct of the Company\'s and its
Subsidiaries\' respective businesses as currently conducted does not conflict
with any patents, patent rights, licenses, trademarks, trademark rights,
trade names, trade name rights or copyrights of others in any way which has
or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Company\'s knowledge, there is no
material infringement of any proprietary right owned by or licensed by or to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which has or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 5.15 Insurance. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have policies of insurance and bonds of the type and in amounts
which are appropriate for the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
There is no material claim pending under any of such policies or bonds as to
which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of
such policies or bonds, except questioned, denied or disputed claims the
failure to provide coverage for which does not have and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Except as does not have and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect,
(a) all premiums due and payable under all such policies and bonds have been
paid, (b) the Company and its Subsidiaries are otherwise in compliance in all
material respects with the terms of such policies and bonds and (c) the
Company has no knowledge of any threatened termination of, or material
premium increase with respect to, any of such policies.    Section 5.16

or revoked by operation of law or otherwise. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries that is engaged in the Customs Business maintains a licensed

corporate license and employs a licensed person in each Customs broker
district as required under 19 C.F.R. Section 111.19.   (b) The Company and
each of its Subsidiaries that is engaged in the Customs Business has complied
in all respects with 19 U.S.C. Section 1641 and 19 C.F.R. Part III.   (c)

a whole, is conducted.   Section 5.24 Amendment to the Company Rights
Agreement. The Company has amended or taken other action under the Company
Rights Agreement so that none of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Stock Option Agreements or the Stockholder Agreements, or the
conversion of shares of Company Common Stock into the right to receive shares
of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Article 4 of this Agreement, the
issuance of shares of Company Common Stock upon exercise of the option
granted to Parent pursuant to the applicable Stock Option Agreement, and the
consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby or
by the Stock Option Agreement or the Stockholder Agreements, will cause (i)
the Company Rights to become exercisable under the Company Rights Agreement,
(ii) Parent or any of its shareholders or Subsidiaries to be deemed an
"Acquiring Person" (as defined in the Company Rights Agreement), (iii) any
such event to be an event described in Sections 11(a)(ii) or 13 of the
Company Rights Agreement or (iv) the "Shares Acquisition Date" or the
"Distribution Date" (each as defined in the Company Rights Agreement) to
occur upon any such event, and so that the Company Rights will expire
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company has delivered to Parent
a true and complete copy of the Company Rights Agreement, as amended
to date.     19   25   ARTICLE 6   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
OF  PARENT AND MERGER SUB   Except as set forth in the disclosure letter
delivered to the Company concurrently with the execution hereof (the "Parent
Disclosure Letter"), Parent and Merger Sub, jointly and severally, represent
and warrant to the Company that:   Section 6.1 Existence; Good Standing;
Corporate Authority. Parent and Merger Sub are corporations duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of their
respective jurisdictions of incorporation. Parent is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of
any jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by
it therein or in which the transaction of its business makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified does not
have and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 10.9).
Parent has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and
lease its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted, except
where the failure to possess such power and authority does not have and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The copies of Parent\'s articles of
incorporation and bylaws previously made available to the Company are true
and correct and contain all amendments as of the date hereof.   Section 6.2
Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, the Stock Option Agreements, the Stockholder Agreement to
which it is a party and all other agreements and documents contemplated
hereby and thereby. The consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the Stock Option Agreements has been
duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on behalf of the Company,
other than the approvals referred to in Section 6.22. This Agreement, the
Stockholder Agreement to which it is a party and the Stock Option
Agreements constitute the valid and legally binding obligations of each of
Parent and Merger Sub to the extent it is a party, enforceable in accordance
with their respective terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. Parent
has taken all action necessary to render the restrictions set forth in Part
Thirteen of the Texas Business Corporation Act inapplicable to the Merger,
this Agreement, the Stock Option Agreements, the Stockholder Agreements and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. No other U.S. or State
takeover or business combination statute to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject applies or purports to apply to the Merger, this
Agreement, the Stock Option Agreements, the Stockholder Agreements or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. There is no foreign takeover or
business combination statute that applies or purports to apply to Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries which would require any filing or the taking of any
other action by Parent or its Subsidiaries as a result of the execution or
delivery of this Agreement, the Stock Option Agreements, the Stockholder
Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and which would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect if such filing was not made or such action was not
taken.     20   26   Section 6.3 Capitalization. The authorized
capital stock of Parent consists of 100,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock
and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Parent ("Parent Preferred Stock"), and as of June 23, 2000, there were
28,573,881 shares of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding and 4,638,547
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding Parent
options and no shares of Parent Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. All
such issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights. The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the
Merger, when issued in accordance with this Agreement, will be validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable. As of the date of this Agreement,
except as set forth in this Section 6.3 or in the Stock Option Agreements and
except for any shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to Parent
options outstanding as of June 23, 2000 or thereafter granted as permitted by
this Agreement, there are no outstanding shares of capital stock and there
are no options, warrants, calls, subscriptions, convertible securities or
other rights, agreements or commitments which obligate Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent has
no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of
which have the right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable
for securities having the right to vote) with the shareholders of Parent on
any matter.   Section 6.4 Subsidiaries.   (a) Each of Parent\'s
Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or
other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (where
applicable) under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization, has the corporate or partnership power and authority to own,
operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
(where applicable) in each jurisdiction in which the ownership, operation or
lease of its property or the conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except for jurisdictions in which such failure to be so
qualified or to be in good standing (where applicable) does not have and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of, or other ownership interests in, each of Parent\'s Subsidiaries is
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and is owned,
directly or indirectly, by Parent free and clear of all Liens, except such
Liens as do not have and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries own any shares of capital stock or other
ownership interests in any corporation, partnership, limited liability
company or other entity, except for shares of capital stock or other
ownership interests in Parent\'s Subsidiaries.   (b) All of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of Merger Sub are owned directly by Parent. Merger
Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated hereby and has not engaged in any activities other than in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   Section
6.5 No Violation of Law. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
violation of any order of any court, governmental authority or arbitration
board or tribunal, or any    21   27  law, ordinance, governmental rule
or regulation, U.S. or foreign, to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective properties or assets is subject (including, without
limitation, the Specified Governmental Regulations), except (1) as does not
have and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, or (2) as pertains to laws,
ordinances, governmental rules or regulations, U.S. or foreign, relating to
taxes paid or payable by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to
any of their respective properties or assets, which matters are addressed in
Section 6.10 hereof. Parent and its Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses,
variances, exemptions, orders, franchises and approvals of all governmental
authorities necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses
(the "Parent Permits"), except where the failure so to hold does not have and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance
with the terms of the Parent Permits, except where the failure so to comply
does not have and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of
Parent, no investigation by any governmental authority with respect to Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or threatened, other than those the
outcome of which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   Section 6.6 No
Conflict.   (a) Neither the execution and delivery by Parent or Merger Sub
of this Agreement nor the execution and delivery by Parent of the Stock
Option Agreements nor the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in accordance with the terms
hereof or thereof will: (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any
provisions of the articles or certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
Parent or Merger Sub; (ii) violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach
of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the
termination or in a right of termination or cancellation of, or give rise to
a right of purchase under, or accelerate the performance required by, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties of Parent or
its Subsidiaries under, or result in being declared void, voidable, or
without further binding effect, or otherwise result in a detriment to Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions
of, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise,
permit (including, without limitation, any Parent Permit), lease, contract,
agreement, joint venture, sponsor agreement or other instrument or obligation
to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their properties is bound or affected; or
(iii) contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision
of any law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree binding upon or
applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such matters
described in clause (ii) or (iii) as do not and are not likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (b)
Neither the execution and delivery by Parent or Merger Sub of this Agreement
nor the execution and delivery by Parent of the Stock Option Agreements or
the Stockholder Agreement to which it is a party nor the consummation by
Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in
accordance with the terms hereof or thereof will require any
consent, approval or authorization of, or filing or registration with, any
governmental or regulatory     22   28  authority, U.S. or foreign
(including, without limitation, under the Specified Governmental
Regulations), other than Regulatory Filings and listing on the Nasdaq
National Market of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in
the Merger and the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued upon exercise
of the option granted to the Company pursuant to the applicable Stock Option
Agreement.   Section 6.7 SEC Documents. Parent has made available to
the Company each registration statement, report, proxy statement or
information statement (other than preliminary materials) filed by Parent with
the SEC since September 30, 1999, each in the form (including exhibits and
any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC (collectively, the "Parent
Reports"). As of their respective dates, the Parent Reports (i) were prepared
in all material respects in accordance with the applicable requirements of
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, except for such statements, if any, as have been
modified by subsequent filings with the SEC prior to the date hereof. Each of
the consolidated balance sheets of Parent included in or incorporated by
reference into the Parent Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position
of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated
statements of income, cash flows and shareholders\' equity of Parent included
in or incorporated by reference into the Parent Reports (including any
related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the
results of operations, cash flows or changes in shareholders\' equity, as the
case may be, of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to (x) such exceptions as may
be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and (y) normal year-end audit
adjustments), in each case in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be
noted therein. Except as reflected in such financial statements, including
all notes thereto, and except for liabilities incurred in connection with
this Agreement, the Stock Option Agreements or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise), other than (i) liabilities and
obligations arising in the ordinary course of business since the date of such
financial statements and (ii) liabilities or obligations which do not have
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate (together with those described in clause (i)), a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 6.8 Litigation; Decrees. There are no actions,
suits or proceedings pending against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or, to
Parent\'s knowledge, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, at
law or in equity, or before or by any federal, state or foreign commission,
board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, that have had or would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. There are no outstanding judgments, decrees, injunctions,
awards or orders against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that have had or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Except for such matters as do not and are not
likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (i) no order, writ, fine,
injunction, decree, judgment, award or determination of any court or
governmental authority has been issued or entered against Parent
or       23   29  any Subsidiary of the Parent that continues to be
in effect that affects the ownership or operation of any of their respective
assets, and (ii) no criminal order, writ, fine, injunction, decree, judgment
or determination of any court or governmental authority has been issued
against Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent.   Section 6.9 Absence of
Certain Changes. From March 31, 2000 through the date of this Agreement,
there has not been (i) any event or occurrence that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, (ii) any material change by Parent in its accounting
methods, principles or practices or its tax methods, practices or elections,
(iii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or
distribution in respect of any capital stock of Parent or any redemption,
purchase or other acquisition of any of its securities or (iv) any increase
in or establishment of any bonus, insurance, severance,
deferred compensation, pension, retirement, profit sharing, stock option,
stock purchase or other employee benefit plan, except in the ordinary course
of business.   Section 6.10 Taxes.   (a) Each of Parent, its Subsidiaries
and each affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group of
which any such corporation is or was a member has (i) duly filed (or there
has been filed on its behalf) on a timely basis with appropriate governmental
authorities all tax returns, statements, reports, declarations, estimates and
forms required to be filed by or with respect to it on or prior to the date
hereof, except to the extent that any failure to file does not have and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, and (ii) duly paid or deposited in full on a
timely basis or made adequate provisions in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles (or there has been paid or deposited or
adequate provision has been made on its behalf) for the payment of all taxes
required to be paid by it for all periods ended through the date hereof,
except to the extent that any failure to pay or deposit or make
adequate provision for the payment of such taxes does not have and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.   (b) (i) The federal income tax returns of Parent
and each of its Subsidiaries have been examined by the IRS (or the applicable
statutes of limitation for the assessment of federal income taxes for such
periods have expired) for all periods; (ii) except to the extent being
contested in good faith, all deficiencies asserted in writing as a result of
such examinations and any other examinations of Parent and its Subsidiaries
by any taxing authority have been paid, fully settled or adequately provided
for in the financial statements contained in the Parent Reports, except for
deficiencies that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect; (iii)
except as adequately provided for in the Parent Reports, no material federal,
state, local or foreign income or franchise tax audits or other
administrative proceedings or court proceedings are presently pending with
regard to any federal, state, local or foreign income or franchise taxes
regarding Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and no material deficiency for
any such income or franchise taxes has been asserted or assessed in writing
pursuant to such examination against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries by any
federal, state, local or foreign taxing authority with respect to any period;
(iv) as of the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
granted in writing any requests, agreements, consents or waivers (that
remain     24   30  in effect) to extend the statutory period of
limitations applicable to the assessment of any taxes with respect to any tax
returns of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; and (v) neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries is a party to, is bound by or has any obligation under
any tax sharing or similar agreement (other than agreements between Parent
and its Subsidiaries).   (c) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
executed or entered into (or prior to the close of business on the Closing
Date will execute or enter into) with the IRS or any other taxing authority
any material closing agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code, or any
predecessor provision thereof or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign income tax law that relates to the assets or operations of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries that would require payment of taxes after the Closing
Date.   (d) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has made an election
under Section 341(f) of the Code or agreed to have Section 341(f)(2) of the
Code apply to any disposition of a subsection (f) asset (as such term
is defined in Section 341(f)(4) of the Code) owned by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries.   (e) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has been
a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of
Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable period specified in
Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.   Section 6.11 Employee Benefit
Plans. For purposes of this Section 6.11, all references to "Parent" shall be
deemed to refer to Parent and any trade or business, whether or not
incorporated, that together with Parent would be (or, during the six years
prior to the date of this Agreement, has been) deemed or treated as a "single
employer" within the meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA, or Code Section 414.
Schedule 6.11 of the Parent Disclosure Letter contains a list of all employee
benefit plans and other benefit arrangements, including any stock purchase,
stock option, pension, profit-sharing, retirement, bonus, deferred
compensation, incentive compensation, commission, severance or termination
pay, hospitalization, medical, dental, disability, life or other insurance,
or supplemental unemployment benefits plan, policy, contract, practice or
other arrangement, whether or not subject to ERISA or U.S. based and whether
written or oral, that is, or within the six year period preceding the date
hereof has been, sponsored, maintained or contributed to or required to
be contributed to by Parent for the purpose of providing service-
or employment-related compensation or benefits to any current or former
officer, director, employee, retiree or independent contractor of Parent or
members of their respective families (other than directors\' and officers\'
liability policies), whether or not insured, including, without limitation,
benefits that are required to be provided under applicable law (the "Parent
Benefit Plans"). True and complete copies of the Parent Benefit Plans and, if
applicable, the most recent Form 5500, IRS determination letter, actuarial
report, summary plan description, trust or other funding agreement and annual
report for each such plan have been made available to the Company. Parent has
no commitment or obligation to establish or adopt any new or additional plans
or other arrangements that would constitute Parent Benefit Plans if adopted,
or to increase materially the benefits under any existing Parent Benefit
Plan. All applicable reporting and disclosure requirements have been met with
respect to the Parent Benefit Plans except for any noncompliance that does
not have and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse     25   31  Effect. To the
extent applicable, the Parent Benefit Plans comply, and have been operated in
compliance, in all material respects, with the requirements of all applicable
laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, ERISA and the
Code and the requirements of any applicable jurisdiction. With respect to any
Parent Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
(i) such plan has received a determination letter from the IRS stating
that it is so qualified and, to Parent\'s knowledge, no event has occurred
since the date of such letter that would adversely affect such determination
or (ii) the remedial amendment period under Code Section 401(b) for such plan
has not expired. The Parent Benefit Plans have been maintained and operated,
in all material respects, in accordance with their terms. To Parent\'s
knowledge, there are no pending or anticipated claims against or otherwise
involving any Parent Benefit Plan and no suit, action or other litigation
(excluding claims for benefits incurred in the ordinary course of Parent
Benefit Plan activities) has been brought against or with respect to any such
Parent Benefit Plan, except for any of the foregoing which does not have and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. All material contributions required to be
made as of the date hereof to Parent Benefit Plans have been made. Neither
Parent nor any Parent Benefit Plan provides for medical, life insurance or
health benefits or other welfare benefits after a Parent employee\'s
termination of employment (including retirement) except for continuation
coverage required pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Title I
of ERISA and the regulations thereunder or coverage mandated by applicable
law outside the U.S., and Parent has not represented, promised or contracted
(whether in oral or written form) to any employee or former employee that
such benefits would be provided. No Parent Benefit Plan is a voluntary
employee\'s beneficiary association within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9)
of the Code. With respect to each Parent Benefit Plan, the present value of
accrued benefits under such plan did not exceed, as of its latest valuation
date, the then current value of the assets of such plan allocable to such
accrued benefits or, to the extent the amount by which the present value of
accrued benefits exceeds the current value of plan assets, the financial
statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries made available to the Company
fairly reflect such liabilities in the aggregate. To the Parent\'s knowledge,
no prohibited transaction has occurred with respect to any Parent Benefit
Plan that would result in the imposition of any excise tax or other liability
under the Code or ERISA. Parent does not contribute to, and has no obligation
to contribute to, and has not within six years prior to the Effective Time
contributed to, or had an obligation to contribute to, a multiemployer
plan within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA or any "employee pension
benefit plan," as defined Section 3(2) of ERISA, that is subject to the
funding requirements of Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Parent
has no actual or contingent obligation to make any payments that would be
"excess parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code. Neither the
execution of this Agreement nor the performance of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (either alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under any policy,
arrangement, agreement or benefit plan, or any trust or loan, that will or
may result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise),
acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in
benefits or other compensation or obligations to fund benefits with respect
to any employee or former employee of Parent.   Section 6.12 Labor Matters.
Except as does not have and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (i)
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or bound by any
collective bargaining agreement,      26   32  contract or other
agreement with a labor union or labor organization, U.S. or foreign, and (ii)
to Parent\'s knowledge, there are no organizational efforts with respect to
the formation of a collective bargaining unit presently being made or
threatened involving employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.  
Section 6.13 Environmental Matters. Except as does not have and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect:   (a) there are not any past or present conditions
or circumstances relating to any Hazardous Material that interfere with the
conduct of the business of Parent and each of its Subsidiaries in the manner
now conducted or which interfere with compliance with any order of any court,
governmental authority or arbitration board or tribunal, or any Environmental
Law;   (b) there are not any past or present conditions or
circumstances at, or arising out of, any current or former businesses, assets
or properties of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, including but not
limited to on-site or off-site disposal or release of any Hazardous Material,
which would reasonably be expected to give rise to: (i) liabilities or
obligations for any Cleanup under any Environmental Law, (ii) any fines or
penalties or (iii) claims arising for personal injury, property damage or
damage to natural resources;   (c) neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has (i) given or received any written notice of noncompliance
with, violation of, or liability or potential liability under any
Environmental Law or (ii) entered into any consent decree or order or is
subject to any order of any court or governmental authority or tribunal under
any Environmental Law or relating to the Cleanup of any Hazardous
Materials;   (d) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries have
transported or arranged for the transportation (directly or indirectly) of
any Hazardous Materials to any location which is listed or proposed for
listing on the nationwide priorities list established under the Comprehensive

consultation with its outside legal counsel the failure to so withdraw,
modify or change its recommendation and declaration or to so recommend and
declare advisable any Company Superior Proposal or Parent Superior

third parties. The parties hereto will make reasonable and appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. Each of Parent and the Company
agrees that it will not, and will cause its respective representatives not

Merger, a portion of which Registration Statement shall also serve as the
joint proxy statement with respect to the meetings of the shareholders of
Parent and of the stockholders of the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Proxy
Statement/Prospectus"). The respective parties will cause the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 to comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts, and the Company will cooperate with Parent,

practicable. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain,
prior to the effective date of the Form S-4, all necessary foreign, state
securities law or "Blue Sky" permits or approvals required to carry out the

provided by it for inclusion in the Form S-4 or any amendment or supplement
thereto, at the time it is filed or becomes effective, (i) will not include
an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and
(ii) will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.   Section 7.10 Listing Application.
Parent shall promptly prepare and submit to the Nasdaq National Market a

Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall each cause to be prepared and
delivered to the other a list identifying all persons who, at the time of the
meetings of stockholders and shareholders pursuant to Section 7.5, the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, believes may be deemed to be
"affiliates" of the Company or Parent, as that term is used in paragraphs (c)
and (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (the "Rule 145 Affiliates").
Parent shall be entitled to place restrictive legends on any shares of Parent
Common Stock received by such Rule 145 Affiliates pursuant to the Merger. The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each person
who is identified as a Rule 145 Affiliate in such list to deliver to Parent,
at or prior to the Effective Time, a written agreement, in the form to be
approved by the parties hereto, that such Rule 145 Affiliate will not sell,
pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of Parent Common Stock
issued to such Rule 145 Affiliate pursuant to the Merger, except pursuant to
an effective registration statement or in compliance with Rule 145 or an
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The
Company and Parent shall each use its best efforts to cause each person who
is identified as a Rule 145 Affiliate in such list, to sign as soon as
possible after the date hereof, but in any event on or prior to the thirtieth
day prior to the Effective Time a written agreement, in the form to
be approved by the Company and Parent that such party will not sell or in any
other way reduce such party\'s risk relative to any shares of Parent Common
Stock or Company Common Stock (within the meaning of Section 201.01 of the
SEC\'s Financial Reporting Release No. 1), until such time as financial
results (including combined sales and net income) covering at least 30 days
of post-merger operations have been published, except as permitted by
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 76 (or any successor thereto) issued by the
SEC.     41  47    Section 7.13 Expenses. Whether or not the Merger is
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses, except (a) that all expenses incurred in connection
with the printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form
S-4, as well as the filing fees related thereto, shall be shared equally by
the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, and (b) as
expressly provided herein or as otherwise agreed in writing by the
parties.   Section 7.14 Indemnification and Insurance.   (a) From and
after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
date hereof, an officer or director of the Company (or any Subsidiary or
division thereof) and each person who served at the request of the Company as
a director, officer, trustee or fiduciary of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise (individually, an "Indemnified Party" and,
collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs or expenses (including attorneys\' fees), judgments,
fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or pertaining to
acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by them in their capacities
as such, whether commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the Effective
Time. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (an "Action"), (i) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
pay, as incurred, the fees and expenses of counsel selected by the
Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent and
the Surviving Corporation, in advance of the final disposition of any such
Action to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and upon receipt of
any undertaking required by applicable law, and (ii) Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided,
however, that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable
for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and provided further that
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated pursuant to this
Section 7.14 to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel for
all Indemnified Parties in any single Action, unless, in the good faith
judgment of any of the Indemnified Parties, there is or may be a conflict of
interests between two or more of such Indemnified Parties, in which case
there may be separate counsel for each similarly situated group.   (b) The
parties agree that the rights to indemnification, including provisions
relating to advances of expenses incurred in defense of any Action, in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to matters occurring through the Effective Time, shall survive
the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six
years from the Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights
to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted within such
period shall continue until the disposition or resolution of such Action.  
(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained officers\' and
directors\' liability insurance covering the Indemnified Parties who now are,
or at any time prior to the date hereof were, covered by the     42 
48   Company\'s existing officers\' and directors\' liability insurance
policies on terms substantially no less advantageous to the Indemnified
Parties than such existing insurance; provided that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of
the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof (the
amount of which premium is set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter), but
in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for
such amount.   (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be
in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, under the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this Section
7.14 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended
to benefit each of the Indemnified Parties.   (e) In the event Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section
7.14.   Section 7.15 Certain Benefits.   (a) At the Effective Time, Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to continue the
employment of all of the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
initially at the same salaries and wages of such employees immediately prior
to the Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement shall be considered a
contract between Parent, the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries and any
employee or consideration for, or inducement with respect to, any employee\'s
continued employment and, without limitation, all such employees are and will
continue to be considered to be employees at will pursuant to the applicable
employment at will laws or doctrines, subject to any express written
agreement to the contrary with such employee, and the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries will have the right, in their discretion and subject to
this Section 7.15, to alter the salaries, wages and terms of employment of
such employees after the Effective Time.   (b) With respect to each Affected
Employee, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to deem the period of
employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries to have been employment and
service with Parent for purposes of determining the Affected Employee\'s
eligibility to join and vesting (but not benefit accrual) under all employee
benefit plans, programs, policies or similar employment related arrangements
to the extent service with Parent is recognized thereunder. Parent shall
waive, and to the extent necessary to effect the terms hereof, shall use its
best efforts to cause the relevant insurance carriers and other third parties
to waive, any restrictions and limitations for medical conditions existing as
of the Effective Time of those Affected Employees and their dependents who
were covered immediately prior to the Effective Time under a group health
plan maintained by the Company, but only to the extent that such medical
condition would be covered by Parent\'s or the Surviving Corporation\'s group
health plan if it were not a pre-existing condition     43  49   and
only to the extent that such limitations would not have applied under
the Company\'s group health plan prior to the Effective Time. Further, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to offer at the Effective Time to each
Affected Employee coverage under a group health plan (as defined in Section
5000(b)(1) of the Code) which credits such Affected Employee towards the
deductibles, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions imposed under
such group health plan, for the year during which the Effective Time occurs,
with any applicable expenses already incurred during such year under the
Company\'s group health plan.   (c) Effective on or before January 1, 2002,
Parent agrees to extend to the employees of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries who are based in the United States eligibility for the employee
benefit plans and programs available to similarly situated employees of
Parent.   (d) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the
date hereof, use its best efforts to clarify or amend the Sharesave Scheme
2000 or take other actions requested by Parent so that, on and after the
Effective Time, no shares of Company Common Stock will be issued or issuable
under such scheme.   Section 7.16 Reorganization; Pooling.   (a) From and
after the date hereof and until the Effective Time, none of Parent, the
Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall knowingly take any
action, or fail to take any reasonable action, as a result of which
the Merger would fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code (and any comparable provisions of applicable state
or local law) or enter into any contract, agreement, commitment or
arrangement to take or fail to take any such action.   (b) From and after
the date hereof and until the Effective Time, none of the Company, Parent or
any of their respective Subsidiaries shall knowingly take any action, or fail
to take any reasonable action, that would prevent the treatment of the Merger
as a "pooling of interests" for financial accounting purposes or enter into
any contract, agreement, commitment or arrangement to take or fail to take
any such action. Each of the parties shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the letter from its independent public accountant referred
to in Sections 8.2(c) and 8.3(c).   (c) Following the Effective Time,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall knowingly take any action or
knowingly cause any action to be taken which would cause the Merger to fail
to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code (and any comparable provisions of applicable state or local law).  
Section 7.17 Rights Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall take any action (including, if
necessary, amending or terminating (but with respect to termination, only as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time) the Rights Agreement) necessary
so that none of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Stock
Option Agreements, the Stockholder Agreements, the conversion of shares of
Company Common Stock into     44  50   the right to receive shares of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with Article 4 of this Agreement, the
issuance of Company Common Stock upon exercise of the option granted to
Parent pursuant to the applicable Stock Option Agreement, the consummation of
the Merger, or any other transaction contemplated hereby, by the Stock Option
Agreements or by the Stockholder Agreements will cause (i) the Company Rights
to become exercisable under the Company Rights Agreement, (ii) Parent or any
of its shareholders or Subsidiaries to be deemed an "Acquiring Person" (as
defined in the Company Rights Agreement), (iii) any such event to be an event
described in Section 11(a)(ii) or 13 of the Company Rights Agreement or (iv)
the "Shares Acquisition Date" or the "Distribution Date" (each as defined in
the Company Rights Agreement) to occur upon any such event, and so that
the Company Rights will expire immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor the Company shall take any
other action to (a) terminate the Company Rights Agreement, (b) redeem the
Company Rights, (c) amend the Company Rights Agreement in a manner adverse to
Parent, or (d) cause any person not to be or become an "Acquiring
Person."   Section 7.18 Agreement with Employees. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall use its best efforts to enter into employment
agreements with key individuals identified by Parent. The employment

at the Effective Time.   ARTICLE 8   CONDITIONS   Section 8.1 Conditions

provision of this Agreement shall be binding upon any party hereto unless

other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which such

59    Section 10.10 Waivers. Except as provided in this Agreement, no
action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation,
any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute
a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision
hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or
subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder.   Section
10.11 Incorporation of Disclosure Letters. The Company Disclosure Letter and
the Parent Disclosure Letter are hereby incorporated herein and made a part
hereof for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.   Section 10.12
Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.   Section 10.13
Enforcement of Agreement. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.   Section 10.14 Obligation of Parent. Whenever this Agreement
requires Merger Sub (or its successors) to take any action, such requirement
shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause
Merger Sub to take such action and a guarantee of the performance
thereof.     54  60    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed
this Agreement and caused the same to be duly delivered on their behalf on
the day and year first written above.    EGL, INC.     By: /s/ Elijio
