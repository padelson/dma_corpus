Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by Merger Sub and the

with the DGCL (the time the Merger becomes effective being hereinafter

Time,   

(a) the certificate of incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately

(b) the parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that the by-laws of

each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and

ARTICLE III    

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES    

SECTION 3.01 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or
the holders of any of the following securities:   

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Share (other than any Shares
to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.01(b)_ and any Dissenting Shares
(collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ")) will be cancelled and converted
automatically into the right to receive $14.75 in cash (the " _Merger
Consideration_ ") payable, without interest, to the holder of such Share,
upon surrender, in the manner provided in _Section 3.02_, of the Certificate
that formerly evidenced such Share or the Book-Entry Share.   

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each Share held
in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or
any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent will be cancelled
automatically without any conversion thereof and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.   

(c) _Equity Interests of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.   

SECTION 3.02 _Surrender of Certificates_.   

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i)
certificates representing Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or (ii) Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ").   

(b) _Payment Fund_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to
be deposited with the Paying Agent, pursuant to an agreement providing for
the matters set forth in this _Section 3.02_ and such other matters as may
be appropriate and the terms of which shall be reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Company, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)_
(the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying
Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that, such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or bankers
acceptances of, repurchase or reverse repurchase contracts with, or
Eurodollar time deposits purchased from, commercial banks with capital,
surplus and undivided profits aggregating in excess of $1 billion (based on
the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly
available). If for any reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is
inadequate to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be
paid pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)_, Parent shall promptly deposit or cause
to be deposited additional cash with the Paying Agent in an amount sufficient
to make all payments of Merger Consideration, and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall in any event be liable for payment thereof. Except as
contemplated by _Section 3.02(e)_, the Payment Fund will not be used for any
other purpose.   

(c) _Exchange of Certificates_. Within five (5) Business Days after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be delivered to each
(i) record holder, as of the Effective Time, of an outstanding Certificate or
(ii) holder, as of the Effective Time, of Book-Entry Shares, a form of letter
of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and agreed to by Parent and
the Company prior to the Effective Time, and shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the duly executed letter of transmittal, such other documents as may
customarily be required by the Paying Agent and, as applicable, any
Certificates to the Paying Agent). Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of
a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for cancellation, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required
by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall then be cancelled. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares on any amounts payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or the
transferred Book-Entry Share is registered if (x) either the Certificate
representing such Shares is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form
for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and (y)
the Person requesting such payment (1) has paid all transfer and other Taxes
required by reason of such transfer or (2) established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes either have been paid or are
not applicable. Until surrendered for cancellation as contemplated by this
_Section 3.02(c)_ , each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be
deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration to which the holder of
such Certificate or such Book-Entry Share is entitled pursuant to this 
_Article III_.   

(d) _No Further Rights_. From and after the Effective Time, holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights as
stockholders of the Company, except as provided in this Agreement or by
applicable Law.   

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Six months after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to deliver to Parent, upon demand, any
portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of
Shares at such time, and any holders of Shares who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation and/or Parent for, and the Surviving Corporation and/or
Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration. Any portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed by holders
of Shares as of a date that is immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or other
Encumbrance of any Person previously entitled thereto.   

(f) _No Liability_. None of the Paying Agent, Merger Sub, the Company, Parent
or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares or any
other Person for any Merger Consideration (or dividends or distributions with
respect thereto), cash or other consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or other Law.   

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable or deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment or
delivery under all applicable Laws, provided that all withheld amounts are
timely remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, and timely remitted to the applicable
Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.   

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in respect of such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof
is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)_.   

(i) _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. If at any time during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company
changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number or class of
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective
Time as a result of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares,
stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect
to the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, then the
Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may
be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.   

SECTION 3.03 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of
the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to
the shares evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. On and after the
Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent for any reason shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to 
_Section 3.01(a)_.   

SECTION 3.04 _Company Equity Awards_.   

(a) Each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each,
a " _Company Stock Award_ ") granted under the Companys 1993 Stock Option
Plan, Non-Qualified Formula Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors,
1995 Flexible Incentive Plan, 2002 Employee/Rainforest Conversion Plan and
2003 Equity Incentive Plan or granted outside of a formal plan, in each case
as amended through the date of this Agreement (collectively, the " _Company
Stock Award Plans_ ") shall, except as otherwise provided by the terms of any
Company Stock Award Plan, become fully vested, to the extent not already
vested, subject to, and conditioned upon, the closing of the Merger and, to
the extent outstanding and unexercised at the Effective Time, shall be
cancelled at the Effective Time (the " _Award Cancellation_ ") and the holder
of each such cancelled Company Stock Award shall be entitled to receive an
amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding Taxes) equal to the
product of (i) the excess, if any, of (1) the Merger Consideration, over
(2) the applicable exercise price per share of such cancelled Company Stock
Award, and (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such cancelled Company Stock Award (the " _Award Payment_ ").
Except as otherwise expressly provided for in any agreement between the
Company and any such holder, the Surviving Corporation shall make, or shall
cause the Paying Agent to make (in which case it shall deposit with the
Paying Agent an amount in cash equal to the aggregate Award Payments to be
paid by the Paying Agent), the Award Payments promptly after the Effective
Time, but in no event more than ten (10) Business Days following the Effective
Time. Any such Award Payments shall be subject to all applicable federal,
state and local Tax withholding requirements.   

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, to the extent required by
the Company Stock Award Plan, deliver prior written notice (the " _Award
Cancellation Notice_ ") to the holders of Company Stock Awards of (i) any
right of such holders, arising as a result of the Merger, to exercise the
Company Stock Awards prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the
Award Cancellation contemplated by _Section 3.04(a)_. The Company shall
promptly deliver to Parent, but in no event later than the Effective Time,
true and complete copies of the Award Cancellation Notice required to be
delivered pursuant to this _Section 3.04(b)_.   

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action
to approve the disposition of the Company Stock Awards in connection with the
Transactions by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "
_Exchange Act_ "), with respect to the Company to the extent necessary
to exempt such dispositions under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act.   

SECTION 3.05 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under the DGCL,
any Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares of Company Common Stock cancelled in accordance with _Section
3.01(b)_) that are held by a stockholder (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who
has (a) neither voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
nor consented thereto in writing, (b) demanded properly in writing appraisal
for such Shares and (c) otherwise properly perfected and not withdrawn or
lost his or her rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such
shares being referred to collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until
such time as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such
holders appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares), will
not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration. Each Dissenting Stockholder will be entitled to receive
payment of the appraised value of the Dissenting Shares held by it
in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262; _provided_ , that if a
Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such Dissenting
Stockholders right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such Dissenting
Stockholder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL,
such Dissenting Shares held by such Dissenting Stockholder will thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into, and represent the right to receive, the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, in the manner provided in
_Article III_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to applicable Laws received by the Company
relating to stockholders rights of appraisal. The Company shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, unless otherwise required by applicable Law,
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of Dissenting
Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal
or other treatment of any such demands.   

SECTION 3.06 _Timing of Equity Rollover_. For the avoidance of doubt, the
parties acknowledge and agree that the contribution of Shares and cash to
Parent pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter will be deemed to occur
immediately prior to the Effective Time and prior to any other event
described above.

(collectively, the " _Transactions_ "). The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions,
other than, with respect to the Merger, the adoption of this Agreement by
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
entitled to vote thereon (the " _Requisite Stockholder Vote_ ") and the
filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the
DGCL. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger
Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except to the
extent that enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, reorganization or other
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and by
principles of equity regarding the availability of remedies (regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law).   

(b) The Board, acting upon the unanimous recommendation of the Special
Committee, by resolutions duly adopted by unanimous vote (other than Fertitta
who abstained) at a meeting duly called and held (the " _Company Board
Approval_ "), has duly (i) determined that this Agreement and the
Transactions are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company
and its stockholders (other than Parent, Merger Sub, Fertitta and their
respective Affiliates), (ii) approved this Agreement and the Transactions and
(iii) recommended that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement
(the " _Board Recommendation_ ") and directed that this Agreement and the
Merger be submitted for consideration by the Companys stockholders in
accordance with this Agreement.   

(c) No "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other
similar anti-takeover Law (each, a " _Takeover Law_ ") is applicable to the
Transactions. The adoption of this Agreement by the Requisite Stockholder
Vote is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of Equity
Interests of the Company necessary to adopt this Agreement or approve the
Transactions under the DGCL and the Companys organizational documents.   

(d) The Special Committee has received the opinion of Moelis and Company LLC,
dated the date, or shortly prior to the date, of this Agreement, to the
effect that, as of the date of such opinion, the consideration to be received
by the holders of the Shares is fair, from a financial point of view, to the
stockholders of the Company (other than Parent, Merger Sub, Fertitta and
their respective Affiliates), a copy of which opinion has been delivered to
Parent.   

SECTION 4.05 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.   

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the consummation of the Transactions will not,   

(i) conflict with or violate the organizational documents of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries,   

(ii) assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and other actions
described in  _Section 4.05(b)_ have been obtained and all filings and
notifications described in  _Section 4.05(b)_ have been made, conflict with
or violate any Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by
which any property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound or   

(iii) require the consent of any Person under, or result in any breach or
violation of or constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse
of time or both, would become a default) under, any Contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any property or asset of the Company or any of

connection with the filing of the Preliminary Proxy Statement and the Proxy
Statement, the Company, in cooperation with and subject to the approval of
the Special Committee if then in existence or otherwise by resolution of a
majority of Disinterested Directors, and Parent shall cooperate to: (i)
concurrently with the preparation and filing of the Preliminary Proxy

supplements to the Schedule 13E-3 will be made by Parent without prior
consultation with the Special Committee if then in existence or otherwise the
Disinterested Directors.   

(b) The Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law, notify Parent

stockholders (the " _Special Meeting_ ") for the purposes of considering
and taking action upon the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
Merger, including adjourning such meeting for up to ten (10) Business Days to
obtain such approval _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall be
permitted to cancel, delay or postpone convening the Special Meeting to the
extent the Special Committee if then in existence or otherwise by
resolution of a majority of Disinterested Directors, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, determines that such cancellation, delay or
postponement is consistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law
(any such cancellation, delay or postponement being hereinafter referred to as
a " _Special Meeting Delay_ "). Unless the Board or Special Committee, as
applicable, has withdrawn or modified its approval or recommendation of this
Agreement as expressly permitted by  _Section 7.03_, the Company, acting
through the Special Committee if then in existence or otherwise by resolution
of a majority of Disinterested Directors, shall (i) use
commercially reasonable efforts to solicit the approval and adoption of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, including the approval and
adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the then-

its Subsidiaries) (the " _Majority of the Minority Vote_ ") and (ii) include
in the Proxy Statement (A) the Special Committees and the Boards
declaration of the fairness and advisability of this Agreement and the

the Representatives of Parent and Merger Sub reasonable access at all
reasonable times to the officers, employees, properties, offices and other
facilities, books and records of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries,
and shall furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such financial, operating and
other data and information as Parent or Merger Sub, through its officers,
employees or agents, may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to disclose any
information that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, (i) it is not
legally permitted to disclose or the disclosure of which would contravene
any applicable Law or Order, (ii) would be reasonably likely to cause the
loss of any attorney-client or other legal privilege or trade secret
protection held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) would
cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to violate the terms or result in
the breach of any material Contract.   

(b) No investigation pursuant to this _Section 7.02_ or otherwise shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty in this
Agreement of any party hereto.   

SECTION 7.03 _Solicitation_.   

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing
until the later of (x) 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on December 17, 2009
and (y) the consummation of the Debt Financing (the " _Go Shop Period End
Date_ "), the Company may, directly or indirectly, under the direction of the
Special Committee (which has been authorized to act on behalf of the Board
and the Company with respect to any action permitted or contemplated by this
_Section 7.03_): (i) initiate, solicit and encourage Acquisition Proposals,
including by way of public disclosure and by way of providing access to non
public information to any Person pursuant to one or more Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreements; and (ii) enter into and maintain, or participate
in, discussions or negotiations with respect to Acquisition Proposals or
otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any such
inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations or the making of
any Acquisition Proposals.   

(b) Subject to _Section 7.03(c)_, from the Go Shop Period End Date until the
Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article IX_, the Company shall not, and shall use
reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or encourage (including by way of providing
non-public information) the submission of any Acquisition Proposal or engage
in any substantive discussions or negotiations with respect thereto or (ii)
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, an
Acquisition Proposal or enter into any merger agreement, letter of intent,
agreement in principle, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement or
share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement
providing for or relating to an Acquisition Proposal or consummate any such
transaction or enter into any agreement or agreement in principle requiring
the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any of
the other Transactions or resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, acting through the Special
Committee if then in existence or otherwise by resolution of a majority
of Disinterested Directors, may continue to take any of the actions described
in the immediately preceding clause (i) from and after the Go Shop Period End
Date with respect to any Person that has made an Acquisition Proposal prior
to the Go Shop Period End Date and with whom the Company is having ongoing
discussions or negotiations as of the Go Shop Period End Date regarding
an Acquisition Proposal to the extent that the Company satisfies the
requirements of _Section 7.03(c)(ii)_ on the Go Shop Period End Date with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal (each such Person, an " _Excluded Party_
"). Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 7.03_ to the
contrary, an Excluded Party will no longer be an Excluded Party for all
purposes under this Agreement immediately at such time as (x) the Acquisition
Proposal made by such Excluded Party is withdrawn, is terminated, expires or
such Excluded Party fails to satisfy the requirements of _Section 7.03(c)_
or (y) such discussions or negotiations have been terminated. The Company,
acting through the Special Committee if then in existence or otherwise by
resolution of a majority of Disinterested Directors, shall notify Parent
promptly when an Excluded Party ceases to be an Excluded Party. At the Go
Shop Period End Date, other than with respect to Excluded Parties (or with
respect to any Excluded Party, at such subsequent date that such Excluded
Party ceases to be an Excluded Party), the Company shall immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or
negotiation with any Person conducted theretofore by the Company or any of
its Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and use its
(and will cause its Representatives to use their) commercially reasonable
efforts to cause to be returned or destroyed all confidential information
provided or made available to any such Person on behalf of the Company   

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 7.03(b)_,
and in addition to the Companys right under _Section 7.03(a)_, if at any
time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Vote, including the
Majority of the Minority Vote, (i) the Company receives a written Acquisition
Proposal from a third party that the Board, acting through the Special
Committee if then in existence or otherwise by resolution of a majority of
its Disinterested Directors, believes in good faith to be credible and
reasonably capable of making a Superior Proposal and (ii) the Company has not
intentionally or materially breached this  _Section 7.03_, then the Company,
acting through the Special Committee if then in existence or otherwise by
resolution of a majority of Disinterested Directors, may (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company to the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , that the Company shall not, and shall not allow any of
its Representatives to, disclose any material non-public information to such
Person without entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 7.03(b)_ or
this _Section 7.03(c)_, prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Vote,
the Company, acting through the Special Committee if then in existence
or otherwise by resolution of a majority of Disinterested Directors, shall be
permitted to take the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) immediately
above with respect to any Excluded Party until such Excluded Party ceases to
qualify as an Excluded Party under _Section 7.03(b)_.   

(d) Promptly following the Go Shop Period End Date, the Company, acting
through the Special Committee if then in existence or otherwise by resolution
of a majority of Disinterested Directors, shall notify Parent, in writing, of
the identity of each Excluded Party and shall notify Parent of the material
terms and conditions of each written Acquisition Proposal received from any
Excluded Party. From and after the Go Shop Period End Date, the Company,
acting through the Special Committee if then in existence or otherwise by
resolution of a majority of Disinterested Directors, shall (i) notify Parent
promptly in writing if the Company receives or after it becomes aware
that one of its Representatives has received an Acquisition Proposal from a
Person or group of related Persons, including the material terms and
conditions thereof and the identity of the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal, to the extent Known, and (ii) keep Parent reasonably apprised and
update Parent promptly as to the status and any material developments,
discussions and negotiations concerning such Acquisition Proposal. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company, acting through the Special Committee if
then in existence or otherwise by resolution of a majority of Disinterested
Directors, shall inform Parent in writing promptly in the event that it
determines to begin providing information or engaging in discussions or
negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to this _Section
7.03_.   

(e) Neither the Board nor any committee thereof, including the Special
Committee, if then in existence, shall directly or indirectly withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or publicly propose to
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub,
its recommendation in favor of the Merger or any of the other Transactions (a
" _Change of Board Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the immediately
foregoing sentence, the Board, acting through the Special Committee if then
in existence or otherwise by resolution of a majority of its Disinterested
Directors, may, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Vote, including the Majority of the Minority Vote, if it determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisors, that the failure
to take such action could reasonably be determined to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law,
(i) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.01(d)(ii)_ , (ii) cause the Company to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal and concurrently terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)(ii)_ and/or (iii) withdraw or modify
the Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, the
Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)(ii)_
and any purported termination pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)(ii)_ shall be
void and of no force and effect, unless concurrently with such termination
the Company pays to Parent the Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section
9.03_.   

(f) Subject to this _Section 7.03_, the Company shall not terminate, waive,
amend or modify any material provision of any standstill or confidentiality
agreement to which it is a party (including each Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) that relates to a transaction of a type described in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ¸ that the Company
may permit to be taken any of the actions prohibited under a standstill
agreement if the Board, acting through the Special Committee if then in
existence or otherwise by resolution of a majority of its Disinterested
Directors, determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
that such action is advisable.   

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.03_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
prohibits the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) otherwise making any disclosure to its stockholders if
the Board, acting through the Special Committee if then in existence
or otherwise by resolution of a majority of its Disinterested Directors,
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
failure so to disclose could reasonably be determined to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or that such disclosure
is necessary to comply with obligations under federal securities Laws or the
rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange.   

(h) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.03_ prohibits the Company from
responding to any unsolicited proposal or inquiry solely by advising the
Person making such proposal or inquiry of the terms of this _Section
7.03_.   

(i) Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their Affiliates (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries) shall take any action with the purpose of
discouraging in any material way or preventing any Person from making a
competing Acquisition Proposal.   

SECTION 7.04 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.   

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law each present and former director and officer
of the Company (each, together with such Persons heirs, executors or
administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any and all costs,
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, Liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any Action or investigation arising out of, pertaining to or
in connection with any act or omission or matters existing or occurring or
alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, including the
Transactions and any acts or omissions in connection with such Persons
serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if such
service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company. If any such
Action or investigation occurs, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
advance to each Indemnified Party the expenses it incurs in the defense of
any such Action or investigation within ten (10) Business Days of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation receiving from such Indemnified Party a written
request therefor;  _provided_ that (i) any such advancement of expenses will
be only to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and (ii) such
Indemnified Party provides an undertaking to repay such advances to Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, if it is ultimately determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to any
appeal) that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under
applicable Law.   

(b) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
will contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification
than are set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Company, each as amended, as of the date hereof, unless any modification
thereof is required by Law and then Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to make such modification only to the minimum extent required by
such Law, which provisions may not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified, except as provided in this _Section 7.04(b)_, for a period of six
years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the
rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were
directors or officers of the Company.   

(c) The Company shall purchase at or prior to the Effective Time, and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, tail policies to the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance, which tail
policies (i) shall be effective for a period of six years after the Effective
Time with respect to claims arising from acts or omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time with respect to those Persons who are currently covered
by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance and (ii) shall
contain terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than those of such policy or policies as in effect on the date
hereof. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if the tail
policies described in the immediately preceding sentence cannot be obtained
or can only be obtained by paying aggregate premiums in excess of 150% of the
aggregate annual amount currently paid by the Company for such coverage, the
Surviving Corporation shall only be required to provide as much coverage as
can be obtained by paying aggregate premiums equal to 150% of the aggregate
annual amount currently paid by the Company for such coverage.   

(d) The parties hereto intend that the provisions of this _Section 7.04_ be
for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his
or her heirs and his or her representatives and are in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.   

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any
Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions of this _Section 7.04_ shall continue in effect until the
final disposition of such Action.   

(f) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall make, or cause to be made,
the proper provisions so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.04_.   

SECTION 7.05 _Regulatory Filings_.   

(a) From the date hereof through the Closing Date, Parent and Merger Sub shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary under applicable

waiting periods under the competition Laws of any Relevant Competition
Authority required for the consummation of the Transactions, including the

any material communication received or given in connection with
any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the
Transactions, (iii) permit the other party, or the other partys legal

other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or any
such other Relevant Competition Authority or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, (iv) give the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences to the extent allowed by applicable Law or by the applicable

delay consummation of the Transactions, to cause such injunction or order to
be vacated, modified or suspended so as to permit such consummation by the
Outside Date.   

(d) To assist Parent and Merger Sub in complying with their obligations set
forth in  _Section 7.05(c)_, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, enter into one or more agreements reasonably requested by

all rights and obligations of the Company and its Affiliates pursuant thereto
shall be assumed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation effective at the

the other hand, shall be treated as if the Divestiture was effected for the
account of Parent and Merger Sub and their Affiliates. The Company agrees
that, except for any agreement referred to in the immediately preceding
sentence, it shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Affiliates to, enter

with any Relevant Competition Authority with respect to the
Transactions.

Transactions (collectively, " _Gaming Approvals_ "); (ii) avoid any action or
proceeding by any Gaming Authority challenging the consummation of the
Transactions; (iii) make or cause to be made all necessary filings, and

parties hereto to consummate the Transactions under the Gaming Laws; (iv)
schedule and attend any hearings or meetings with Gaming Authorities to
obtain the Gaming Approvals as promptly as possible; and (v) comply with the
terms and conditions of any and all of the foregoing necessary to obtain the
Gaming Approvals. Parent and Merger Sub shall each use commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary or reasonably advisable to obtain
approval for consummation of the Transactions by any Gaming Authority before
the Outside Date, including, without limitation, using
commercially reasonable efforts to engage in Divestitures. Parent and Merger
Sub shall use commercially reasonable efforts, in the event that any
permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes
reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would
make consummation of the Transactions in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement unlawful or that would prevent or materially delay consummation of
the Transactions, to cause such injunction or order to be vacated, modified
or suspended so as to permit such consummation by the Outside Date.   

(f) Parent and Merger Sub shall cause all of their Affiliates who are, in the
view of the applicable Gaming Authorities, required to be licensed under
applicable Gaming Laws in order to consummate the Transactions (the "
_Licensed Persons_ "), to submit to the licensing process and, as promptly as

all necessary filings, consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations, Permits
or orders for all Gaming Authorities required to permit the parties hereto to
consummate the Transactions. Parent shall, and shall cause its
Representatives and Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to: (i) file or cause to be filed, as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof, (A) all required initial applications and documents in respect of
officers and directors of Parent, Affiliates of Parent or holders of equity
in Parent or its Affiliates, as applicable, in connection with obtaining
Gaming Approvals and (B) all other required applications and documents in
connection with obtaining Gaming Approvals; (ii) request or cause to be
requested an accelerated review from the Gaming Authorities in connection
with such filings; (iii) act diligently and promptly to pursue the Gaming
Approvals; (iv) cooperate with the Company in connection with making all
filings referenced in this _Section 7.05(f)_; and (v) keep the Special
Committee reasonably informed of the status of Parents application for
Gaming Approvals and its activities related to obtaining the Gaming
Approvals, as applicable, including promptly advising the Special Committee
upon receiving any communication from any Gaming Authority that causes Parent
or Merger Sub to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any
Gaming Approval required from such Gaming Authority will not be obtained or
that the receipt of any such approval will be delayed materially. For purposes
of this  _Section 7.05(f)_, references to Affiliates of Parent and/or Merger
Sub shall not be deemed to include the Company and its Subsidiaries.   

(g) Except as otherwise permitted by this Agreement, none of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company shall take or agree to take any action, including entering
into any Contracts with respect to any acquisitions, mergers, consolidations
or business combinations, that would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the ability of the parties to obtain an early termination of any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or any consents, waivers,
approvals, authorizations, Permits and approvals from Governmental
Authorities, Gaming Authorities and other third parties required for the
consummation of the Transactions or otherwise to prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of the parties to consummate the
Transactions.   

SECTION 7.06 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company agree that no
public release or announcement concerning the Transactions or the Merger
shall be issued by either party without the prior consent of the other party
(in the case of the Company, acting through the Special Committee if then in
existence or otherwise by resolution of a majority of
Disinterested Directors), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, except any such release or announcement that may be
required by Law or the rules or regulations of any securities exchange, in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other party reasonable time
to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance;
_provided_ , _however_ , that each of Parent and the Company may make any
public statement in response to specific questions by the press, analysts,
investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst
conference calls, so long as any such statements are not inconsistent with
previous public releases or announcements made by Parent or the Company in
compliance with this _Section 7.06_ and do not reveal non-public information
regarding the other party; _provided_ , _further_ ,  _however_ , that the
Company may issue any public release or announcement, without
prior consultation with Parent, contemplated by, or with respect to any
action taken pursuant to,  _Section 7.03_.   

SECTION 7.07 _Advice of Changes_. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) any notice
or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority
or any Gaming Authority in connection with the Merger or the other
Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Merger or the other Transactions, if
the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to
obtain such consent would be material to the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, (b) any Action commenced or, to such partys
Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relates to the Merger
or the other Transactions, and (c) the discovery of any fact or circumstance
that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which, would reasonably be likely to cause or result in any of
conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article VIII_ not being satisfied or
satisfaction of any of those conditions being materially delayed; _provided_
, _however_ , that the giving of any notice pursuant to this _Section 7.07_
will not (x) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision
of this Agreement, (y) limit the remedies available to the party receiving
such notice or (z) affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that the failure to give
prompt notice hereunder pursuant to this _Section 7.07_ will not constitute
a failure of a condition to the Merger set forth in  _Article VIII_ except
to the extent that the underlying fact, circumstance or event not so notified
would standing alone constitute such a failure.   

SECTION 7.08 _Debt Financing_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and consummate the Debt Financing as promptly as
practicable but in any event on or before the Closing Date, including using
its commercially reasonable efforts to (x) negotiate definitive agreements
with respect to the Debt Financing, and (y) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in such
definitive agreements that are within their Control. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
comply, and to cause its applicable Subsidiaries to comply, in all material
respects with the terms of the definitive agreements with respect to the Debt

entered into with respect thereto. The Company shall (i) furnish to

rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties agree and acknowledge
that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or

as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company), the right
to Control or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective Time and
(b) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete Control and supervision
over its operations, including through Fertitta in his capacity as a member
of the Board and as President and Chief Executive Officer of the
Company.

terminated, and (B) in any of cases (x), (y) and (z), within twelve
months after the date of such termination, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to or consummates such Acquisition

"); _provided_ , _however_ , that " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean $2,400,000
(the " _Go Shop Termination Fee_ ") if the Acquisition Proposal that results

of the Go Shop Termination Fee or the Post Go Shop Termination Fee, as
applicable: (i) Parents right to receive the Go Shop Termination Fee or the
Post Go Shop Termination Fee, as applicable, pursuant to this _Section
9.03(b)_ shall be Parents sole and exclusive remedy against the Company or

(ii) upon payment of all amounts that are required to be paid pursuant to
this _Section 9.03(b)_, none of the Company or any of its Affiliates,
stockholders, directors, officers, Employees, agents or Representatives shall
have any further Liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions (other than any obligation to pay any amounts
due pursuant to the second sentence of _Section 9.03(d)_).

to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee: (i) the Companys right to
receive the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this  _Section 9.03(c)_ shall
be the Companys sole and exclusive remedy against Parent, Merger Sub or any

relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions (other than
any obligation to pay any amounts due pursuant to the second sentence of
_Section 9.03(d)_). If (x) the condition in _Section 8.01(d)_ is not
satisfied as the result of the lenders providing the Debt Financing not being
able to make the Debt Financing available on terms that are substantially
similar to those specified in _Section 7.08_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, by reason of the occurrence of (x) an act of God, (ii) a suspension
or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York
Stock Exchange or a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in
New York declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a
suspension of payments in respect of federal or state banks in the United
States (whether or not mandatory), (iii) the outbreak or escalation of
hostilities directly involving the United States or the declaration by the
United States of a national emergency or war or an act of terrorism or (iv)
an adverse and material change in financial or securities markets
or commercial banking conditions in the United States and (y) this Agreement
is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.01(e)_, then no Parent
Termination Fee shall be payable to the Company and none of Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents or Representatives shall have any Liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions;
_provided_ , that Parent may not claim that a breach of the Companys
obligations under _Section 7.08_ caused the Debt Financing not to be made
available.   

(d) Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in
_Section 9.02(a)(i)_ and this _Section 9.03_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that without these
agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company would not enter into this
Agreement. If the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay
any amounts due to the other party pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)(i)_ and/or
this  _Section 9.03_, then such paying party shall reimburse the other party
for all costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by such other party
(including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the
collection under and enforcement of _Section 9.02(a)(i)_ and/or this
_Section 9.03_.   

SECTION 9.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
at any time prior to the Effective Time by action taken (a) with respect to
Parent and Merger Sub, by their respective Boards of Directors or other
governing body and (b) with respect to the Company, by the Special Committee
if then in existence or otherwise by resolution of a majority of
its Disinterested Directors; _provided_ , _that_ , after the adoption of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment may be made that
would reduce the amount or change the type of consideration into which each
Share shall be converted upon consummation of the Merger or that would
otherwise by Law require approval of the stockholders of the Company,
without approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may only be amended
pursuant to a written agreement signed by each of the parties hereto.   

SECTION 9.05 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
hereto, (a) with respect to Parent and Merger Sub, by their respective Boards
of Directors or other governing body and (b) with respect to the Company, by
the Special Committee if then in existence or otherwise by resolution of a
majority of its Disinterested Directors, may in its sole discretion (x)
extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of any
other party hereto, (y) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and
(z) waive compliance with any agreement or condition contained herein. Any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby.

SECTION 10.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto, in
the case of the Company, by the Special Committee if then in existence or
otherwise by resolution of a majority of its Disinterested Directors, shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.   

SECTION 10.04 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, together with
the exhibits hereto, the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure
Letter, constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be
assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent
of the other parties, and any assignment without such consent shall be null
and void, except that, subject to _Section 7.04(f)_, Parent and Merger Sub
may assign all or any of their rights and obligations hereunder to any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent; _provided_ that no such
assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder;
_provided_ , _further_ , that as a condition of such assignment, the assignee
expressly assumes the obligations of the assignor.   

SECTION 10.05 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than _Section 7.04_ (which is intended to be
for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such
Persons).   

SECTION 10.06 _Specific Performance_.   

(a) Subject to _Section 10.06(b)_, the parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties are
entitled to seek specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any
other remedy at Law or equity including monetary damages (which the parties
agree, in the case of a willful breach of a representation, warranty or
covenant, may not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket
costs and, to the extent proven, may include the benefit of the bargain of
the Merger to such party, including the benefit of the bargain lost by
the Companys unaffiliated stockholders, adjusted to account for the time
value of money).   

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that _Section 9.02(a)(i)_,
_Section 9.03(b)_ or _Section 9.03(c)_ become operative, any Expense
Reimbursement Amount, Go Shop Termination Fee, Post Go Shop Termination Fee
or Parent Termination Fee, as the case may be, paid in accordance with
_Section 9.02(a)(i)_, _Section 9.03(b)_ or _Section 9.03(c)_ shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the other party to the extent set forth in such
sections.   

SECTION 10.07 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any claim, controversy or
dispute arising under or related to this Agreement, the relationship of the
parties hereunder and/or the interpretation and enforcement of the rights and
duties of the parties hereunder shall be governed by, construed and enforced
in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the
conflict of laws principles thereof.   

SECTION 10.08 _Jurisdiction; Venue_. All Actions arising out of or relating to
this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in any Delaware
state or federal court. The parties hereto hereby (A) submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any Delaware state or federal court for the purpose of any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party
hereto, and (B) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion,
defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject
personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property
is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought
in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or
that this Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of
the above-named courts;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such consent to
jurisdiction is solely for the purpose referred to in this _Section 10.08_
and shall not be deemed to be a general submission to the jurisdiction of
such court or in the State of Delaware other than for such purposes.   

SECTION 10.09 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a
trial by jury with respect to any Action directly or indirectly arising out
of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each of
the parties hereto (A) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of
any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party
would not, in the event of any Action, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver
and (B) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced
to enter into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among
other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this  _Section
10.09_.   

SECTION 10.10 _Interpretation_.   

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, a Section or
Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article of, a Section of, or an
Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.   

(b) The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.   

(c) Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation," whether or not they are in fact followed by those words or words
of like import.   

(d) The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby" and "hereunder" and words of
similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.   

(e) All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when
used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto
unless otherwise defined therein.   

(f) The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular
as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to
the feminine and neuter genders of such term.   

(g) References to any Person include the successors and permitted assigns of
that Person.   

(h) "Writing," "written" and comparable terms refer to printing, typing and
other means of reproducing words (including electronic media) in a visible
form.   

(i) References to any agreement, instrument, statute, rule or regulation are
to the agreement, instrument, statute, rule or regulation as amended,
modified, supplemented or replaced from time to time (and, in the case of
statutes, include any rules and regulations promulgated under said statutes)
and to any section of any statute, rule or regulation including any successor
to said section.   

(j) Time periods within or following which any payment is to be made or act is
to be done shall be calculated by excluding the day on which the period
commences and including the day on which the period ends and by extending the
period to the next Business Day following if the last day of the period is
not a Business Day.   

SECTION 10.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission or .pdf format) in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.   

SECTION 10.12 _Fertitta Guarantee_.   

(a) _Obligations_. As a condition and inducement to the Companys willingness
to enter into this Agreement, Fertitta hereby absolutely and irrevocably
guarantees to the Company, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this _Section 10.12_, the prompt payment, on demand and in lawful
money of the United States, of Parents payment obligations under
_Section 9.03(a)_ , _Section 9.03(c)_ and the second sentence of _Section
9.03(d)_ of this Agreement (the " _Obligations_ ").   

(b) _Continuing Guaranty_. This _Section 10.12_ is a continuing guaranty of
the Obligations and shall remain in full force and effect until the first to
occur of (i) the indefeasible payment in full of the Obligations, (ii) the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, but only if
neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any Obligation to the Company that survives
such termination and (iii) the Effective Time (the " _Guarantee Termination_
"). Upon the Guarantee Termination, this _Section 10.12_ shall
automatically become void and Fertitta shall thereafter have no Liability
arising under this _Section 10.12_. Fertitta understands and agrees that,
subject to the immediately preceding two sentences, this _Section 10.12_
shall be binding upon Fertitta and his successors and assigns, shall be
construed as an absolute, irrevocable and continuing guaranty of payment
and shall be enforceable by the Company and its successors, transferees and
assigns, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.   

(c) _Nature of Obligations; Change of Obligations_.   

(i) The Company shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the
Obligations if Parent or Merger Sub becomes subject to a bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of the Company to so
file shall not affect Fertittas obligations under this _Section 10.12_. If
any payment to the Company under this _Section 10.12_ is rescinded or
must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever, Fertitta shall remain
liable under this  _Section 10.12_ with respect to the Obligations as if
such payment had not been made. Any circumstance which operates to toll any
statute of limitations applicable to Merger Sub or Parent shall also operate
to toll the statute of limitations applicable to Fertitta.   

(ii) Fertitta authorizes Merger Sub, Parent and the Company, without notice or
demand and without affecting Fertittas Liability under this _Section
10.12_, from time to time, to make any change to the terms of this Agreement
(other than under this _Section 10.12_, which shall require Fertittas prior
written consent) or in any other term of all or any of the Obligations,
or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from this
Agreement or any of the documents executed in connection herewith.   

(d) _Waivers_.   

(i) Fertitta hereby waives any right he may have to (i) require the Company to
proceed against Parent or any other Person liable on the Obligations or to
pursue any other remedy in the Companys power whatsoever, and (ii) have the
proceeds of property of Merger Sub, Parent or any other Person liable on the
Obligations first applied to the discharge of the Obligations. When making
any demand on Fertitta under this _Section 10.12_ against the Obligations,
the Company has the right, but is not required, to make a similar demand on
Parent, and any failure by the Company to make any such demand or to collect
any payments from Parent will not relieve Fertitta of his obligations or
Liabilities under this _Section 10.12_. The Company may, at its
election, exercise any right or remedy it may have against Parent or any
other Person without affecting or impairing in any way the Liability of
Fertitta, except to the extent the Obligations have been indefeasibly
paid.   

(ii) Fertitta agrees that, except to the extent the Obligations have been
indefeasibly paid, his obligations under this _Section 10.12_ shall not be
released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by: (A)
the failure of the Company to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any
right or remedy against Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person interested in
the Transactions; (B) any change in the scope, time, place or manner of
performance of any of the Obligations or any rescission, waiver, compromise,
consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement or any other Contract evidencing, securing
or otherwise executed in connection with any of the Obligations; (C) the
addition, substitution or release of any entity or other Person interested in
the Transactions; (D) any change in the corporate existence, structure or
ownership of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person interested in the
Transactions; (E) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar
proceeding affecting Parent or Merger Sub; (F) the existence of any claim,
set-off or other right which Fertitta may have at any time against Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company, other than in connection with the Obligations; (G)
the adequacy of any other means the Company may have of obtaining payment of
any of the Obligations; (H) any lack of authority of any officer, director or
any other Person acting or purporting to act on behalf of Merger Sub or
Parent, or any defect in the formation of Merger Sub or Parent; (I) any act
or omission by Merger Sub or Parent which directly or indirectly results in
or aids the discharge of Parent from any Obligations by operation of Law or
otherwise; or (J) any modification of the Obligations, in any form
whatsoever, including, without limitation, the renewal, extension,
acceleration or other change in time for payment of the Obligations,
any waiver or modification of conditions precedent or any other change in the
terms of the Obligations or any part thereof.   

(iii) Fertitta hereby waives all presentments, demands for performance,
notices of nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor
and notices of acceptance of his obligations under this _Section 10.12_ and
of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional obligations,
other than notice required by _Section 10.02_.   

(iv) Fertitta hereby waives notice of any action taken or omitted by the
Company in reliance on or under this _Section 10.12_, any requirement that
the Company be diligent and prompt in making demands under this _Section
10.12_, notice of any waiver or amendment of any terms and conditions of this
Agreement (other than under this _Section 10.12_), notice of any default by
Merger Sub or Parent or the assertion of any right of the Company under this
_Section 10.12_ , and any right to plead or assert any election of remedies
in any action to enforce this  _Section 10.12_ in respect of his obligations
hereunder.   

(e) _No Waiver; Cumulative Rights_. No failure on the part of the Company to
exercise, and no delay by the Company in exercising, any of its rights,
remedies or powers under this  _Section 10.12_ will operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Company of any of
its rights, remedies or powers under this _Section 10.12_ preclude
the Company from any other or future exercise of any its rights, remedies or
powers. Each and every right, remedy and power hereby granted to the Company
or allowed it by Law or other agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive
of any other, and may be exercised by the Company at any time or from time to
time.   

(f) _Bankruptcy Not Discharge_. The Company shall not be obligated to file
any claim relating to any Obligation in the event that Parent or Merger Sub
becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and
the failure of the Company to so file shall not affect Fertittas obligations
under this _Section 10.12_. Subject to the second sentence of  _Section
10.12(b)_, the obligations under this _Section 10.12_ shall continue to
be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if, and solely to the
extent, at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any or all of the
Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the
Company upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Merger Sub or
Parent. Notwithstanding any modification, discharge or extension of the
Obligations or any amendment, waiver, modification, stay or cure of the
Companys rights which may occur in any bankruptcy or reorganization case or
proceeding concerning Merger Sub or Parent, whether permanent or
temporary, and whether or not assented to by the Company, Fertitta hereby
agrees that he shall be obligated under this _Section 10.12_ to pay the
Obligations as set forth in this _Section 10.12_ in effect on the date
hereof. Fertitta understands and acknowledges that by virtue of this 
_Section 10.12_, he has specifically assumed any and all risks of a
bankruptcy or reorganization case or proceeding with respect to Merger Sub or
Parent.   

(g) _Fertitta s Understanding With Respect to Waivers_. Fertitta
acknowledges that (a) he will receive substantial direct and indirect
benefits from the Transactions, (b) each waiver set forth in this _Section
10.12_ is knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits, with Fertittas
full knowledge of its significance and consequences and made after the
opportunity to consult with counsel of his own choosing, and (c) under the
circumstances, the waivers are reasonable and not contrary to public policy
or Law. If any of said waivers are determined to be contrary to any
applicable Law or public policy, such waiver shall be effective only to the
extent permitted by Law.   

(h) _Survival of Covenants_. All covenants and agreements of Fertitta
contained in this  _Section 10.12_ shall survive the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and shall be deemed made continuously, and shall continue
in full force and effect, until the Guarantee Termination.   

[ _Signature Page Follows_ ]    

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their
respective officers thereunto duly authorized.

jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application in
a summary way of this Corporation or any creditor or stockholder thereof or

Corporation under the provisions of Section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware
Code or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver
or receivers appointed for this Corporation under the provisions of Section
279 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code order a meeting of the creditors or class

consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the said compromise

SEVENTH: To the fullest extent that the General Corporation Law of the State

amended, permits the limitation or elimination of the liability of directors,
no director of this Corporation shall be personally liable to this
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary

misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (3) under section 174 of the

shall eliminate, reduce or adversely affect any right or protection of
a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment or
repeal.

power to indemnify under said section from and against any and all of the
expenses, liabilities or other matters referred to in or covered by said
section. The Corporation shall advance expenses to the fullest extent
permitted by said section. Such right to indemnification and advancement of
expenses shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director,
officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
executors and administrators of such a person. The indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of
expenses may be entitled under any By-Law, agreement, vote of stockholders
or disinterested directors or otherwise. Neither the amendment, modification
or repeal of this Article, nor the adoption of any provision of this
Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article, nor, to the
fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware or other applicable law, any modification of law, shall
eliminate, reduce or adversely affect any right to indemnification or
advancement of expenses expressly provided by or granted pursuant to this
Article EIGHTH.   

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I, the undersigned, do hereby declare and certify that the
facts herein stated are true, and accordingly have hereunto set my hand this
