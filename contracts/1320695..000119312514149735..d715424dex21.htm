     | (a) | Not later than seventy-five (75) days after the Closing
Date, the Purchaser shall, acting in good faith and using all reasonable
efforts, cause to be calculated on a basis consistent with the calculation
of Estimated Closing Date Working Capital in Section 2.2(b) (and, for greater
certainty, the Transaction Expenses shall not be a liability for this
purpose), in each case, to be prepared and delivered to the Sellers Agent:
(i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company, as at the end of
the day on the day prior to the Closing Date, which balance sheet shall be
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles on a
basis consistent with the preparation of the Financial Statements (and where
generally accepted accounting principles provide for a range of alternatives,
past practices shall govern) (the " _Draft Closing Date Balance Sheet_ " and,
as finally determined pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.6 the "
_Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "); (ii) a statement of Working Capital as at the
end of the day on the day prior to the Closing Date (the " _Draft Closing Date
Working Capital Statement_ " and, as finally determined pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 2.6, the " _Closing Date Working Capital Statement_
") based on the Draft Closing Date Balance Sheet, which such Draft Closing
Date Working Capital Statement shall set out draft Working Capital as at the
end of the day on the day prior to the Closing Date (such draft Working
Capital as of the Closing Date, as finally determined pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 2.6, referred to as the " _Closing Date Working
Capital_ "); (iii) a calculation of the Closing Income Taxes, (iv) a
calculation of the Retained Indebtedness Amount and (v) a calculation of the
Closing Date Capex. The Sellers Agent shall reasonably cooperate with the
Purchaser and its accountants to the extent required to prepare the Draft
Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Draft Closing Date Working Capital Statement
and the calculation of the Closing Income Taxes, the Retained Indebtedness
Amount and the Closing Date Capex (collectively, the " _Draft Closing
Statements_ "). 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

During the period from the date the Draft Closing Statements are delivered by
the Purchaser to the Sellers Agent through the date such statements are
finally determined in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.6, the
Purchaser shall and shall cause each of the Purchasers, the Companys and the
Companys Subsidiaries respective Representatives to reasonably cooperate
with the Sellers Agent and the Sellers Agents Representatives and to
provide the Sellers Agent 

---|---|--- 
 



-21- work papers of the Purchaser relating to the Company, the Companys
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives in connection with the
review of the Draft Closing Statements, and the Purchaser shall make
reasonably available to the Sellers Agent and the Sellers Agents
Representatives individuals responsible for the preparation of the
Draft Closings Statements in order to respond to inquiries of the Sellers
Agent related thereto. 
---|--- 



     | (c) | If the Sellers Agent notifies the Purchaser that the
Sellers agree with any of the Draft Closing Statements within forty-five (45)
days after receipt thereof or fails to deliver notice to the Purchaser of
its disagreement therewith within such forty-five (45) day period, any such
Draft Closing Statements shall be conclusive and binding on the Sellers and
the Purchaser and the parties shall be deemed to have agreed thereto, in the
first case, on the date the Purchaser receives the notice and, in the second
case, on such forty-fifth (45th) day. If the Sellers Agent disagrees with any
of the Draft Closing Statements or the calculation of Closing Date Working
Capital as set forth therein, then the Sellers Agent shall notify the
Purchaser of its disagreement (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") within such forty-
five (45) day period together with reasonable particulars of the basis of
such dispute, including the Sellers Agents position on the amounts in
dispute (and the resulting Sellers Agent position on the amount of the
Closing Date Working Capital). In such event, the Sellers Agent and the
Purchaser shall work expeditiously and attempt, in good faith, to resolve
their differences with respect thereto within fifteen (15) days after the
receipt by the Purchaser of the Dispute Notice and make any amendments to the
Draft Closing Statements as mutually agreed to by the parties. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

Any dispute over any of the Draft Closing Statements or the calculation of
Closing Date Working Capital as set forth in the Dispute Notice not resolved
by the Purchaser and the Sellers Agent within such fifteen (15) day period
after receipt of the Dispute Notice (or such other period as the parties may
agree) shall be submitted to the Independent Auditor to determine
such dispute, and such determination shall be final and binding on the
parties. The Independent Auditor shall allow the Purchaser and the Sellers
Agent to present their respective positions regarding the dispute (provided
that, for greater certainty, such presentations are limited to matters
described in the Dispute Notice) and each of the Purchaser and the Sellers
Agent shall have the right to present additional documents, materials and
other information, and make an oral presentation to the Independent Auditor,
regarding such dispute and the Independent Auditor shall consider such
additional documents, materials and other information and such oral
presentation. Any such other documents, materials or other information shall
be copied to each of the Purchaser and the Sellers and each of the Sellers and
the Purchaser shall be entitled to attend any such oral presentation. The
Independent Auditor shall determine, based solely on such presentations
from the Sellers Agent and the Purchaser and not by independent review, only
those issues in dispute specifically set forth in the Dispute Notice and shall
render a written report (the " _Adjustment Report_ ") to the Sellers,
the Sellers Agent and the Purchaser in which the Independent Auditor shall,
after considering all matters set forth in the Dispute Notice, determine what
adjustments, if any, should be made to the Draft Closing Date Balance Sheet,
the  

---|---|--- 
 



-22- Date Working Capital. The Adjustment Report shall set forth, in reasonable
detail, the Independent Auditors determination with respect to each of the
disputed items or amounts specified in the Dispute Notice, and the revisions,
if any, to be made to any of the Draft Closing Statements and/or the Closing
Date Working Capital, together with supporting calculations, and the parties
shall make such revisions to the Draft Closing Statements, as applicable. In
resolving any disputed item, the Independent Auditor shall: (i) be bound to
the principles of this Section 2.6 (including _Schedule 2.6(a)_), (ii) limit
its review to matters specifically set forth in the Dispute Notice, and (iii)
not assign a value to any item higher than the highest value for such item
claimed by either party or lower than the lowest value for such item claimed
by either party. The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Independent Auditor to complete its work and render its
determination within thirty (30) days of its engagement. The costs, fees and
expenses of the Independent Auditor shall be allocated to and borne by the
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers as a group, on the other hand,
(with each Seller responsible only for its Pro Rata Share of the Sellers
portion) based on the inverse of the percentage that the Independent
Auditors determination (before such allocation) bears to the total amount of
the total items in dispute as originally submitted to the Independent Auditor.
For example, should the difference in the dollar amount of the items in
dispute total $1,000 and the Independent Auditor awards $600 in favor of the
Purchasers position, 60% of the costs of the Independent Auditors review
would be borne by Sellers as a group, (with each Seller responsible for its
Pro Rata Share of such costs) and 40% of the costs would be borne by the
Purchaser. 
---|--- 



     | (e) | For greater certainty, each of the Closing Date Working
Capital, Closing Date Working Capital Statement, Draft Closing Date Working
Capital Statement, Estimated Closing Date Working Capital and Target Working
Capital are to be calculated and prepared in a manner consistent, and in
accordance with, the indicative Working Capital calculation set forth in
_Schedule 2.6(a)_. 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 2.7 Payment of Purchase Price Adjustments



     | (a) | On the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which
the last of the Draft Closing Statements has been finalized in accordance with
Section 2.6 (whether by agreement of the parties, deemed agreement or by
determination made by the Independent Auditor pursuant to Section 2.6(d))
(such date, the " _Settlement Date_ "), the payments contemplated by Section
2.7(b) shall be made. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | On the Settlement Date, 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | if the Closing Date Working Capital, plus the Closing Date
Capex, minus the Closing Income Taxes, minus the Retained Indebtedness Amount
is greater than the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital, plus the
Estimated Capex, minus the Estimated Closing Income Taxes minus the Estimated
Retained Indebtedness Amount, the Purchaser shall pay such surplus amount to
the Sellers Agent on behalf of the Sellers to be distributed to each Seller
in accordance with its Pro Rata Share; and 
---|---|--- 
 



-23- Date Capex, minus the Closing Income Taxes, minus the Retained Indebtedness
Amount is less than the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital, plus the
Estimated Capex, minus the Estimated Closing Income Taxes, minus the
Estimated Retained Indebtedness Amount, the Sellers shall severally, and not
jointly or jointly and severally, pay such deficiency to the Purchaser in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share. 
---|---|--- 

Section 2.8 Payments and Location of Closing

 

Any reference in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement to payment shall mean payment by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in Canadian dollars to the bank account or accounts designated
by the recipient of such payment in writing to the Purchaser or to the
Sellers, as the case may be, not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the
date of such payment. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Goodmans
LLP located at 333 Bay Street, Suite 3400, Toronto, Ontario at 10:00 a.m.
(Toronto time) on the Closing Date or such other place or time as may be
agreed by the Purchaser and Sellers Agent.

Section 2.9 Withholding

 

To the extent Sellers comply with _Section 2.5(xi)_, the parties acknowledge
and agree that no withholding is anticipated from payments of the Purchase
Price at the time of Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser and
the Company will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount payable
pursuant to this Agreement (including payments of Purchase Price upon a
change in applicable Laws, and releases of amounts held in the Indemnity
Escrow Account) such amounts as the Purchaser or the Company (or any Affiliate
thereof) shall determine in good faith they are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the ITA, the Code
or any other provision of applicable Laws. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Purchaser or the Company and remitted to appropriate
Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding were made.

 

Section 2.10 Treatment of Options



     | (a) | If necessary, the Company will amend the Option Plan prior
to Closing to provide that all of the Options will vest immediately prior to
Closing. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Immediately prior to the time that is immediately prior to
Closing, the Purchaser will lend an amount to each Seller Option Holder equal
to the Option Exercise Price of such Seller Option Holders Options
in respect of such Options, as set out in Schedule B (each an " _Option Loan_
"). 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Immediately prior to Closing, each Seller Option Holder will
exercise his or her Options and hereby irrevocably directs the Purchaser to
pay the amount borrowed pursuant to such Seller Option Holders Option
Loan to the Company or the relevant Company Subsidiary, or as the Company or
the relevant Company Subsidiary may further direct, in satisfaction of the
Option Exercise Price in respect of such Options. 
---|---|--- 
 



-24- irrevocably direct the Purchaser to pay all amounts to which the Company and
the Companys Subsidiaries are entitled pursuant to (c) above to repay
a portion of the Closing Indebtedness pursuant to Section 2.3(ii) above. 
---|---|--- 

Section 2.11 Retained Indebtedness

 



     | (a) | Retained Indebtedness shall be determined based on a written
confirmation of such indebtedness owing at Closing provided by the applicable
lender/lessor, failing which it shall be determined in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and on a basis consistent with the
preparation of the Financial Statements on a consolidated basis for the
Company and the Companys Subsidiaries. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | The Sellers agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any consents required under the Retained Indebtedness for completion of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (without involving
the expenditure of any funds by the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries or
the Sellers). In the event that any such required consents cannot be obtained
prior to Closing, such Retained Indebtedness for which consent cannot be
obtained shall cease to be Retained Indebtedness and shall become Closing
Indebtedness for all purposes under this Agreement.

indemnify the current and former directors and officers of the Company and

-58- action so as to amend, modify or repeal the provisions for indemnification of
directors, officers or employees contained in the organizational documents of

affect the rights of any individual who shall have served as a director or
officer of the Company and/or the Companys Subsidiaries prior to the Closing
to be indemnified by such corporations in respect of their serving in such
capacities at or prior to the Closing. 
---|---

conditioned, none of the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries shall take any
position on (including making or changing any Tax election), amend, re-file or
otherwise modify (or grant any extension of any applicable statute of
limitation with respect to) any Tax Return (including any amendment thereto)

---|---|--- 
 



-60- Return following the Closing Date without the prior written consent of the

Purchaser has no comments, (ii) the form agreed to by Sellers Agent and the

---|--- 



     | (c) | The Purchaser shall prepare, or caused to be prepared all
Tax Returns (other than Seller Tax Returns) required to be filed by the
Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries after the Closing Date
(collectively, " _Purchaser Tax Returns_ "). Unless otherwise resulting from
the procedures set forth in this Section 8.3(c) (including as a result of a
resolution pursuant to Section 8.3(e)), each Purchaser Tax Return, to the
extent that it relates to a Sellers Tax Period, shall be prepared in
accordance with existing procedures and practices and accounting methods of
the Company or the applicable Companys Subsidiary, unless, as reasonably

inconsistent with any election to be made in accordance with Section 8.3(d).
The Sellers Agent shall be given the opportunity to review, comment upon and
suggest changes or corrections to any Purchaser Tax Return to the extent it
relates to a Seller Tax Period (it being understood that the Purchaser shall
consider in good faith all reasonable changes or corrections to any Purchaser

meeting such thirty (30) day period shall not reduce or otherwise affect the
obligation or liabilities of the Sellers for such Indemnified Taxes, except to
the extent such failure or delay actually prejudices the Sellers. The
Purchaser shall cause the Company or the applicable Companys Subsidiary to
file each Purchaser Tax Return in (i) the form prepared by the Purchaser, if
the Sellers Agent has no comments, (ii) the form agreed to by the Purchaser
and the Sellers Agent, if the Sellers Agent has comments, or (iii) the form

---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) |

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers and the Purchaser agree that the
Purchaser, at the request of the Sellers Agent or the Purchaser, shall cause
the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries to make an election pursuant to
subsection 256(9) of the ITA in respect of their taxation year ending
immediately prior to the acquisition of control of the Company and the
Companys Subsidiaries by the Purchaser. Without limiting the generality of
Section 6.2 and Section 7.4, the Purchaser shall, and the Purchaser shall
cause the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries to, fully cooperate with each
other and the Sellers Agent (including allowing access by the Sellers Agent
and its Representatives to the Company Books and Records and allowing the
Sellers Agent (and its Representatives) to make copies thereof) in connection

---|---|--- 
 



-61- charged with any cost or expense for the assistance rendered by the Purchaser,

in connection therewith (other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of third
parties incurred by the Purchaser or its Affiliates or the Sellers Agent). 
---|--- 



     | (e) | In the event of any dispute regarding the matters set forth
in Section 8.3(b) or (c), the Purchaser (in the case of a dispute regarding a
Seller Tax Return) or the Sellers Agent (in the case of a dispute regarding
a Purchaser Tax Return) shall provide the Sellers Agent or the Purchaser, as
the case may be, with written notice thereof within ten (10) days of its
access to such Seller Tax Returns or Purchaser Tax Return, as the case may
be, or amendments thereto, and the parties shall act in good faith to resolve
such dispute. If the parties cannot resolve such dispute within ten (10) days
of notice thereof, the Independent Auditor shall be requested to make a
determination resolving any such dispute and such determination shall be
final and binding. The Independent Auditor shall allow the Purchaser and the
Sellers Agent to present their respective positions regarding the dispute
(provided that, for greater certainty, such presentations are limited to
matters described in the Purchasers or Sellers Agent dispute notice, as the
case maybe, referred to above), and each of the Purchaser and the Sellers
Agent shall have the right to present additional documents, materials and
other information and to make an oral presentation to the Independent Auditor
regarding such dispute and the Independent Auditor shall consider such
additional documents, materials and other information and such oral
presentation. Any such other documents, materials or other information shall
be copied to each of the Purchaser and the Sellers Agent and each of the
Sellers Agent and the Purchaser shall be entitled to attend any such
oral presentation. The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Independent Auditor to complete its work within ten (10) days of its
engagement. The costs, fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall be
allocated to and borne by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers as
a group, on the other hand, (with each Seller responsible only for its Pro
Rata Share of the Sellers portion) based on the inverse of the percentage
that the Independent Auditors determination (before such allocation) bears
to the total amount of the total items in dispute as originally submitted to
the Independent Auditor. For example, should the items in dispute total in
amount to $1,000 and the Independent Auditor awards $600 in favor of the
Purchasers position, 60% of the costs of the Independent Auditors review
would be borne by Sellers as a group, (with each Seller responsible only for
its Pro Rata Share of such costs) and 40% of the costs would be borne by the
Purchaser. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | The Purchaser shall timely pay or cause the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary to timely pay all Taxes shown as being payable on any
Seller Tax Return or Purchaser Tax Return that are not Indemnified Taxes.
The Sellers shall timely pay or timely reimburse, the Purchaser, the Company
or the applicable Subsidiary, for any Taxes shown on a Seller Tax Return or
Purchaser Tax Return that are Indemnified Taxes, in each case, first from the
Indemnity Escrow Account and to the extent such account is insufficient to
pay such amounts, the remainder in accordance with Article 11\. 
---|---|--- 
 



-62- foreign Tax purposes report the purchase and sale hereunder and the
transactions contemplated herein or under the other Transaction Documents in
accordance with their form and structure as set out herein and none of the
Sellers shall make any available Tax elections inconsistent therewith.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser shall be entitled to make an
election under Code Section 338(g) with respect to its acquisition of the
Company (and any of the Company Subsidiaries), provided that none of the
Sellers shall be liable for any Taxes of the Company or the Companys
Subsidiaries resulting from such election. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (h) | If a refund of Taxes (including Transaction Employment
Taxes, but excluding refunds of Transfer Taxes, which shall be allocated in
the same manner as such Transfer Taxes were paid under Section 8.3(k)) (to
the extent not reflected in the Closing Date Working Capital Statement) (the
" _Refund_ ") is received by or credited to the account of the Company or any
of the Companys Subsidiaries in respect of any Sellers Tax Period,
the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to pay, within thirty (30) days of the Refund,
the amount of the Refund (net of any Taxes (including Taxes incurred on
repatriating the amount of such refund to the Purchaser) and any reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses that the Purchaser, the Company, or any of the
Companys Subsidiaries incur (or has or will incur) with respect to such
Refund) to the Sellers Agent on behalf of the Sellers to be allocated in
accordance with their Pro Rata Share. For purposes of this Section 8.3(h), the
Refund shall include actual receipt of a refund or interest, as well as a
credit or offset of or against any other actual or estimated Tax liability or
any interest or penalties on such Tax liability. Any amounts payable under
this Section 8.3(h) shall constitute an adjustment in the Purchase Price.
Nothing in this Section 8.3(h) shall require that the Purchaser make
any payment with respect to any Refund (and such Refunds shall be for the
benefit of the Purchaser, the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries) that is
with respect to (A) any refund of Tax that is the result of the carrying back
of any net operating loss, non-capital loss or other Tax attribute or Tax
credit incurred in any Purchasers Tax Period; (B) any refund of Tax resulting
from the payments of Taxes made on or after Closing Date to the extent (x) the
Sellers have not indemnified the Purchaser, the Company, or the applicable
Companys Subsidiary for such Taxes, or (y) that such Tax was not included as
a liability in the computation of either the Closing Date Working Capital or
the Closing Income Taxes, each as finally determined; (C) any refund for Tax
that is reflected as a current asset (or offset to a current liability) on the
Closing Date Working Capital, as finally determined; or (D) any refund for Tax
that the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries is required to pay to
any Person pursuant to an obligation that arose under applicable Law, or under
a Contract entered into (or assumed) by the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries, on or prior to Closing, other than an obligation to pay
Sellers Agent for any Tax Refunds that are for the benefit of the Sellers
pursuant to this Section 8.3(h). 
---|---|--- 
 



-63- to the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries that relate to a Straddle
Period shall be apportioned between the Sellers Tax Period, on the one hand,
and the Purchasers Tax Period, on the other hand, on the basis that the
Straddle Period consisted of two taxable periods, one that ended at the close
of business on the day immediately before the Closing Date and the other that
began on the Closing Date, and such Taxes shall be allocated between two such
periods in the following manner: (i) in the case of Taxes other than Taxes
based upon or related to income, sales, gross receipts, wages, capital
expenditures, expenses or any similar Tax base, the amount of Tax allocable
to a portion of the Straddle Period shall be the total amount of such Tax for
the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in such portion of such Straddle Period and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in such Straddle Period and
(ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income, sales, gross
receipts, wages, capital expenditures, expenses, withholding taxes or any
similar Tax base, the amount of such Tax that is allocable to the portion of
such Straddle Period that ends before the Closing Date shall be deemed to be
equal to the amount that would be payable if the relevant Straddle Period had
ended at the close of business on the day immediately before the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of allocating income Tax of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period between the
Sellers Tax Period and Purchasers Tax Period, any Transaction Tax
Deductions, and any income or loss from discharging of any intercompany
payables or receivables pursuant to Section 6.5 shall be taken into account
for the portion of the Straddle Period which is the Sellers Tax Period. All
determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations
(including amortization and depreciation deductions) will be made in a manner
consistent with prior practice of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries. 
---|---|--- 



     | (j) | The Company or the applicable Companys Subsidiary shall
control any audit or other Legal Proceeding in respect of any Tax Return or
Taxes of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries (a " _Tax Contest_
"; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the Sellers Agent, at the Sellers sole
cost and expense, shall have the right to participate in any such Tax Contest
to the extent it relates to a Sellers Tax Period and (B) the Purchaser shall
not allow the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries to settle or
otherwise resolve any Tax Contest if such settlement or other resolution
relates to Taxes for a Sellers Tax Period without the prior written
permission of the Sellers Agent (which will not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed, or conditioned). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Tax Contest
relates solely to any Seller Tax Returns, the Sellers Agent, at the Sellers
sole cost and expense, shall control such Tax Contest; _provided_ , _however_
, (A) the Sellers Agent shall control such contest diligently and in good
faith as if the Sellers were solely responsible for all resulting Taxes; (B)
the Sellers Agent shall keep the Purchaser reasonably informed regarding the
status of such Tax Contest; (C) the Purchaser shall have the right to
participate, or cause the Company or applicable Subsidiary to participate in
such Tax Contest; and (D) the Sellers Agent shall not settle, resolve, or
abandon (and shall not allow the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries to
settle, resolve, or abandon) such Tax Contest without the prior written
permission of the Purchaser (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed) if such settlement, resolution, or abandonment could
result in the Company, any Subsidiary, or the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
incurring a Tax that is not an Indemnified Tax. 
---|---|--- 
 



-64- Purchaser shall pay fifty percent (50%) of all Transfer Taxes incurred in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder or
under the other Transaction Documents. 
---|---|--- 



     | (l) | The Purchaser will cause the Company and Protenergy to file
the election described in subsection 110(1.1) of the ITA (and undertake the
other procedures described therein) on a timely basis after the Closing Date
so that the Non-Seller Option Holders are not prohibited from claiming the
deduction under paragraph 110(1)(d) of the ITA in respect of the surrender of
their Options in accordance with the Option Cancellation Agreements. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (m) | Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any net
operating loss, non-capital loss or other Tax attribute or Tax credit of the
Company or the Companys Subsidiaries incurred in a Sellers Tax Period
and carried forward to a Purchaser Tax Period shall be for the sole benefit
of the Purchaser, but the Sellers do not warrant, and shall not be liable for
any reduction (for any reason including any action or event at any time from
execution of this Agreement through the Closing) in the amount of any such
carry forward, other than a reduction in any such carry forward as a result of
any action contemplated in Section 6.5.

the other of any fact or occurrence which any such party obtains knowledge
after the date hereof and which if existing and known at the date of this
Agreement would have been required to be set forth or disclosed in or
pursuant to this Agreement and which (if existing and known at any time prior
to or at the Closing) would make the performance by any party of a covenant
contained in this Agreement impossible, or which (if existing and known at
the time of the Closing) would cause a condition to any partys obligations
under this Agreement not to be fully satisfied. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | The Sellers will, as soon as reasonably practicable, advise
the Purchaser of any Knowledge of the Company of any fact or occurrence after
the date hereof or pending or threatened occurrence of which the Company

cancellation of, or a material adverse modification or change in, the

Section 11.6 Notice and Defense of Claims



     | (a) |

In the event that any Person shall incur or suffer any Losses in respect of
which indemnification may be sought by such Person pursuant to the provisions
of this Article 11 (including any Losses to which the Deductible is
applicable), the Person seeking to be indemnified hereunder (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") shall assert a claim for indemnification by written
notice to the Person from whom indemnification is 

---|---|--- 
 



-71- specificity the nature and basis of such claim (including the breach,
inaccuracy, non-performance or provision of the Agreement to which such claim
relates), a reasonable estimate of the amount of such claim and including
copies of all relevant pleadings and other demands (a " _Notice_ "). In the
case of Losses arising by reason of any third party claim, the Notice shall be
given within thirty (30) days of the filing or other written assertion of any
such claim against the Indemnified Party and in all other cases with
reasonable promptness, but the failure of the Indemnified Party to give the
Notice within such time period shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
liability that the Indemnifying Party may have to the Indemnified
Party unless the Indemnifying Party can demonstrate actual loss or prejudice
as a result of such failure. 
---|--- 



     | (b) | The Indemnified Party shall provide to the Indemnifying
Party on request all information and documentation reasonably necessary to
support and verify any Losses which the Indemnified Party believes give rise
to a claim for indemnification hereunder and shall give the Indemnifying
Party reasonable access to all premises, books, records and personnel in the
possession or under the control of the Indemnified Party which would have
bearing on such claim.  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

In the case of any third party claims for which indemnification is sought, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to
the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Notice,
to: (i) conduct and control (subject to the limitations set forth herein) at
its expense any proceedings or negotiations with such third party, (ii) take
steps to settle or defend any such claim (provided that the Indemnifying
Party shall not settle any such claim without the consent of the Indemnified
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) unless the settlement includes a complete and unconditional release
of the Indemnified Party with respect to the claim), (iii) employ counsel to
contest any such claim or liability; provided that the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to approve such counsel, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, and (iv) retain any consultant required to perform any
remediation required by Environmental Laws, provided that the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to approve such consultant and the proposed
remediation plan which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the
event the Indemnifying Party elects to conduct and control any proceedings
itself, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to fully participate at its
own cost and expense and by its own separate counsel in any proceedings
relating to any third-party claim, except that the Indemnifying Party shall
pay the costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (x) in the Indemnified
Partys good faith judgment, it is advisable, based on the advice of counsel,
for the Indemnified Party to be represented by separate counsel because a
conflict or potential conflict exists between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party or (y) the named parties to such third party claim include
both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified
Party determines in good faith, based on the advice of counsel, that defenses
are available to it that are unavailable to the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall, within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Notice
to Indemnifying Party (the " _Dispute Period_ "), notify the Indemnified Party
of its intention as to the conduct and control of the defense of such claim;
provided, 

---|---|--- 
 



-72- with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel. Until the Indemnified Party has
received notice of the Indemnifying Partys election whether to defend any
claim, the Indemnified Party shall take reasonable steps to defend (but may
not settle) such claim. If the Indemnifying Party shall decline to assume the
defense of any such claim, or the Indemnifying Party shall fail to notify the
Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period of the Indemnifying Partys
election to defend such claim, the Indemnified Party shall defend against such
claim (provided that the Indemnified Party shall not settle such claim without
the consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)). The expenses of all
proceedings, contests or lawsuits in respect of such claims shall be borne by
the Indemnifying Party but only if the Indemnifying Party is responsible
pursuant hereto to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of the third
party claim and, if applicable, only to the extent required by Section 11.3
and Section 11.5, as the case may be, and subject to the limitations of this
Section 11.6 and Section 11.7. Regardless of whether the Indemnified Party or
the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of the claim, the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party agree to cooperate fully with one another in
connection therewith and to keep each other reasonably informed of the status
of the claim and any related proceeding and the Indemnified Party shall take
no action or make any admissions or statements not required by
applicable Laws which would adversely affect the defense of any such claim. 
---|--- 



     | (d) | If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
that it does not dispute its liability to the Indemnified Party with respect
to any claim under this Article 11 or fails to notify the Indemnified
Party within the Dispute Period, the Losses arising from any such claim
shall, subject to the provisions of Section 11.3, Section 11.5 and Section
11.7, be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall, subject to the provisions of Section 11.3, Section
11.5 and Section 11.7, pay the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified Party on
demand following the final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Party
has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through
negotiations, either party may seek a resolution of such dispute by
litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | To the extent that there is an inconsistency between this
Section 11.6 and Section 8.3 as it relates to a Tax Claim or a Tax Contest,
the provisions of Section 8.3 shall govern. 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 11.7 Further Limitations and Qualifications on Indemnification



     | (a) | _Damages_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Indemnified Party shall have no right to indemnification with respect to
(i) any Losses to the extent not the reasonably foreseeable result of any
breach by the Indemnifying Party of a representation and warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement, or (ii) punitive or exemplary damages, unless
finally awarded to be payable to a third party by a court of competent
jurisdiction or related to any claim or cause of action for or based upon
fraud. 
---|---|--- 
 



-73- indemnification is provided under Section 11.2 or Section 11.4 gives rise to a
currently realizable Tax Savings (as defined below) to the Indemnified Party,
the indemnity payment shall be reduced by the amount of the Tax Savings
available to the Indemnified Party. To the extent such amount does not give
rise to a currently realizable Tax Savings, if such amount gives rise to a Tax
Savings to the Indemnified Party that are currently realizable (as defined
below) in any of the three (3) tax years following the payment of the amount,
such Indemnified Party shall refund to the Indemnifying Party the amount of
such Tax Savings when, as and if realized. For the purposes of this
Agreement, any subsequently realized Tax Savings in any of the three (3) years
following payment of the amount shall be treated as though it were a reduction
in the amount of the initial indemnity payment, and the Liabilities of the
parties shall be re-determined as though both occurred at or prior to the time
of the indemnity payment. For purposes of this Section 11.7(b), a " _Tax
Savings_ " means an amount by which the Tax liability of the Indemnified
Party (or Affiliates of or group of corporations including the Indemnified
Party) is reduced (including without limitation, by deduction, reduction of
income by virtue of increased tax basis or otherwise, entitlement to refund,
credit or otherwise) plus any related interest received from the relevant Tax
Governmental Authority. Where an Indemnified Party has other losses,
deductions, credits or items available to it, the Tax Savings from any losses,
deductions, credits or items relating to the indemnity payment shall be
deemed to be realized first before any other losses, deductions, credits or
items are realized. For the purposes of this Section 11.7(b), a Tax Savings is
"currently realizable" to the extent that such Tax Savings will actually be
realized in the current taxable period or year (including through a carryback
to a prior taxable period). In the event that there should be a determination
disallowing the Tax Savings, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable to refund
to the Indemnified Party the amount of any related reduction previously
allowed or payments previously made to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Section 11.7(b). The amount of the refunded reduction or payment shall be
deemed a payment under Section 11.6(d) of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

_Right to Recover_. The Indemnifying Party shall make any indemnification
payments determined to be payable to the Indemnified Party hereunder without
regard to any expectation that the Indemnified Party (including, for this
Section 11.7(c) in the case of the Purchaser, the Company and the Companys
Subsidiaries) will recover insurance proceeds or other amounts (whether
by payment, discount, credit, relief, insurance or otherwise) as a result of
the matter giving rise to the claim for which indemnification payments are to
be made. The Indemnified Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly seek to recover or make a claim for insurance proceeds or other
amounts available (including pursuant to any indemnification rights of the
Company or the Companys Subsidiaries under the Foodswing APA) as a result of
any matter giving rise to an indemnification claim of the Indemnified Party
against the Indemnifying Party. In addition, the Indemnifying Party shall, to
the extent of any indemnification 

---|---|--- 
 



-74- Indemnified Party against any third party in respect of the claim to which the
indemnification payment relates. If the Indemnified Party receives any
insurance proceeds or other amounts (including pursuant to any indemnification
rights of the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries under the Foodswing APA)
as a result of the matter giving rise to any indemnification claim of
the Indemnified Party prior to the date upon which the Indemnifying Party is
given notice of the claim, the Indemnifying Partys indemnification obligation
with respect to such claim shall be reduced by the amount of any such
insurance proceeds or other amounts (including any amounts recovered pursuant
to the exercise of any indemnification rights of the Company or the Companys
Subsidiaries under the Foodswing APA) actually received by the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnified Party receives any insurance proceeds or other
amounts (including any amounts recovered pursuant to the exercise of any
indemnification rights of the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries under the
Foodswing APA) as a result of the matter giving rise to any indemnification
claim of the Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party after the
Indemnifying Party has paid such indemnification claim to the Indemnified
Party, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly turn over any such
insurance proceeds or other amounts received to the Indemnifying Party to the
extent of the payments made by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party
on the claim. 
---|--- 



     | (d) | _Exclusive Remedies_. Subject to the rights of the Sellers
pursuant to Section 13.5, from and after Closing, except with respect to
matters covered by Section 2.6, the sole recourse and exclusive remedy of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties arising out
of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereunder or thereunder, whether based on tort, contract,
statutory or common law remedy or equitable remedy or otherwise, including
any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, non-fulfilment or failure to
perform and covenant or agreement or otherwise, shall be to assert a claim for
indemnification under the indemnification provisions of this Article 11 and
the Purchaser and the Sellers each covenant that it (and the Indemnified
Parties) will not seek to obtain any remedy except as provided in this Article
11, other than a claim of fraud. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section
11.7(d) shall not prohibit any party from obtaining any (i) injunctive relief
(including specific performance) if available with respect to any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or (ii) any other remedy available at
law or in equity as may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction. No
Person who was an officer, director, employee, limited partner, general
partner or shareholder (other than the Sellers in accordance with Article 11)
of any of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing shall have any liability in its capacity as officer, director,
employee or shareholder to make any payment in respect of any breach of any
representation or warranty or non-performance of any covenant or agreement
made in or pursuant to this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | _Duration of Claim_. The indemnification obligations of the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to a specific claim
for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement shall
extend beyond the time period for indemnification set forth herein with
respect to such specific claim until it has been fully discharged or resolved
or settled; _provided_ , _however_ , a Notice shall have been given to the
Indemnifying Party on or prior to the end of such time period. 
---|---|--- 
 



-75- take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Losses upon and after
becoming aware of any event, fact or circumstance which could reasonably be
expected to give rise to Losses. To the extent the Indemnified Party shall
fail to take such steps, then the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to
indemnify any Indemnified Party for the Losses that could have been avoided if
the Indemnified Party had taken such steps to mitigate the Losses. 
---|---|--- 

Section 11.8 Indemnification Adjustment to Purchase Price

 

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any amounts payable
under this Article 11 shall constitute an adjustment in the Purchase Price.

Section 13.3 Amendments and Waivers

No amendment to this Agreement may be made unless agreed to by the parties in
writing. The parties hereto may, by an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such party, waive compliance by any other party with any term or provision
of this Agreement that such other party was or is obligated to comply with or
perform. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial

 



-79-  exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. No waiver of any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed, or shall constitute, a waiver
of any other provision of this Agreement, whether or not similar, nor shall
such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly
provided.

 

Section 13.4 Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits



     | (a) | The Schedules shall be deemed to be attached hereto and made
a part hereof. All references herein to this Agreement shall include the
Schedules. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Nothing in the Schedules is intended to broaden the scope of
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement. The Schedules and
the information and disclosures contained therein are intended only to
qualify and limit the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
of the Sellers, the Company or the Purchaser, as the case may be, contained in
this Agreement and shall not be deemed to expand in any way the scope or
effect of any of such representations, warranties, covenants or agreements. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | The disclosure of any item in any Schedule (or section
thereof) shall be made with respect to the representation or warranty to which
it expressly relates, except to the extent it is reasonably apparent on the
face of such Schedules that such disclosure is applicable to other
representations or warranties. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in
any Schedule (or any section thereof) shall be construed as an admission or
indication that such item is required to be referred to or disclosed in
any Schedule (or any section thereof). Inclusion of any item in a Schedule
(or any section thereof) does not constitute a determination by the
representing party that such item is material and shall not be deemed to
establish a standard of materiality. No disclosure in a Schedule (or any
section thereof) relating to any possible breach or violation of any Contract,
Law or any potential adverse contingency shall be construed as an admission or
indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred
or that such adverse contingency will actually occur. 
---|---|--- 

Section 13.5 Disclaimer of Other Representations; Projections

The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties made by the Company or the Sellers expressly set forth in Article
3, Article 4 and the Transaction Documents, respectively, none of the Sellers,
the Company or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives has made,
and shall not be construed as having made, to the Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates or Representatives, any representation or warranty of any
kind, express or implied, written or oral, at law or in equity, in respect of
the Sellers, the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries, the Purchased
Stock or any of the assets, properties, liabilities, business, operations or
affairs of the Sellers, the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries,
including with respect to (i) merchantability or fitness for any particular
purpose, (ii) the operation of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries by
the Purchaser after the Closing, or (iii) the probable success or
profitability of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries after the Closing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser agrees that
(A) neither the Sellers, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives makes or has made any representation or

 



-80-  warranty to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Representatives with
respect to, and (B) other than the indemnification obligations set forth in
Article 11, none of the Sellers, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives shall have or be subject to any liability or
indemnification obligation to the Purchaser or to any other Person resulting
from the distribution to Purchaser or its Affiliates or Representatives of,
or the Purchasers use of:



     | (a) | any projections, financial models, estimates, forecasts or
budgets relating to the Business otherwise heretofore or hereafter delivered
to, presented to (including, for greater certainty, in any management
presentation) or made available to the Purchaser or its Representatives or
Affiliates; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | (any other information, statement or documents heretofore or
hereafter delivered to, presented to (including, for greater certainty, in any
management presentation) or made available to the Purchaser or
its Representatives or Affiliates, whether orally or in writing (including in
the "data room", functional "break-out" discussions, responses to questions
submitted on behalf of the Purchaser or otherwise), with respect to
the Sellers, the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries, the Purchased
Stock or any of the assets, properties, liabilities, business, operations or
affairs of the Sellers, the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries,
except to the extent and as expressly covered by a representation and
warranty contained in Article 3 or Article 4\. 
---|---|--- 

Section 13.6 Enforcement of Agreement

The parties agree that irreparable damage to the Sellers for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement (including the failure by any party to
take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents) was not performed in accordance with its specified terms or was
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Sellers shall be
entitled to an injunction or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in
any court of competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which the Sellers are entitled at Law or in equity, and any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the
obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief is hereby waived.

Section 13.7 Severability

 

Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in
such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law. If any
portion of this Agreement is declared invalid for any reason in any
jurisdiction, such declaration shall have no effect upon the remaining
portions of this Agreement which shall continue in full force and effect as if
this Agreement had been executed with the invalid portions thereof deleted;
provided, however, if such severability will negate in any material respect
the monetary terms of this Agreement, then the parties shall negotiate in good
faith to amend the invalid terms in a manner so that such terms shall not be
invalid and will not modify in any material respect the monetary terms of this
Agreement unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Furthermore, the entirety
of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in all other
jurisdictions.

 



-81- Section 13.8 Entire Understanding

 

This Agreement, including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto, and the other
Transaction Documents sets forth the entire agreement and understanding
between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes
any and all prior discussions, negotiations, letters of intent or agreements
in principle between them, other than the Confidentiality Agreement which
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms.

Section 13.9 Binding Effect; No Third Party Beneficiaries 

Except for the provisions of Article 11 relating to the Seller Indemnified
Parties and Purchaser Indemnified Parties, Section 7.3 relating to the
Directors and Officers and Section 8.3(l) relating to a tax election to be
filed after Closing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the exclusive benefit of the parties and their respective heirs, executors,
administrators, legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns and
nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to, nor shall it, confer in
any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. The parties agree
that, for the purpose of giving enforceable rights under this Agreement: (i)
to the Seller Indemnified Parties who are not party to this Agreement, the
Sellers Agent is contracting as the agent of such Persons and will hold the
rights of such Persons in trust for them, (ii) to the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties who are not party to this Agreement, the Purchaser is contracting as
the agent of such Persons and will hold the rights of such Persons in trust
for them, (iii) the Directors and Officers who are not party to this
Agreement, the Sellers Agent is contracting as the agent of such Persons and
will hold the rights of such Persons in trust for them, and (iv) the Non-
Seller Option Holders who are not party to this Agreement, the Sellers Agent
is contracting as the agent of such Persons and will hold the rights of such
Persons in trust for them.

 

Section 13.10 Governing Law

This Agreement is and shall be deemed to be a contract entered into and made
pursuant to the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada
applicable therein and shall in all respects be governed, construed, applied
and enforced in accordance with said laws, without reference to applicable
conflict of laws rules or principles.

Section 13.11 Choice of Forum and Consent to Jurisdiction 

Any action arising out of or under this Agreement, any other document,
instrument or agreement contemplated herein or delivered pursuant hereto, or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents or any of such other documents, instruments or agreements shall be
brought only in a federal or provincial court having jurisdiction and venue
in the Province of Ontario, Canada and each of the parties hereby irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and agrees that venue in
the Province of Ontario is proper. To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
final judgment against such party (a certified copy of which shall be
conclusive evidence of the fact and of the amount of any indebtedness of such
party hereunder) in any such legal action or proceeding shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on an unsatisfied judgment
or similar proceeding. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably waives and
agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise, in any
legal action or proceeding, any defense or any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any
reason, including claims that such party may be immune from the

 



-82-  above-described legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment
prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, or otherwise), or that such
proceeding is brought in an inconvenient or otherwise improper forum or that
this Agreement or any of the other aforementioned documents, instruments or
agreements, or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced in or
by such courts, or that the same are governed by the laws of a jurisdiction
other than the Province of Ontario. Each of the parties hereby specifically
agrees that it shall not bring any actions, suits or proceedings arising out
of or under this Agreement, any other document, instrument or agreement
contemplated herein or delivered pursuant hereto, or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or any of such
other documents, instruments or agreements, in the courts of any jurisdiction
other than the above-named courts of the Province of Ontario, that any such
action brought by any party shall be dismissed upon the basis of the
agreements, terms and provisions set forth in this Section 13.11, and that any
order or judgment obtained in any such action from a court other than the
courts of the Province of Ontario, Canada, shall be void _ab initio_ ;
provided, that, for greater certainty, the foregoing shall not prevent any
party from bringing an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to
enforce a judgment rendered in any federal or provincial court having
jurisdiction and venue in the Province of Ontario, Canada.

 

Section 13.12 Waiver of Trial by Jury

 

EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
LAW, ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM, SUIT, LITIGATION,
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION
DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. THE PARTIES
AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PROVISION WITH ANY COURT AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED FOR AGREEMENT BETWEEN
THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY, AND THAT SUCH PROCEEDING
WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM SHALL INSTEAD BE TRIED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT
JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

Section 13.13 Assignability

 



     | (a) | Except as set forth below, no party hereto shall sell,
pledge, assign or otherwise transfer its rights under this Agreement without
the prior written consent of the other parties and any attempt to do so shall
be void.  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The Purchaser may, without the consent of the other parties
hereto (i) assign its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement
to any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, if such subsidiary delivers to
the Sellers an instrument in writing that it is bound by and shall perform
the obligations of the Purchaser under this Agreement as if it were an
original signatory hereto or (ii) assign its rights or interests under this
Agreement as collateral to any financial or lending institution providing
financing to the Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereunder; _provided_ , that, in each case, no such assignment shall release
the Purchaser from any of its obligations hereunder. In the event of an
assignment contemplated by this Section 13.13(b), any reference in this
Agreement to the "Purchaser" shall be deemed to include its subsidiary
transferee. 
---|---|--- 
 



-83- Section 13.14 Counterparts; Delivery by Electronic Transmission

 

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (including by facsimile or
other means of electronic transmission, such as by electronic mail in " _pdf_
" form), all of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and
all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement
by facsimile transmission or other electronic transmission shall be as
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 

Section 13.15 Public Announcements

 

No public announcements or other publicity (including any communication to
employees, customers or suppliers of the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries) regarding the transactions referred to herein shall be made by
the Purchaser, the Sellers, the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries
at any time prior to the Closing without the prior written consent of
the other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) as to form, content, timing and manner of distribution
or publication, except (i) that any party may make any public disclosure to
the extent it believes in good faith that it is required by applicable Law or
any listing or trading agreement or the rules and regulations of any
securities exchange or automated securities quotation system concerning its
publicly-traded securities (in which case the disclosing Party will, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, any such listing or trading agreement,
rules or regulations, use its commercially reasonable efforts to advise the
other Party prior to making the disclosure, deliver a copy of such proposed
disclosure to the other party (and accept any reasonable comments provided by
such other party) and use commercially reasonable efforts to seek confidential
treatment of such disclosure), and (ii) each party may disclose to its
current and prospective banks, shareholders, partners, investors and advisors
the name of the other party, the date of the transaction, the price and the
key terms under this Agreement. If the Purchaser is required by applicable Law
or any listing or trading agreement or the rules and regulations of any
securities exchange to file a copy of the Disclosure Schedules or other
schedules on EDGAR or in any other manner in which it could be access by the
public, the Purchaser shall redact all personal information and commercially
sensitive information of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries after
consulting in good faith with the Sellers. The parties shall also obtain the
other parties prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) of any press release to be issued
immediately following (i) the execution of this Agreement and (ii) the Closing
announcing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

Section 13.16 Appointment of Sellers Agent

 



     | (a) | By execution of this Agreement, each Seller has appointed
the Sellers Agent as its true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact such that
Sellers Agent has the authority, for and on behalf of such Seller, to take

pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and
any related document or instrument, and any such actions shall be binding on
such Seller, including, without limitation, the following: 
---|---|--- 
 



-84- on behalf of such Seller, securities powers, assignment agreements and the
certificates representing the Purchased Stock held by such Seller, and any
other documents relating thereto;

     | (v) | to receive payments on behalf of such Seller due and owing
pursuant to this Agreement and acknowledge receipt thereof;

Transaction Documents, or waive any provision hereof or thereof, provided that
such amendment, supplement, change or waiver applies to all Sellers;

     | (vii) | to receive service of process on behalf of such Seller in
connection with any claims under this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents or any related document or instrument;

---|---|--- 



     | (ix) | to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the
judgment of Sellers Agent to accomplish any of the foregoing. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Each Seller agrees that upon payment of the Purchase Price
being made to the Sellers Agent for such Sellers Purchased Stock in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, all right,
title, benefit and interest of such Seller in such Purchased Stock shall be
deemed to have been transferred to the Purchaser and the Purchaser shall be
entitled to have such shares registered in its name in the registry of the
Company even where such Seller fails to deliver at closing the certificates,
if applicable, representing such Sellers Purchased Stock, or other document
otherwise contemplated herein to be delivered at Closing by such Seller. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) |

The Sellers Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted to be taken
as Sellers Agent except expressly as set forth herein. By execution of this
Agreement, each Seller shall have and shall be deemed to have agreed that the
Sellers shall severally and not jointly and severally indemnify and hold
harmless the Sellers Agent and its partners, shareholders,
Affiliates, directors, officers, fiduciaries, employees and agents and each
of the partners, shareholders, Affiliates, directors, officers, fiduciaries,
employees and agents of each of the foregoing (each a " _Agent Indemnified
Party_ ") from and against all losses, liabilities, claims or expenses 

---|---|--- 
 



-85- result of, or arising out of, or relating to any and all actions taken or
omitted to be taken by the Sellers Agent under this Agreement or in
connection with the incurrence, payment, discharge or settlement of any of the
obligations of the Sellers, except for any such losses, liabilities, claims or
expenses that arise on account of the Sellers Agents fraud, gross
negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final adjudication. None of the Agent Indemnified Parties
shall be liable to any Seller in respect of such arrangements or actions or
omissions in connection therewith, except to the extent that such acts or
omissions constitute fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct. A
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers Agent shall constitute a
decision for all Sellers hereunder, and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each Seller and the Purchaser and the Company may rely upon
any such decision, act, consent or instruction of Sellers Agent as being the
decision, act, consent or instruction of such Seller and treat such Sellers
Agent as the duly appointed attorney-in-fact of each Seller and as having the
duties, power and authority provided for in this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. The Purchaser and the Company are hereby relieved from any
liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers Agent. 
---|--- 



     | (d) | The Sellers Agent shall be entitled (x) at any time and
from time to time to reimbursement from the Sellers for any Sellers Agent
Expenses and (y) to withhold any amounts from the proceeds delivered to it
under Section 2.3(iv) as it deems reasonably necessary to satisfy any
adjustments contemplated by Section 2.7 and to establish a reasonable reserve
for potential Sellers Agent Expenses; it being understood that following the
determination of such adjustment, the Sellers Agent shall pay to the Sellers
their Pro Rata Share of any amounts not paid to the Purchaser pursuant
thereto. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | The Sellers Agent will at all times be entitled to rely on
any directions received from the Sellers (acting by an affirmative vote of the
Sellers whose aggregate Pro Rata Share immediately prior to the date
hereof was greater than 50%); provided, however, that the Sellers Agent
shall not be required to follow any such direction, and shall be under no
obligation to take any action in its capacity as the Sellers Agent, unless
the Sellers Agent has been provided with the funds, security or indemnities
which, in the sole determination of the Sellers Agent, are sufficient to
protect the Sellers Agent against the costs, expenses and liabilities which
may be incurred by the Sellers Agent in responding to such direction or
taking such action. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | If the Sellers Agent becomes unable to serve as Sellers
Agent, such other Person or Persons may be designated by the Sellers (acting
by an affirmative vote of the Sellers whose aggregate Pro Rata
Share immediately prior to the date hereof was greater than 50%), and such
Person or Persons shall succeed as Sellers Agent. 
---|---|--- 



     | (g) |

Any notice given to the Sellers Agent hereunder in accordance with Section
13.2 or under the Escrow Agreement will constitute notice to each and all of
the Sellers at the time notice is given to the Sellers Agent (other than
notice to a Seller for service of process relating to a Legal Proceeding
before a court or other tribunal of  

---|---|--- 
 



-86- Seller individual, as applicable). Any action taken by, or notice or
instruction received from, the Sellers Agent hereunder in accordance with
Section 13.2 or under the Escrow Agreement will be deemed to be action by, or
notice or instruction from, each and all of the Sellers. The Purchaser and the
Company may, and the Escrow Agent will, disregard any notice or instruction
received from any one or more individual Sellers, other than the Sellers
Agent. 
---|--- 



     | (h) | The Sellers Agent shall have the discretion to take such
action as the Sellers Agent shall determine to be in the best interests of
all of the Sellers; provided, however, that in any event, all Sellers
are treated in a substantially proportionate manner. 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the
Sellers Agent under this Agreement shall survive the termination of this
Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 13.17 Mutual Drafting

The parties hereto are sophisticated and have been represented by lawyers who
have carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a consequence, the parties
do not intend that the presumptions of any laws or rules relating to the
interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any particular clause
should be applied to this Agreement and therefore waive their effects.

Section 13.18 Legal Representation

The Purchaser, the Sellers and the Company hereby agree, on their own behalf
and on behalf of their directors, shareholders, members, partners, officers,
employees and Affiliates, and each of their successors and assigns (all such
parties, the " _Waiving Parties_ "), that (i) Goodmans LLP may represent any
of the Sellers and each of their Affiliates, other than the Company and
Companys Subsidiaries (individually and collectively, the " _Seller Group_
"), on the one hand, and the Company and Companys Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the other documents contemplated hereunder and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder or under the other
Transaction Documents (such representation, the " _Current Representation_
"), and (ii) Goodmans LLP (or any successor) may represent the Seller Group or
any member of the Seller Group or any director, shareholder, partner, officer,
employee or Affiliate of the Seller Group or any member of the Seller Group,
other than the Company and Companys Subsidiaries, in each case in connection
with any dispute, litigation, claim, proceeding or obligation arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the other
documents contemplated hereunder and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereunder or under the other Transaction Documents (any such
representation, the " _Post-Closing Representation_ ") notwithstanding such
representation (or any continued representation) of the Company or Companys
Subsidiaries, and each of the Purchaser and the Company on behalf of itself
and the Waiving Parties hereby consents thereto and irrevocably waives (and
will not assert) any conflict of interest or any objection arising therefrom
or relating thereto. Each of the Purchaser and the Company acknowledge that
the foregoing provision applies whether or not Goodmans LLP provides legal
services to either of the Company or any of Companys Subsidiaries after the
Closing Date. Each of the Purchaser and the Company, for itself and the
Waiving Parties, hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all
communications between the Seller Group and their counsel, including Goodmans
LLP, made in

 



-87-  connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and
performance under, or any dispute or proceeding arising out of or relating to,
this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the other documents
contemplated hereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereunder or under the other Transaction Documents, or any matter relating to
any of the foregoing, are privileged communications between the Seller Group
and such counsel and none of the Purchaser, the Company, or any Person
purporting to act on behalf of or through the Purchaser or the Company or any
of the Waiving Parties, will seek to obtain the same by any process. From and
after the Closing, each of the Purchaser and the Company, on behalf of itself
and the Waiving Parties, waives and will not assert any attorney-client
privilege with respect to any communication between Goodmans LLP and the
Company or any Person in the Seller Group occurring during the Current
Representation in connection with any Post-Closing Representation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 13.18, neither the
Sellers Agent nor any Seller may assert (or cause to be asserted on their
behalf) the attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication that
reflects any fraud with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder or
under the other Transaction Documents. Further, in the event that a dispute
arises between the Purchaser, the Company or any of Companys Subsidiaries and
a third party other than a party to this Agreement after the Closing, the
Company and Companys Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client privilege
to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Goodmans LLP (or any
successors), the Sellers Agent or any of Sellers to such third party;
provided, however, that the Company and Companys Subsidiaries may not waive
such privilege without the prior written consent of the Sellers Agent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
