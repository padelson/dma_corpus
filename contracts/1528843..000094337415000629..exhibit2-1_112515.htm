reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the Closing,
neither MainSource nor any of its Affiliates shall knowingly take any action,
cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to
fail to be taken, which action or failure to act could cause the Merger to

subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX, prior
to the Effective Time, MainSource shall be entitled to revise the structure of
the Merger described in Section 2.1 hereof, provided that (i) such
modification does not prevent the rendering of the opinions contemplated by
Sections 9.2.5 and 9.3.5; (ii) the consideration to be paid to the holders of
Cheviot Financial Common Stock under this Agreement is not thereby changed in
kind, value or reduced in amount; and (iii) such modification will not delay
materially or jeopardize receipt of any required Regulatory Approvals or other
consents and approvals relating to the consummation of the Merger. The parties
hereto agree to appropriately amend this Agreement and any related documents
in order to reflect any such revised structure.

  

  

2.8. Additional Actions.

acts are necessary or desirable to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or

ARTICLE III

  

  

CONVERSION OF SHARES

  

  

3.1. Conversion of Cheviot Financial Common Stock; Merger Consideration.

  

  

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of MainSource, Cheviot Financial or the holders of any of the shares of
Cheviot Financial Common Stock, the Merger shall be effected in accordance
with the following terms:

  

  

3.1.1. Each share of MainSource Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding
following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

  

  

3.1.2. Each share of Non-Fiduciary Stock shall, at the Effective Time, cease
to exist, and the certificates for such shares shall be canceled as promptly
as practicable thereafter, and no payment or distribution shall be made in
consideration therefor.

  

  

3.1.3. Each share of Cheviot Financial Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Non-Fiduciary Stock) shall
become and be converted into, as provided in and subject to the limitations
set forth in this Agreement, the right to receive at the election of the
holder thereof as provided in Section 3.2 either (i) $15.00 in cash, without
interest (the "Per Share Cash Consideration"); or (ii) 0.6916 shares (the
"Exchange Ratio") of MainSource Common Stock (the "Per Share Stock
Consideration"). The Per Share Cash Consideration and the Per Share Stock
Consideration are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the "Merger
Consideration."

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

3.1.4. After the Effective Time, shares of Cheviot Financial Common Stock
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and shall thereafter by operation of this section have no
rights except the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

  

  

3.1.5. In the event MainSource changes (or establishes a record date for
changing) the number of, or provides for the exchange of, shares of MainSource
Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of
a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, or similar
transaction with respect to the outstanding MainSource Common Stock and the
record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio
shall be proportionately and appropriately adjusted; provided, that no such
adjustment shall be made with regard to MainSource Common Stock if MainSource
issues additional shares of MainSource Common Stock and receives fair market
value consideration for such shares.

  

  

3.1.6. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of MainSource Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates. In lieu
of the issuance of any such fractional share, MainSource shall pay to each
former holder of Cheviot Financial Common Stock who otherwise would be
entitled to receive a fractional share of MainSource Common Stock, an amount
in cash, rounded to the nearest cent and without interest, equal to the
product of (i) the fraction of a share to which such holder would otherwise
have been entitled and (ii) the average of the daily closing sales prices of a
share of MainSource Common Stock as reported on NASDAQ for the ten (10)
consecutive trading days ending on the third business day preceding the
Closing Date. For purposes of determining any fractional share interest, all
shares of Cheviot Financial Common Stock owned by a Cheviot Financial
stockholder shall be combined so as to calculate the maximum number of whole
shares of MainSource Common Stock issuable to such Cheviot Financial
stockholder.

  

  

3.2. Election Procedures.

  

  

3.2.1. In the aggregate, fifty percent (50.0%) of the total number of shares
of Cheviot Financial Common Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective Time
(excluding any Non-Fiduciary Stock (the "Stock Conversion Number")), shall be
converted into the Per Share Stock Consideration and the remaining outstanding
shares of Cheviot Financial Common Stock shall be converted into the Per Share
Cash Consideration. Shares of Cheviot Financial Common Stock as to which a
Cash Election (including, as part of a Mixed Election) has been made are
referred to herein as "Cash Election Shares." Shares of Cheviot Financial
Common Stock as to which a Stock Election has been made (including, as part of
a Mixed Election) are referred to as "Stock Election Shares." Shares of
Cheviot Financial Common Stock as to which no election has been made (or as to
which an Election Form is not timely returned or not properly completed) are

Cheviot Financial Common Stock with respect to which a Stock Election has been
made is referred to herein as the "Stock Election Number."

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

3.2.2. An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal
materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon timely and proper
delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent), in such form as Cheviot
Financial and MainSource shall mutually agree ("Election Form"), shall be
mailed not less than 20 business days but not more than 40 business days prior
to the anticipated Effective Time or on such other date as MainSource and
Cheviot Financial shall mutually agree (the "Mailing Date") to each holder of
record of Cheviot Financial Common Stock as of five business days prior to the
Mailing Date, or such other date as the parties shall agree (the "Election
Form Record Date"). Each Election Form shall permit such holder, subject to
the allocation and election procedures set forth in this Section 3.2, (i) to
elect to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration for all of the shares of
Cheviot Financial Common Stock held by such holder (a "Cash Election"), (ii)
to elect to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration for all of the shares of
Cheviot Financial Common Stock held by such holder (a "Stock Election"), (iii)
elect to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration for a portion of such
holder's Cheviot Financial Common Stock and the Per Share Cash Consideration
for the remaining portion of such holder's Cheviot Financial Common Stock (the
"Cash/Stock Consideration") (an election to receive the Cash/Stock
Consideration is referred to as a "Mixed Election"), or (iv) to indicate that
such record holder has no preference as to the receipt of the Per Share Cash
Consideration or the Per Share Stock Consideration for such shares of Cheviot
Financial Common Stock (a "Non-Election"). A holder of record of shares of
Cheviot Financial Common Stock who holds such shares as nominee, trustee or in
another representative capacity (a "Representative") may submit multiple
Election Forms, provided that each such Election Form covers all the shares of
Cheviot Financial Common Stock held by such Representative for a particular
beneficial owner. Any shares of Cheviot Financial Common Stock with respect to
which the holder thereof shall not, as of the Election Deadline, have made an
election by submission to the Exchange Agent of an effective, properly
completed Election Form shall be deemed Non-Election Shares.

  

  

3.2.3. To be effective, a properly completed Election Form shall be submitted
to the Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the 20th
calendar day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as
MainSource and Cheviot Financial may mutually agree) (the "Election
Deadline"); provided, however, that the Election Deadline may not occur on or
after the Closing Date. Cheviot Financial shall make available Election Forms
to persons who become holders (or beneficial owners) of Cheviot Financial
Common Stock between the Election Form Record Date and the close of business
on the business day prior to the Election Deadline. Cheviot Financial shall
provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to
perform as specified herein. An election shall have been properly made only if
the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election
Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly
completed only if accompanied by one or more Certificates (or customary
affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such
Certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such Certificates) representing all
shares of Cheviot Financial Common Stock covered by such Election Form,
together with duly executed transmittal materials included with the Election
Form. If a Cheviot Financial stockholder either (i) does not submit a properly
completed Election Form in a timely fashion or (ii) revokes its Election Form
prior to the Election Deadline without submitting a properly completed
replacement Election Form, the shares of Cheviot Financial Common Stock held
by such stockholder shall be designated as Non-Election Shares. Any Election
Form may be revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form to
the Exchange Agent by written notice to the Exchange Agent only if such notice
of revocation or change is actually received by the Exchange Agent at or prior
to the Election Deadline. MainSource shall cause the Certificate or
Certificates relating to any revoked Election Form to be promptly returned
without charge to the person submitting the Election Form to the Exchange
Agent. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the
Exchange Agent shall have discretion to determine when any election,

3.2.4. If the Stock Election Number exceeds the Stock Conversion Number, then
all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, and, subject to Section
3.1.6 hereof, each holder of Stock Election Shares will be entitled to receive
the Per Share Stock Consideration only with respect to that number of Stock
Election Shares held by such holder equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the Stock Conversion Number and the
denominator of which is the Stock Election Number, with the remaining number
of such holder's Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Cash Consideration.

  

  

3.2.5. If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion Number
(the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds the Stock Election
Number being referred to herein as the "Shortfall Number"), then all Stock
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Cash Election Shares shall
be treated in the following manner:

  

  

(A) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration and, subject to Section
3.1.6 hereof, each holder of Non-Election Shares shall receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares held by
such holder equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of
Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of
which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the total number
of Non-Election Shares, with the remaining number of such holder's Non-
Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration; or

  

  

(B) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then
all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Stock Consideration, and, subject to Section 3.1.6 hereof, each holder
of Cash Election Shares shall receive the Per Share Stock Consideration in
respect of that number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares
held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by
which (1) the Shortfall Number exceeds (2) the total number of Non-Election
Shares and the denominator of which is the total number of Cash Election
Shares, with the remaining number of such holder's Cash Election Shares being
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration.

3.3. Procedures for Exchange of Cheviot Financial Common Stock.

  

  

3.3.1. MainSource to Make Merger Consideration Available. No later than the
business day prior to the Closing Date, MainSource shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders
of Cheviot Financial Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this
Section 3.3, certificates representing the shares of MainSource Common Stock,
or at MainSource's option, evidence of shares in book entry form, and an
aggregate amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash
payable pursuant to this Article III (including the estimated amount of cash
to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Cheviot Financial Common Stock)
(such cash and certificates for shares of MainSource Common Stock, together
with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto (without any interest
thereon) being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund").

  

  

3.3.2. Exchange of Certificates. MainSource shall take all steps necessary to
cause the Exchange Agent, within five (5) business days after the Effective
Time, to mail to each holder of a Certificate or Certificates who has not
previously surrendered such Certificates with an Election Form a letter of
transmittal for return to the Exchange Agent and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the Cheviot
Financial Common Stock represented by such Certificates shall have been
converted as a result of the Merger if any. The letter of transmittal (which
shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Cheviot Financial) shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter
of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration to which
such holder of Cheviot Financial Common Stock shall have become entitled
pursuant to Section 3.1.3 hereof, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Per Share
Cash Consideration or any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares or any
unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of
Certificates.

  

  

3.3.3. Rights of Holders of Certificates after the Effective Time. The holder
of a Certificate that prior to the Merger represented issued and outstanding
Cheviot Financial Common Stock shall have no rights, after the Effective Time,
with respect to such Cheviot Financial Common Stock except to surrender the
Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided in this
Agreement. No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective
Time with respect to MainSource Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.3. After the surrender of a
Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.3, the record holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions,
without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with
respect to shares of MainSource Common Stock represented by such Certificate.

  

  

3.3.4. Surrender by Persons Other than Record Holders. If the Person
surrendering a Certificate and signing the accompanying letter of transmittal
is not the record holder thereof, then it shall be a condition of the payment
of the Merger Consideration that: (i) such Certificate is properly endorsed to
such Person or is accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case
signed exactly as the name of the record holder appears on such Certificate,
and is otherwise in proper form for transfer, or is accompanied by appropriate
evidence of the authority of the Person surrendering such Certificate and
signing the letter of transmittal to do so on behalf of the record holder; and
(ii) the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in
advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

3.3.5. Closing of Transfer Books. The stock transfer books of Cheviot
Financial shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time. From and after
the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of
Cheviot Financial of the Cheviot Financial Common Stock that was outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the
Exchange Agent, they shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration and
canceled as provided in this Section 3.3.

  

  

3.3.6. Return of Exchange Fund. At any time following the twelve (12) month
period after the Effective Time, MainSource shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portions of the Exchange Fund which had
been made available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed to holders of
Certificates (including, without limitation, all interest and other income
received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all funds made available to it),
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to MainSource (subject
to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) with respect to any
Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither MainSource
nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for any
Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Certificate to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.

  

  

3.3.7. Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof.

  

  

3.3.8. Withholding. MainSource or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of Cheviot
Financial Common Stock such amounts as MainSource or the Exchange Agent are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or
non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such amounts are properly withheld by
MainSource or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Cheviot Financial Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding were made by MainSource or the Exchange Agent.

as allowed under the Cheviot Financial Stock Plans.

4.6.3. Cheviot Financial and each Cheviot Financial Subsidiary has timely
filed all reports, forms, schedules, registrations, statements and other
documents, together with any amendments required to be made with respect
thereto, that it was required to file since December 31, 2014 with any
Governmental Entity and has paid all fees and assessments due and payable in
connection therewith. The Cheviot Financial Regulatory Reports, to the extent
they contain financial information, have been prepared in all material
respects in accordance with applicable regulatory accounting principles and
practices throughout the periods covered by such statements.

  

  

4.6.4. None of Cheviot Financial or any Cheviot Financial Subsidiaries'
records, systems, controls, data or information are recorded, stored,
maintained, operated or otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or held by any
means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) which (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom) are not under the exclusive ownership and direct control of it or
the Cheviot Financial Subsidiary or accountants except in the ordinary course
of business or as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Cheviot Financial. Cheviot
Financial (x) has implemented and maintains a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as required by Rule 13a-15(a) of the Exchange Act) that
is designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of its financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP and to provide reasonable assurances
that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or
specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and to maintain
accountability for assets and (iii) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with management's general or specific authorization, (y) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to Cheviot Financial, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is
made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of
Cheviot Financial by others within those entities, and (z) has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Cheviot
Financial's outside auditors and the audit committee of the Cheviot Financial
Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Cheviot Financial's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Cheviot
Financial's internal control over financial reporting. These disclosures (if
any) were made in writing by management to Cheviot Financial's auditors and
audit committee and a copy has previously been made available to MainSource.
As of the date hereof, Cheviot Financial has no reason to believe that its
outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer
will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant
to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

25  

  

 

 

 

  

4.6.5. Since December 31, 2014, (A) neither Cheviot Financial nor any Cheviot
Financial Subsidiary nor, to its Knowledge, any director, officer, employee,
auditor, accountant or representative of Cheviot Financial or any Cheviot
Financial Subsidiary has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of Cheviot Financial or any Cheviot Financial
Subsidiary or their respective internal accounting controls, including any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Cheviot Financial or
any Cheviot Financial Subsidiary has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices, and (B) no attorney representing Cheviot Financial or any
Cheviot Financial Subsidiary, whether or not employed by Cheviot Financial or
any Cheviot Financial Subsidiary, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
it or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to its Board of
Directors or any committee thereof or to any of its directors or officers.

  

  

4.6.6. Cheviot Financial has filed all reports, schedules, registration
statements, prospectuses, and other documents, together with all amendments
thereto, required to be filed with the SEC since December 31, 2014 (the
"Cheviot Financial Reports"). As of their respective dates of filing with the
SEC (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the date
hereof, as of the date of such subsequent filing), the Cheviot Financial
Reports complied, and each Cheviot Financial Report filed subsequent to the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time will comply, in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"),
and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as amended
(the "Dodd-Frank Act"), and did not or will not, as the case may be, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. There
are no outstanding comments from, or unresolved issues raised by, the SEC with
respect to any of the Cheviot Financial Reports. None of the Cheviot Financial
Subsidiaries is required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to
Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. No executive officer of Cheviot
Financial has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him
or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and to the Knowledge
of Cheviot Financial no enforcement action has been initiated by the SEC
against Cheviot Financial or its officers or directors relating to disclosures
contained in any Cheviot Financial Report.

Schedule 4.7, Cheviot Financial and the Cheviot Financial Subsidiaries have
not executed an extension or waiver of any statute of limitations on the

or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or
other third party, and Cheviot Financial and each Cheviot Financial
Subsidiary, to the Knowledge of Cheviot Financial, has timely complied with
all applicable information reporting requirements under Part III, Subchapter A
of Chapter 61 of the Code and similar applicable state and local information
reporting requirements. Since December 31, 2014, through and including the

delinquent in the payment of any amount due pursuant to any trade payable in
any material respect, and each has properly accrued for such payables in

thereunder. Except as set forth in Cheviot Financial Disclosure Schedule
4.9.3, no such agreement, plan, contract, or arrangement (i) provides for
acceleration in the vesting of benefits or payments due thereunder upon the

maintained by MainSource or any MainSource Subsidiary in which any employee or
former employee, consultant or former consultant or director or former
director

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

participates or to which any such employee, consultant or director is a party
or is otherwise entitled to receive benefits (the "MainSource Compensation and
Benefit Plans") has been operated and administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and, in all material respects, with applicable law,
including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA, HIPAA and any
regulations or rules promulgated thereunder, and all material filings,
disclosures and notices required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA and HIPAA and
any other applicable law have been timely made or any interest, fines,
penalties or other impositions for late filings have been paid in full. Each
MainSource Compensation and Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit
plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA and which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received or has requested and
expects to receive a favorable determination or opinion letter from the IRS,
or is entitled to rely on a determination letter issued to the sponsor or a
master or prototype plan, and MainSource is not aware of any circumstances
which are reasonably likely to result in revocation of any such favorable
determination or opinion letter. There is no material pending or, to the
Knowledge of MainSource, threatened action, suit or claim relating to any of
the MainSource Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for
benefits). Neither MainSource nor any MainSource Subsidiary has engaged in a
transaction, or omitted to take any action, with respect to any MainSource
Compensation and Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject
MainSource or any MainSource Subsidiary to a material unpaid tax or penalty
imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

  

  

5.12.3 Except as set forth in MainSource Disclosure Schedule 5.12.3, no
liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by MainSource or any
MainSource Subsidiary with respect to any MainSource Compensation and Benefit
Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA ("MainSource Pension Plan")
currently or formerly maintained by MainSource or any entity which is
considered one employer with MainSource under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or
Section 414 of the Code (an "MainSource ERISA Affiliate") since the effective
date of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full, and, to the Knowledge of
MainSource, no condition exists that presents a material risk to MainSource or
any MainSource ERISA Affiliate of incurring a liability under such Title. No
MainSource Pension Plan had an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in
Section 302 of ERISA), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the end of
the most recent plan year ending prior to the date hereof; the fair market
value of the assets of each MainSource Pension Plan exceeds the present value
of the "benefit liabilities" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA)
under such MainSource Pension Plan as of the end of the most recent plan year
with respect to the respective MainSource Pension Plan ending prior to the
date hereof, calculated on the basis of the actuarial assumptions used in the
most recent actuarial valuation for such MainSource Pension Plan as of the
date hereof; there is not currently pending with the PBGC any filing with
respect to any reportable event under Section 4043 of ERISA nor has any
reportable event occurred as to which a filing is required and has not been
made (other than as might be required with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby). Neither MainSource nor any MainSource
ERISA Affiliate has contributed to any "multiemployer plan," as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA. Neither MainSource, nor, to the Knowledge of
MainSource, any MainSource ERISA Affiliate, nor any MainSource Compensation
and Benefit Plan, including any MainSource Pension Plan, nor any trust created
thereunder, nor, to the knowledge of MainSource, any trustee or administrator
thereof has engaged in a transaction in connection with which MainSource, any
MainSource ERISA Affiliate, and any MainSource Compensation and Benefit Plan,
including any MainSource Pension Plan or any such trust or any trustee or
administrator thereof, would reasonably be expected to be subject to either a
material civil liability or penalty pursuant to Section 409, 502(i) or 502(l)
of ERISA or a material tax imposed pursuant to Chapter 43 of the Code.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

5.12.4 All material contributions required to be made under the terms of any
MainSource Compensation and Benefit Plan have been timely made, and all
anticipated contributions and funding obligations have been accrued on
MainSource's consolidated financial statements to the extent required by and
in accordance with GAAP. MainSource and each of its Subsidiaries has expensed
and accrued as a liability the present value of future benefits under each
applicable MainSource Compensation and Benefit Plan for financial reporting
purposes in accordance with applicable laws and GAAP.

  

  

5.12.5 [intentionally omitted].

  

  

5.12.6 With respect to each MainSource Compensation and Benefit Plan, if
applicable, MainSource has provided or made available to Cheviot Financial
copies of the: (A) trust instruments and insurance contracts; (B) two most
recent annual reports or IRS Form 5500; (C) two most recent actuarial reports
and financial statements; (D) most recent summary plan description; (E) most
recent determination or opinion letter issued by the IRS; (F) any Form 5310 or
Form 5330 filed with the IRS within the last three years; and (G) most recent
nondiscrimination tests performed under ERISA and the Code (including 401(k)
and 401(m) tests).

  

  

5.12.7 Except as set forth in MainSource Disclosure Schedule 5.12.7, neither
MainSource nor any MainSource Subsidiary maintains any compensation plans,
programs or arrangements under which any payment is reasonably likely to
become non-deductible, in whole or in part, for tax reporting purposes as a
result of the limitations under Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations
issued thereunder.

  

  

5.12.8 All deferred compensation plans, programs or arrangements for payment
of "nonqualified deferred compensation" (as defined in Code Section
409A(d)(1)) have been in documentary compliance and have been operated in all
respects in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder.

  

  

5.13. Environmental Matters.

  

  

5.13.1. To the Knowledge of MainSource, neither the conduct nor operation of
their business nor any condition of any property currently or previously owned
or operated by any of them (including Participation Facilities and Other Real
Estate Owned), or on which any of them holds a lien, results or resulted in a
violation of any Environmental Laws that is reasonably likely to impose a
material liability (including a material remediation obligation) upon
MainSource or any MainSource Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of MainSource, no
condition has existed or event has occurred with respect to such property
that, with notice or the passage of time, or both, is reasonably likely to
result in any material liability to MainSource or any MainSource Subsidiary by
reason of any Environmental Laws. During the past five (5) years, neither
MainSource nor any MainSource Subsidiary has received any written notice from
any Person or Governmental Entity that MainSource or any MainSource Subsidiary
or the operation or condition of any property ever owned or operated
(including Participation Facilities) by any of them are currently in violation
of or otherwise are alleged to have liability under any Environmental Laws or
relating to Materials of Environmental Concern (including, but not limited to,
responsibility (or potential responsibility) for the cleanup or other
remediation of any Materials of Environmental Concern at, on, beneath, or
originating from any such property) for which a material liability is
reasonably likely to be imposed upon MainSource or any MainSource Subsidiary.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

5.13.2. There is no suit, written claim, action, demand, executive or
administrative order, directive or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of
MainSource, threatened, before any court, governmental agency or other forum
against MainSource or any MainSource Subsidiary (x) for alleged noncompliance
(including by any predecessor) with, or liability under, any Environmental Law
or (y) relating to the presence of or release into the environment of any
Materials of Environmental Concern (as defined herein), on a site owned,
leased or operated by MainSource or any MainSource Subsidiary (including
Participation Facilities and Other Real Estate Owned).

  

  

5.14. Loan Portfolio.

  

  

The reserves, and the allowance for loan and lease losses and the carrying
value for real estate owned reflected in the MainSource Financial Statements
as of September 30, 2015 was, and that reflected in the MainSource Financial
Statements for periods ending after September 30, 2015 were or will be,
adequate, as of the dates thereof, under GAAP in all material respects.

  

  

5.15. Antitakeover Provisions Inapplicable.

  

  

The transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not subject to the
requirements of any "moratorium," "control share," "fair price," "affiliate
transactions," "business combination" or other antitakeover laws and
regulations of the State of Indiana, including the provisions of the IBCL
applicable to MainSource.

  

  

5.16. Risk Management Arrangements.

  

  

All material interest rate swaps, caps, floors, option agreements, futures and

entered into for MainSource's own account, or for the account of one or more
of MainSource's Subsidiaries or their customers, were in all material respects
entered into in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and
regulatory policies, and to the Knowledge of MainSource and each MainSource
Subsidiary, with counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the
time; and to the Knowledge of MainSource and the applicable MainSource
Subsidiary, each of them constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation
of MainSource or such MainSource Subsidiary, enforceable in accordance with
its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights or by
general equity principles), and is in full force and effect. Neither
MainSource nor any MainSource Subsidiary, nor to the Knowledge of MainSource
any other party thereto, is in breach of any of its obligations under any such
agreement or arrangement in any material respect.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

5.17. Brokers, Finders and Financial Advisors.

officers, directors, employees or agents, has employed any broker, finder,
financial advisor, or other person acting on behalf of MainSource under any
authority of MainSource in connection with the transactions contemplated by

fees, commissions, or any other form of compensation or payment to any such
person in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except for the retention of Boenning and Scattergood, Inc. by MainSource and the
fee payable pursuant thereto.

with the terms of the governing documents and applicable laws and regulations.
Neither MainSource nor any MainSource Subsidiary, nor, to the Knowledge of

committed any breach of trust with respect to any such fiduciary account or
the records for each such fiduciary account.

  

  

5.21. Ownership of Cheviot Financial Shares.

reasonably request. Cheviot Financial will promptly notify MainSource of any
material change in the normal course of its business or in the operation of
its properties and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, of any
governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the institution or the
threat of material litigation involving Cheviot Financial or any Cheviot
Financial Subsidiary. Any information provided pursuant to this Section 6.2.1
will be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and may only be used to
facilitate the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

6.2.2. Cheviot Financial and MainSource Bank shall meet on a regular basis to
discuss and plan for the conversion of Cheviot Financial's data processing and
related electronic informational systems to those used by MainSource Bank,
which planning shall include, but not be limited to: discussion of the
possible termination by Cheviot Financial of third-party service provider
arrangements effective at the Effective Time or at a date thereafter; non-
renewal of personal property leases and software licenses used by

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

Cheviot Financial in connection with its systems operations; retention of
outside consultants and additional employees to assist with the conversion and
outsourcing, as appropriate, of proprietary or self-provided system services,
it being understood that Cheviot Financial shall not be obligated to take any
such action prior to the Effective Time and, unless Cheviot Financial
otherwise agrees, no conversion shall take place prior to the Effective Time.
In the event that Cheviot Financial takes, at the request of MainSource Bank,
any action relative to third parties to facilitate the conversion that results
in the imposition of any fees, expenses or charges, MainSource Bank shall pay
any such fees, expenses and charges directly to such third parties, and shall
indemnify Cheviot Financial for the costs of taking any action to facilitate
the conversion process.

  

  

6.2.3. Cheviot Financial shall provide MainSource, substantially
contemporaneously with the delivery to the Board of Directors of Cheviot
Financial of the materials for the monthly board meeting (other than materials
which Cheviot Financial is not required to make available to MainSource
pursuant to Section 6.3.1 of this Agreement), a written list of nonperforming
assets as of the prior month end (the term "nonperforming assets," for
purposes of this subsection, means (i) loans that are "troubled debt
restructuring" as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting
Standards Codification 310-40, "Troubled Debt Restructuring by Creditors," as
updated by Accounting Standards Update 2011-02", (ii) loans on nonaccrual,
(iii) OREO, (iv) all loans ninety (90) days or more past due as of the end of
such month and (iv) impaired loans). On a monthly basis, Cheviot Financial
shall provide MainSource with a copy if its month-end loan trial balance and a
schedule of all chargeoffs or activity in its loan loss reserves.

  

  

6.2.4. Cheviot Financial shall promptly inform MainSource, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, upon receiving notice of any legal,
administrative, arbitration or other proceedings, demands, notices, audits or
investigations (by any federal, state or local commission, agency or board)
relating to the alleged liability of Cheviot Financial or any Cheviot
Financial Subsidiary under any labor or employment law.

  

  

6.3. Access to Properties and Records.

  

  

6.3.1. Subject to Section 12.1 hereof, Cheviot Financial shall permit
MainSource reasonable access upon reasonable notice to its properties and
those of the Cheviot Financial Subsidiaries, and shall disclose and make
available to MainSource during normal business hours all of its books, papers
and records relating to the assets, properties, operations, obligations and
liabilities, including, but not limited to, all books of account (including
the general ledger), tax records, minute books of directors' (other than
minutes that discuss any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any other subject matter Cheviot Financial reasonably determines should be
treated as confidential) and stockholders' meetings, organizational documents,
Bylaws, material contracts and agreements, filings with any regulatory
authority, litigation files, plans affecting employees, and any other business
activities or prospects in which MainSource may have a reasonable interest;
provided, however, that Cheviot Financial shall not be required to take any
action that would provide access to or to disclose information where such
access or disclosure, in Cheviot Financial's reasonable judgment, would
interfere with the normal conduct of Cheviot Financial's business or would
violate or prejudice the rights or business

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

interests or confidences of any customer or other person or would result in
the waiver by it of the privilege protecting communications between it and any
of its counsel or with regard to which disclosure to MainSource is prohibited
by law or regulation. Cheviot Financial shall provide and shall request its
auditors to provide MainSource with such historical financial information
regarding it (and related audit reports and consents) as MainSource may
reasonably request for Securities Law disclosure purposes. MainSource shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with Cheviot
Financial's regular business operations during any such access to Cheviot
Financial's property, books and records.

  

  

6.3.2. Cheviot Financial shall permit MainSource, at MainSource's expense, to
cause a "Phase I Environmental Site Assessment" (the "Phase I") (in
conformance with American Society for Testing Materials ("ASTM") Standard
1527-13, as amended) to be performed at each branch office and other
properties owned by Cheviot Financial, and, to the extent permitted by any
lease governing Cheviot Financial's lease of any branch, at each branch leased
by Cheviot Financial, at any time prior to the Closing Date. To the extent
such Phase I identifies a "Recognized Environmental Condition" (as such term
is defined by the ASTM) then MainSource may perform, if MainSource determines
to do so, a phase II or similar invasive, investigative study. If a Phase II
is to be performed at a branch which Cheviot Financial leases and the landlord
pursuant to the applicable lease has not consented to such Phase II, Cheviot
Financial will use its commercially reasonable efforts (at no cost to Cheviot
Financial) to obtain such landlord consent. If a Phase II is to be performed
at a branch which Cheviot Financial leases and the landlord pursuant to the
applicable lease has consented to a Phase II then Cheviot Financial will use
its commercially reasonable efforts (at no cost to Cheviot Financial) to
provide notice to the landlord if required under the lease. Prior to
performing any Phase II, MainSource will provide Cheviot Financial with a copy
of its proposed work plan and MainSource will cooperate in good faith with
Cheviot Financial to address any comments or suggestions made by Cheviot
Financial regarding the work plan. MainSource and its environmental consultant
shall conduct all environmental assessments pursuant to this Section 6.3.2 at
mutually agreeable times and so as to eliminate or minimize to the greatest
extent possible interference with Cheviot Financial's operation of its
business, and MainSource shall maintain or cause to be maintained reasonably
adequate insurance with respect to any assessment conducted hereunder.
MainSource shall be required to restore each property to substantially its
pre-assessment condition. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with
any Phase I or Phase II and any restoration and clean up, shall be borne
solely by MainSource.

  

  

6.3.3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.3,
in no event shall MainSource have access to any information that, based on
advice of Cheviot Financial's counsel, would (a) reasonably be expected to
waive any material legal privilege, (b) result in the disclosure of any trade
secrets of third parties or (c) violate any obligation of Cheviot Financial
with respect to confidentiality so long as, with respect to confidentiality,
to the extent specifically requested by MainSource, Cheviot Financial has made
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver regarding the possible
disclosure from the third party to whom it owes an obligation of
confidentiality. Further, MainSource shall not have access to information that
relates to the Merger or an Acquisition Proposal. All requests made pursuant
to this Section 6.3 shall be directed to an executive officer of Cheviot
Financial or such Person or Persons as may be designated by Cheviot Financial.
All information received pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall be governed by the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

6.4. Financial and Other Statements.

  

  

6.4.1. Promptly upon receipt thereof, Cheviot Financial will furnish to
MainSource copies of each annual, interim or special internal or external
audit of the books of Cheviot Financial and each Cheviot Financial Subsidiary
made by Cheviot Financial, its independent auditors or other auditors, and
copies of all internal control reports submitted to Cheviot Financial by
auditors in connection with each annual, interim or special internal or
external audit of the books of Cheviot Financial and the Cheviot Financial
Subsidiaries made by its auditors.

  

  

6.4.2. Cheviot Financial will furnish to MainSource copies of all documents,
statements and reports as it or any Cheviot Financial Subsidiary shall send to
its stockholders, the SEC, the FDIC, the Ohio Division, or any other
Governmental Entity or Bank Regulator, except as legally prohibited thereby.

  

  

6.4.3. Cheviot Financial will advise MainSource promptly of the receipt of any
examination report of any Bank Regulator with respect to the condition or
activities of Cheviot Financial or any Cheviot Financial Subsidiary.

  

  

6.4.4. With reasonable promptness, Cheviot Financial will furnish to
MainSource such additional financial data that Cheviot Financial possesses and
as MainSource may reasonably request, including without limitation, detailed
monthly financial statements and loan reports.

  

  

6.5. Maintenance of Insurance.

  

  

Cheviot Financial shall maintain, and cause the Cheviot Financial Subsidiaries
to maintain, insurance in such amounts as are reasonable to cover such risks
as are customary in relation to the character and location of its properties
and the nature of its business.

  

  

6.6. Disclosure Supplements.

  

  

From time to time prior to the Effective Time, Cheviot Financial will promptly
supplement or amend the Cheviot Financial Disclosure Schedule in connection
herewith with respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing,
occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
be set forth or described in such Cheviot Financial Disclosure Schedule or
which is necessary to correct any information in such Cheviot Financial
Disclosure Schedule that has been rendered materially inaccurate thereby. No
supplement or amendment to such Cheviot Financial Disclosure Schedule shall
have any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in Article IX.

  

  

6.7. Consents and Approvals of Third Parties; Proxy Solicitor.

  

  

Cheviot Financial shall use all commercially reasonable efforts, and shall
cause each Cheviot Financial Subsidiary to use all commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain as soon as practicable all consents and approvals of any
other persons necessary or desirable for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Cheviot Financial may utilize the services of a professional proxy
soliciting firm to provide assistance in obtaining the stockholder vote
required to be obtained by it hereunder.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

6.8. All Reasonable Efforts.

  

  

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, Cheviot Financial agrees
to use, and agrees to cause each Cheviot Financial Subsidiary to use, all
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

6.9. Failure to Fulfill Conditions.

  

  

In the event that Cheviot Financial determines that a condition to its
obligation to complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled, it will promptly notify
MainSource.

  

  

6.10. No Solicitation.

  

  

6.10.1. Cheviot Financial shall not, and shall cause the Cheviot Financial
Subsidiaries and the respective officers, directors, employees, investment
bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, consultants, affiliates
and other agents (collectively, the "Cheviot Financial Representatives") not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly
encourage, or take any action to facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer
or proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead

  

to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise
afford access, to any Person (other than MainSource) any information or data
with respect to Cheviot Financial or any of the Cheviot Financial Subsidiaries
or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) release any Person
from, waive any provisions of, or fail to enforce any confidentiality
agreement or standstill agreement to which Cheviot Financial is a party; or
(iv) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any
Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of
intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by Cheviot Financial or any Cheviot Financial Representative,
whether or not such Representative is so authorized and whether or not such
Cheviot Financial Representative is purporting to act on behalf of Cheviot
Financial or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by
Cheviot Financial. Cheviot Financial and Cheviot Financial Subsidiaries shall,
and shall cause each of the Cheviot Financial Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions,
negotiations, and communications with any Persons with respect to any existing
or potential Acquisition Proposal.

  

  

For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any inquiry,
offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from MainSource),
made by a third party, whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to,
or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (A) any
transaction or series of transactions, including by way of merger,
consolidation, recapitalization, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

or similar transaction, involving Cheviot Financial or any of the Cheviot
Financial Subsidiaries and representing, in the aggregate, twenty-five percent
(25%) or more of the assets of Cheviot Financial and the Cheviot Financial
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (B) any transaction pursuant to which
any third party or group acquires or would acquire (whether through sale,
lease or other disposition), directly or indirectly, any assets of Cheviot
Financial or any of the Cheviot Financial Subsidiaries representing, in the
aggregate, twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the assets of Cheviot
Financial and the Cheviot Financial Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (C)
any issuance, sale or other disposition of (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange or any similar transaction) securities (or
options, rights or warrants to purchase or securities convertible into, such
securities) representing twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the total voting
power of Cheviot Financial or any of the Cheviot Financial Subsidiaries in the
election of directors; (D) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in any third party or group beneficially owning
twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the total voting power of Cheviot
Financial or any of the Cheviot Financial Subsidiaries in the election of
directors; or (E) any transaction which is similar in form, substance or
purpose to any of the foregoing transactions, or any combination of the
foregoing.

  

  

6.10.2. Notwithstanding Section 6.10.1, Cheviot Financial may take any of the
actions described in clause (ii) of Section 6.10.1 only if, (i) Cheviot
Financial has received a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal
prior to the Cheviot Financial Stockholders Meeting that did not result from a
breach of this Section 6.10; (ii) the Cheviot Financial Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with and having considered the
advice of its outside legal counsel and its independent financial advisor,
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to
a Superior Proposal; (iii) Cheviot Financial has provided MainSource with at
least one (1) Business Day's prior notice of such determination; and (iv)
prior to furnishing or affording access to any information or data with
respect to Cheviot Financial or any of the Cheviot Financial Subsidiaries or
otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, Cheviot Financial receives from
such Person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to
Cheviot Financial than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.
Cheviot Financial shall promptly (within one (1) hour) provide to MainSource
any non-public information regarding Cheviot Financial or the Cheviot
Financial Subsidiaries provided to any other Person that was not previously
provided to MainSource.

  

  

For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide
written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended
or modified) made by a third party to enter into an Acquisition Transaction on
terms that the Cheviot Financial Board of Directors determines in its good
faith judgment, after consultation with and having considered the advice of
outside legal counsel and a financial advisor (i) would, if consummated,
result in the acquisition of at least fifty percent (50%) of the issued and
outstanding shares of Cheviot Financial Common Stock or all, or substantially
all, of the assets of Cheviot Financial and the Cheviot Financial Subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis; (ii) would result in a transaction that (A) involves
consideration to the holders of the shares of Cheviot Financial Common Stock
that is more favorable, from a financial point of view, than the consideration
to be paid to the Cheviot Financial stockholders pursuant to this Agreement,
considering, among other things, the nature of the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

  

of the consideration being offered, the percentage of the outstanding Cheviot
Financial Common Stock proposed to be acquired, and any material regulatory
approvals or other risks associated with the timing of the proposed
transaction beyond or in addition to those specifically contemplated hereby,
and which proposal is not conditioned upon obtaining additional financing and
(B) is, in light of the other terms of such proposal, more favorable to the
Cheviot Financial stockholders than the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) is reasonably likely to be completed
on the terms proposed, in each case taking into account all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal; provided that, for the purposes
of the definition of Superior Proposal, the references to twenty-five percent
(25%) in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be fifty percent (50%).

  

  

6.10.3. Cheviot Financial shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours) notify MainSource in writing if any proposals or offers are
received by, any information is requested from, or any negotiations or
discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, Cheviot Financial or
any Cheviot Financial Representatives, in each case in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall indicate the name of the Person
initiating such discussions or negotiations or making such proposal, offer or
information request and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or
offers (and, in the case of written materials relating to such proposal,
offer, information request, negotiations or discussion, providing copies of
such materials (including e-mails or other electronic communications). Cheviot
Financial agrees that it shall keep MainSource informed, on a current basis,
of the status and terms of any such proposal, offer, information request,
negotiations or discussions (including any amendments or modifications to such
proposal, offer or request).

  

  

6.10.4. Subject to Section 6.10.5, neither the Cheviot Financial Board of
Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or
propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to MainSource in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger), the Cheviot Financial Recommendation (as defined in Section 8.1.1),
or make any statement, filing or release, in connection with the Cheviot
Financial Stockholders Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the Cheviot
Financial Recommendation (it being understood that taking a neutral position
or no position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an
adverse modification of the Cheviot Financial Recommendation); (ii) approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal; or (iii) enter into (or cause Cheviot Financial or any of the
Cheviot Financial Subsidiaries to enter into) any letter of intent, agreement
in principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement (A) related to any
Acquisition Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into
in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.10.2) or (B) requiring Cheviot
Financial to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

6.10.5. Notwithstanding Section 6.10.4, at any time prior to the approval of
the Merger at the Cheviot Financial Stockholders Meeting, the Cheviot
Financial Board of Directors may approve or recommend to the stockholders of
Cheviot Financial a Superior Proposal and withdraw, qualify or modify the
Cheviot Financial Recommendation in connection therewith (an "Cheviot
Financial Subsequent Determination") after the fifth (5th) Business Day
following MainSource's receipt of a notice (the "Notice of Superior Proposal")
from Cheviot Financial advising MainSource that the Cheviot Financial Board of
Directors has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal that it received (that did not result from a breach of this Section
6.10) constitutes a Superior

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

Proposal (it being understood that Cheviot Financial shall be required to
deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal in respect of any revised Superior
Proposal from such third party or its affiliates that Cheviot Financial
proposes to accept and the subsequent notice period shall be five (5) business
days) if, but only if, (i) the Cheviot Financial Board of Directors has
reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with and having
considered the advice of outside legal counsel and a financial advisor, that
the failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to violate its
fiduciary duties to Cheviot Financial's stockholders under applicable law, and
(ii) at the end of such five (5) Business Day period, after taking into
account any such adjusted, modified or amended terms as may have been
committed to in writing by MainSource since its receipt of such Notice of
Superior Proposal (provided, however, that MainSource shall not have any
obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement), the Cheviot Financial Board of
Directors has again in good faith made the determination (A) in clause (i) of
this Section 6.10.5, and (B) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the changing, qualifying or
modifying of the Cheviot Financial Recommendation or the making of a Cheviot
Financial Subsequent Determination by the Cheviot Financial Board of Directors
shall not change the approval of the Cheviot Financial Board of Directors for
purposes of causing any applicable "moratorium," "control share," "fair
price," "takeover," "interested stockholder" or similar law to be inapplicable
to this Agreement and the Cheviot Financial Voting Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger.

  

  

6.11. Board of Directors and Committee Meetings.

  

  

Beginning on the date of this Agreement, Cheviot Financial shall permit
representatives of MainSource or MainSource Bank (no more than two) to receive
notice of and to attend any meeting of its Board of Directors and all
committees of Cheviot Financial and each Cheviot Financial Subsidiary,
including, without limitation, the Executive and Loan Committees, as an
observer, subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, provided that Cheviot
Financial shall not be required to permit the representative to remain present
during any confidential discussion of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby or any third party proposal to acquire control of Cheviot
Financial or during any other matter (i) that the respective Board of
Directors has reasonably determined to be confidential with respect to the
participation of MainSource or MainSource Bank, or (ii) that Cheviot Financial
would not be required to disclose under Section 6.3.3 hereof.

  

  

6.12. Employee Benefits.

  

  

Neither the terms of Section 7.6 hereof nor the provision of any employee
benefits by MainSource or any of its Subsidiaries to employees of Cheviot
Financial or any of its Subsidiaries shall, except as specifically set forth
therein: (a) create any employment contract, agreement or understanding with
or employment rights for, or constitute a commitment or obligation of
employment to, any of the officers or employees of Cheviot Financial or any of
its Subsidiaries; or (b) prohibit or restrict MainSource or its Subsidiaries,
whether before or after the Effective Time, from changing, amending or
terminating any employee benefits provided to its employees from time to time.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

  

6.13. Cheviot Financial 401(k) Plan.

  

  

No later than the day prior to the Effective Time, and subject to the
occurrence of the Effective Time, Cheviot Financial shall cause to be adopted
prior to the Effective Time resolutions of the Board of Directors of Cheviot
Financial and any necessary amendments to terminate the Cheviot Financial
401(k) Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time and cease all
contributions to the Cheviot Financial 401(k) Plan maintained or sponsored by
Cheviot Financial or Cheviot Savings Bank, and to prohibit the entry of new
participants to the Cheviot Financial 401(k) Plan as of the day preceding the
Closing Date. The form and substance of such resolutions and any necessary
amendments shall be subject to the review and approval of MainSource, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld. Cheviot Financial shall deliver to
MainSource an executed copy of such resolutions and any necessary amendments
as soon as practicable following their adoption by the Board of Directors of
Cheviot Financial and shall fully comply with such resolutions and any
necessary amendments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and in all events,
MainSource will allow Continuing Employees to rollover their Cheviot Financial
401(k) Plan account balances (including any plan loans) to the MainSource KSOP
and, if necessary, MainSource will make any amendments to the MainSource KSOP
Plan to effectuate such rollovers.

  

  

6.14. Cheviot Financial ESOP.

  

  

Cheviot Financial and Cheviot Savings Bank shall, effective no later than
immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective Time (the "ESOP
Termination Date"), adopt such necessary resolutions and or amendments to the
Cheviot Financial ESOP, the Cheviot Financial ESOP trust, the ESOP Term Loan
Agreement by and between the Cheviot Financial Corp. Employee Stock Ownership
Plan Trust and Cheviot Financial Corp. dated as of January 18, 2012, the ESOP
Term Note dated as of January 18, 2012 and the Pledge and Security Agreement
dated as of January 18, 2012 (collectively, the "ESOP Loan"), to (i) direct
the Cheviot Financial ESOP trustee to deliver a sufficient number of
unallocated shares of Cheviot Financial Common Stock held in the Cheviot
Financial's ESOP's Suspense Account (as defined in the Cheviot Financial ESOP)
to Cheviot Financial to repay any outstanding ESOP Loan at the Effective Time,
(ii) provide for treatment of all remaining shares of Cheviot Financial Common
Stock held in the Cheviot Financial ESOP trust in accordance with Section 3.1
of this Agreement, and (iii) provide that no new participants shall be
admitted to the Cheviot Financial ESOP on or after the ESOP Termination Date.
The form and substance of such resolutions and any necessary amendments shall
be subject to the review and approval of MainSource, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Cheviot Financial shall deliver to MainSource an
executed copy of such resolutions and any necessary amendments as soon as
practicable following their adoption by the Board of Directors of Cheviot
Financial and shall fully comply with such resolutions and any necessary
amendments. The accounts of all participants and beneficiaries in the ESOP as
of the ESOP Termination Date shall become fully vested as of the ESOP
Termination Date. Any unallocated shares of Cheviot Financial Common Stock
held in the Cheviot Financial ESOP's Suspense Account after repayment of the
ESOP Loan shall be converted into Merger Consideration and shall be allocated
as earnings to the accounts of Cheviot Financial ESOP participants who are
employed as of the ESOP Termination Date based on their account balances under
the Cheviot Financial ESOP as of the ESOP Termination Date. As soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, Cheviot Financial shall file or
cause to be filed all necessary documents with the IRS for a determination
letter for termination of the Cheviot Financial ESOP. As soon as practicable
following the receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS
regarding the qualified status of the Cheviot Financial ESOP upon its
termination, the account balances in the Cheviot Financial ESOP shall either
be distributed to participants and beneficiaries or transferred to an eligible
tax-qualified retirement plan or individual retirement account as a
participant or beneficiary may direct. MainSource agrees to permit Cheviot
Financial ESOP participants who become employees of MainSource or MainSource
Subsidiaries to roll over their account balances in the Cheviot Financial ESOP
to the MainSource KSOP.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

  

6.15. Disposition Welfare Benefit and Code Section 125 Plans.

  

  

All welfare benefit (health, dental/vision, life/accidental death and
dismemberment and long term disability), and Code Section 125, or "cafeteria,"
plans currently sponsored by Cheviot Financial shall continue as separate
plans after the Effective Time, until such time as MainSource determines, in
its sole discretion, that it will terminate any or all of such plans.

  

  

As of the Effective Time Cheviot Financial shall take, or cause to be taken,
all actions necessary to assign any and all applicable group insurance
policies to MainSource and to provide MainSource all necessary financial,
enrollment, eligibility, contractual and other information related to its
welfare benefit and cafeteria plans to assist MainSource in the administration
of such plans.

  

  

From the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, Cheviot Financial
shall continue to: (i) pay the applicable insurance premiums necessary to
continue the benefits under Cheviot Financial's fully insured welfare benefit
plans; (iii) accrue, as an expense, in accordance with past practice, monthly
amounts to be used to satisfy claims under any self-insured welfare benefit
plan and (iii) contribute to the cafeteria plan the pre-tax amounts which the
cafeteria plan participants elect to defer from their compensation.

  

  

As of the date of any future termination of the Cheviot Financial cafeteria
plan, the balances in any health and dependent care flexible spending accounts
thereunder shall be transferred to the MainSource cafeteria plan, and the
benefit and compensation deferral elections in effect at that time shall be
continued under the MainSource cafeteria plan, subject to subsequent changes
as provided in the MainSource plan. All benefit payments related to the
transferred balances shall be made in accordance with the MainSource cafeteria
plan.

Cheviot Financial or any Subsidiary, as applicable, shall terminate each
nonqualified deferred compensation arrangement set forth on Cheviot Financial
Disclosure Schedule 6.16 in accordance with Treasury Regulation
§1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B) effective on the day immediately prior to the Effective
Time. The manner of calculation of such payments is set forth on Cheviot
Financial Disclosure Schedule 6.16, The form and substance of any resolutions
and any necessary amendments shall be subject to the review and approval of
MainSource, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Cheviot Financial shall

Cheviot Financial or any Subsidiary shall continue all incentive and/or bonus
plans through the Closing Date. A prorated portion of incentive or bonus
compensation based on performance of prorated achievement of performance
metrics under those plans as of the Closing Date shall be paid in a lump sum
no later than the day immediately prior to the Closing Date, unless
historically the incentive or bonus compensation has been paid sooner, in
which case it will be paid at the same time as historical practice. Effective
on the day immediately prior to the Effective Time, employees of Cheviot
Financial or any Subsidiary who are covered by an incentive and/or bonus plan
will continue to be covered by either a Cheviot Financial or Subsidiary
incentive or bonus plan, or a MainSource or MainSource subsidiary incentive or
bonus plan, as determined by MainSource in its sole discretion. To the extent
MainSource determines not to cover any Cheviot Financial or Subsidiary
employee under a Cheviot Financial or Subsidiary incentive or bonus plan, that
plan will be terminated effective as of the later of the date of such
determination or the day immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Agreement (including without limitation any termination of employment relating
thereto and occurring prior to, at or following the Effective Time), Cheviot
Financial, its ERISA Affiliates and their respective successors will not be
obligated to make a payment that would be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" to an individual who is a "disqualified individual," as
such terms are defined in Code Section 280G.

Option into cash as provided in Section 3.5.1. Cheviot Financial shall take
action prior to the Effective Time to cause the freezing and/or termination of

listed on MainSource Disclosure Schedule 6.20 to include a commercially
reasonable non-solicitation clause. Cheviot Financial shall also amend the

provide that in no event may an "excess parachute payment" under Code Section
280G be paid under such agreements.

  

  

6.21. Rule 16b-3.

  

  

Cheviot Financial shall take all steps, as may be necessary or appropriate, to
cause the transactions contemplated by Article III and any other dispositions

under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

ARTICLE VII

  

  

COVENANTS OF MAINSOURCE

  

  

7.1. Conduct of Business.

  

  

During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
except with the written consent of Cheviot Financial, which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, MainSource will, and it will
cause each MainSource Subsidiary to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
preserve intact its business organization and assets and maintain its rights
and franchises; and voluntarily take no action that would: (i) adversely
affect the ability of the parties to obtain the Regulatory Approvals or
materially increase the period of time necessary to obtain such approvals;
(ii) materially adversely affect its ability to perform its covenants and
agreements under this Agreement; or (iii) result in the representations and
warranties contained in Article V of this Agreement not being true and correct
on the date of this Agreement or at any future date on or prior to the Closing
Date or in any of the conditions set forth in Article IX hereof not being
satisfied; provided, however that the forgoing shall not be deemed to require
MainSource to take any action which would otherwise violate any other
provision of this Agreement

  

  

7.2. Disclosure Supplements.

  

  

From time to time prior to the Effective Time, MainSource will promptly
supplement or amend the MainSource Disclosure Schedule delivered in connection
herewith with respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing,
occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
be set forth or described in such MainSource Disclosure Schedule or which is
necessary to correct any information in such MainSource Disclosure Schedule
that has been rendered materially inaccurate thereby. No supplement or
amendment to such MainSource Disclosure Schedule shall have any effect for the
purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX.

  

  

7.3. Consents and Approvals of Third Parties.

  

  

MainSource shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as soon as
practicable all consents and approvals of any other Persons necessary or
desirable for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

  

7.4. All Reasonable Efforts.

  

  

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, MainSource agrees to use
all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. MainSource shall not, and shall
not permit any MainSource Subsidiary to, take any action or knowingly fail to
take any reasonable action that would, or would be reasonably likely to,
prevent, impede, or delay the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

72  

  

 

 

 

  

7.5. Failure to Fulfill Conditions.

  

  

In the event that MainSource determines that a condition to its obligation to
complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled, it will promptly notify Cheviot
Financial.

  

  

7.6. Employee Benefits; Advisory Board.

  

  

7.6.1 Except as forth in Cheviot Financial Disclosure Schedule 7.6.1 or as
otherwise provided in Sections 6.13 through 6.17 or this Section 7.6.1 of this
Agreement, as of or after the Effective Time, and at MainSource's election and
subject to the requirements of the Code, the Cheviot Financial Compensation
and Benefit Plans may continue to be maintained separately, consolidated,
frozen or terminated. If reasonably requested by MainSource in writing not
later than ten (10) days before the Closing Date and provided that MainSource
has indicated in writing that the conditions to its obligations set forth in
Section 9.2 hereof have been satisfied or waived, Cheviot Financial shall take
such steps within its power to effectuate a freeze or termination of any
Cheviot Financial Compensation and Benefit Plan as of the day immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and contingent upon the Effective Time, provided
that the Cheviot Financial Compensation and Benefit Plan can be frozen or
terminated within such period under the terms of such plan and any applicable
laws and regulations. In the event of a consolidation of any or all of such
plans or in the event of termination of any Cheviot Financial Compensation and
Benefit Plan, except as otherwise set forth in this Section 7.6.1, employees
of Cheviot Financial or Cheviot Savings Bank who continue as employees of
MainSource or MainSource Bank after the Effective Time ("Continuing
Employees") shall be eligible to participate in any MainSource Bank employee
plan of similar character immediately upon such consolidation or as of the
first entry date coincident with or immediately following such termination.
Continuing Employees shall receive credit for service with Cheviot Financial
or Cheviot Savings Bank (including service with any company acquired by
Cheviot Financial or Cheviot Savings Bank) for purposes of determining
eligibility and vesting but not for purposes of accruing or computing benefits
under any similar existing MainSource benefit plan. MainSource shall provide
Continuing Employees with compensation, employee benefits and terms and
conditions of employment that are substantially similar to those provided by
MainSource to similarly situated employees of MainSource. After the Effective
Time, Cheviot Financial's PTO policy shall terminate and all Continuing
Employees shall be subject to MainSource's PTO policy. MainSource will not
credit Continuing Employees with any accrued but unused vacation or sick time
under the Cheviot Financial PTO policy as of the Effective Time. Cheviot
Financial will be responsible for paying out any accrued but unused PTO and
vacation time as of the day prior to the Effective Time. Continuing Employees
will begin accruing paid time off under MainSource's PTO policy as of the
Effective Time. This Agreement shall not be construed to limit the ability of
MainSource or MainSource Bank to terminate the employment of any Cheviot
Financial employee or the employee of any Cheviot Financial Subsidiary or to
review any Cheviot Financial Compensation and Benefit Plan from time to time
and to make such changes (including terminating any such plan) as they deem
appropriate.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

73  

  

 

 

 

  

7.6.2 MainSource shall honor the contractual terms of all employment,
consulting, change in control, severance and other agreements and plans listed
on Cheviot Financial Disclosure Schedule 4.13.8, except to the extent, with
the written consent of the affected parties, any such agreement or plan is
amended, revised, superseded, renewed or terminated as of, or following, the
Effective Time of the Bank Merger. Cheviot Financial shall, prior to the
Effective Time, use its reasonable efforts to obtain from each of the
individuals named in Cheviot Financial Disclosure Schedule 7.6.2 a settlement
agreement, with the terms set forth on Cheviot Financial Disclosure Schedule
7.6.2, setting forth the method in which his or her rights under the specified
programs will be settled (the amount of each such payment to be limited to the
amounts specified in Cheviot Financial Disclosure Schedule 7.6.2) in the event
such individuals are entitled to payment or benefits (each a "Settlement
Agreement"). MainSource shall make the payments required under the employment,
change in control, Settlement Agreement, or similar agreements.

  


 

  

7.6.3 Except for the individuals covered by employment or change in control
agreements, those employees of Cheviot Financial or its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time whom MainSource or its subsidiaries elect not to employ after
the Effective Time or employ but then terminate within six months after the
Effective Time or voluntarily resigns employment due to an involuntary
relocation of an individual's principal place of employment to a location
which is more than twenty-five (25) miles from the employee's principal place
of employment immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Separated Employees")
shall be entitled to severance benefits equal to two weeks of pay for each
year of service, subject to a minimum package equal to four weeks of pay and a
maximum package equal to 26 weeks of pay. After six months after the Effective
Time, all Continuing Employees (except for individuals who are then party to
an employment agreement, change in control agreement, severance or similar
agreement as described in Section 7.6.2) shall be entitled to severance
benefits equal to those provided by MainSource from time to time to its
employees ("MainSource Severance Plan"). For purposes of determining each
Continuing Employee's length of service, each Continuing Employee shall
receive credit for years of service with Cheviot Financial or its
subsidiaries, or their predecessors. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed
to limit or modify MainSource's at-will employment policy.

  

  

7.6.4 In the event of any termination of any Cheviot Financial health plan or
consolidation of any such plan with any MainSource or MainSource Bank health
plan, MainSource shall make available to Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents employer-provided health coverage on the same basis as it
provides such coverage to MainSource employees. Unless a Continuing Employee
affirmatively terminates coverage under a Cheviot Financial health plan prior
to the time that such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate in
the MainSource health plan, no coverage of any of the Continuing Employees or
their dependents shall terminate under any of the Cheviot Financial health
plans prior to the time such Continuing Employees and their dependents become
eligible to participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to
all employees of MainSource and their dependents.

  

  

Until the Effective Time, Cheviot Financial or a Cheviot Financial Subsidiary,
whichever is applicable, shall be liable for all obligations for continued
health coverage pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601 through
609 of ERISA for eligible employees who incur a qualifying event before the
Effective Time. MainSource or a MainSource Subsidiary, whichever is
applicable, shall after the Effective Time be liable for (i) all obligations
for continued health coverage under COBRA with respect to each qualified
beneficiary of Cheviot Financial or a Cheviot Financial Subsidiary who incurs
a termination on and after the Effective Time, and (ii) for continued health
coverage under COBRA from and after the Effective Time for each qualified
beneficiary of Cheviot Financial or Cheviot Financial Subsidiary who incurs a
qualifying event before the Effective Time.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

74  

  

 

 

 

  

7.6.5 MainSource agrees to take all such actions related to the Cheviot
Financial 401(k) Plan as stated in Section 6.12 and related to the Cheviot
Financial ESOP as stated in Section 6.13 of this Agreement. As of the
Effective Time, subject to applicable law and the requirements of the
MainSource KSOP, MainSource shall amend as necessary the MainSource KSOP so
that, (i) from and after the Effective Time, Continuing Employees will accrue
benefits pursuant to the MainSource KSOP, and (ii) Continuing Employees
participating in the MainSource KSOP shall receive credit for eligibility and
vesting purposes, for the service of such employees with Cheviot Financial and
its Subsidiaries or their predecessors prior to the Effective Time, as if such
service were with MainSource or its Subsidiaries.

  

  

7.6.6 MainSource shall (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees and their family members
under the health and welfare plans of MainSource and its Affiliates (each a
"MainSource Welfare Plan") to the extent waived or otherwise satisfied under
the applicable corresponding Cheviot Financial Compensation and Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) to the extent that the initial
period of coverage for Continuing Employees under any such MainSource employee
benefit plans is not a full 12-month period of coverage, Continuing Employees
shall be given credit under the applicable plan for any deductibles and co-
insurance payments made by such Continuing Employees and their dependents
under the corresponding Cheviot Financial plan during the balance of such
12-month period of coverage provided that MainSource can obtain, in a manner
satisfactory to MainSource, as determined in its sole discretion, the
necessary data and provided that the insurer agrees. In the event the insurer
does not agree, MainSource shall take all action necessary to ensure that
Continuing Employees and their dependents do not lose the value of the
deductibles and co-insurance payments whether that be by continuing the
Cheviot Financial health plan through the end of the applicable plan year or
otherwise.

  

  

7.6.7 Within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, MainSource shall
establish the Cincinnati Advisory Board. MainSource shall offer all of those
persons who serve on the Cheviot Financial Board of Directors at the Effective
Time (other than any Cheviot Financial board member who serves on the
MainSource Board of Directors) a position as a director on the Cincinnati
Advisory Board. Each member of the Cincinnati Advisory Board will receive fees
equal to the fees paid by MainSource to members of its other advisory boards
of directors.

  

  

7.7. Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

75  

  

 

 

 

  

7.7.1. MainSource shall maintain, or shall cause MainSource Bank to maintain,
in effect for six (6) years following the Effective Time, the current
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by Cheviot
Financial (provided, that MainSource may substitute therefor policies of at
least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not
materially less favorable) with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall MainSource be
required to expend pursuant to this Section 7.7.1, in the aggregate for such
policy or policies, more than $110,000 (the "Maximum Amount"); provided,
further, that if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or
procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, MainSource shall
maintain the most advantageous policies of directors' and officers' insurance
obtainable for an aggregate annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In
connection with the foregoing, Cheviot Financial agrees in order for
MainSource to fulfill its agreement to provide directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies for six (6) years to provide such insurer or
substitute insurer with such representations as such insurer may request with
respect to the reporting of any prior claims.

  

  

7.7.2. In addition to Section 7.7.1, after the Effective Time, MainSource
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or who has
been at any time before the date hereof or who becomes before the Effective
Time, an officer or director of Cheviot Financial or a Cheviot Financial
Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages,
costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees), liabilities or judgments or
amounts that are paid in settlement (which settlement shall require the prior
written consent of MainSource, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) of or in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, or administrative
(each a "Claim"), in which an Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be
made, a party or witness in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part
out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of
Cheviot Financial or a Cheviot Financial Subsidiary if such Claim pertains to
any matter of fact arising, existing or occurring before the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby), regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed
before, or after, the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Liabilities"), to the
fullest extent as would have been permitted by Cheviot Financial under Cheviot
Financial's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, to the extent not prohibited
by applicable law. MainSource shall pay expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any such action or proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law (to the extent not prohibited by
federal law) upon receipt of (i) an undertaking to repay such advance payments
if the Indemnified Party shall be adjudicated or determined to be not entitled
to indemnification in the manner set forth below, and (ii) a certification by
the Indemnified Party that he has acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Cheviot
Financial or any Cheviot Financial Subsidiary. Any Indemnified Party wishing
to claim indemnification under this Section 7.7.2 upon learning of any Claim,
shall notify MainSource (but the failure so to notify MainSource shall not
relieve MainSource from any liability which it may have under this Section
7.7.2, except to the extent such failure materially prejudices MainSource) and
shall deliver to MainSource the undertaking referred to in the previous
sentence. In the event of any such Claim (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time) (1) MainSource shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof (in which event the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense
of any such matter) and upon such assumption MainSource shall not be liable to
any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if MainSource elects not to assume such defense,
or counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

76  

  

 

 

 

  

Indemnified Parties that there are or are likely to be (whether or not any
have yet actually arisen) issues which raise conflicts of interest between
MainSource and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel reasonably satisfactory to them, and MainSource shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (2)
except to the extent otherwise required due to conflicts of interest,
MainSource shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only one
firm or counsel for all Indemnified Parties and the reasonable fees and
expenses of such law firm shall be paid promptly as statements are received
unless there is a conflict of interest that necessitates more than one law
firm, (3) MainSource shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), and (4) no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification hereunder with respect to a matter as to which (x) he shall
have been adjudicated in any proceeding not to have acted in good faith and in
a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best
interests of Cheviot Financial or any Cheviot Financial Subsidiary, or (y) in
the event that a proceeding is compromised or settled so as to impose any
liability or obligation upon an Indemnified Party, if there is a determination
that with respect to said matter said Indemnified Party did not act in good
faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the
best interests of Cheviot Financial or any Cheviot Financial Subsidiary. If
MainSource or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge
into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of
such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its
assets to any other entity, then and in each case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of MainSource shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.7. MainSource shall not be liable for
any payment under this Section 7.7.2 in connection with a claim made by an
Indemnified Party to the extent such Indemnified Party has otherwise actually
received payment under any insurance policy, agreement, or otherwise, of the
amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.

  

  

7.7.3. The obligations of MainSource provided under this Section 7.7 are
intended to be enforceable against MainSource directly by the Indemnified
Parties and shall be binding on all respective successors and permitted
assigns of MainSource. MainSource shall pay all reasonable costs, including
attorneys' fees, as incurred and in advance of the final disposition of any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation by any Indemnified Party in
successfully enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in
this Section 7.7 to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law;
provided, however such payment of costs shall be immediately reimbursed to
MainSource by such Indemnified Party if the Indemnified Party is not
successful enforcing the indemnity or other obligations provided for in this
Section 7.7. The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in
addition to any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under applicable
law.

  

  

7.7.4. Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Section 7.7 are
subject to and conditioned upon their compliance with Section 18(k) of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1828) and the regulations promulgated
thereunder by the FDIC (12 C.F.R. Part 359).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

77  

  

 

 

 

  

7.8. Stock Listing.

  

  

MainSource agrees to list on NASDAQ (or such other national securities
exchange on which the shares of the MainSource Common Stock shall be listed as
of the Closing Date), subject to official notice of issuance, the shares of
MainSource Common Stock to be issued in the Merger.

  

  

7.9. Stock and Cash Reserve.

  

  

MainSource agrees at all times from the date of this Agreement until the
Merger Consideration has been paid in full to reserve a sufficient number of
shares of MainSource Common Stock to fulfill its obligations under this
Agreement and to maintain, or to cause the MainSource Subsidiaries to
maintain, access to a sufficient amount of cash to fulfill its obligations
under this Agreement.

  

  

7.10. Rule 16b-3.

  

  

MainSource shall take all steps, as may be necessary or appropriate, to cause
the transactions contemplated by Article III and any other dispositions of
equity securities of Cheviot Financial (including derivative securities) or
acquisitions of equity securities of MainSource in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

  

7.11. Retention Pool.

  

  

MainSource shall establish a retention pool providing for retention bonuses to
be paid to Cheviot Financial employees, and the payments of such amounts will
be determined in the discretion of MainSource following consultation with
Cheviot Financial.

  

  

7.12. Employment Agreements/Consulting Agreements.

  

  

Effective at the Effective Time, and assuming such employees are employees of
Cheviot Financial immediately prior to the Effective Time, MainSource shall
enter into mutually-agreeable employment agreements and consulting agreements
with the Cheviot Financial employees, in accordance with the terms, set forth
on Schedule 7.12 to this Agreement, and in the form of employment agreement
that has been provided to Cheviot Financial as of the date of this Agreement.

supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or
the suspension of the qualifications of the shares of MainSource Common Stock
issuable pursuant to the Merger Registration Statement, or the initiation or
threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC

This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date,
whether before or after approval of the Merger by the stockholders of Cheviot
Financial:

  

  

11.1.1. By the mutual written agreement of MainSource and Cheviot Financial;

  

  

11.1.2. By either party (provided, that the terminating party is not then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach of any of the
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
other party, which breach by its nature cannot be cured prior to the
Termination Date or shall not have been cured within 30 days after written
notice of such breach by the terminating party to the other party; provided,
however, that neither party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 11.1.2 unless the breach of representation or
warranty, together with all other such breaches, would entitle the terminating
party not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby under Section
9.2.1 (in the case of a breach of a representation or warranty by Cheviot
Financial) or Section 9.3.1 (in the case of a breach of a representation or
warranty by MainSource);

written notice of such failure by the terminating party to the other party;
provided, however, that neither party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1.3 unless the breach of covenant or

by MainSource and Cheviot Financial; provided, that no party may terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1.4 if the failure of the Closing
to have occurred on or before said date was due to such party's material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained
in this Agreement;

  

  

11.1.5. By either party, if the stockholders of Cheviot Financial shall have
voted at the Cheviot Financial Stockholders Meeting (as it may be adjourned
and reconvened) and such vote shall not have been sufficient to approve the
Merger or this Agreement;

  

  

11.1.6. By either party if (i) any Bank Regulator whose approval or
nonobjection is required in connection with this Agreement and the

its obligations under Section 6.10 or 8.1 of this Agreement, (ii) if the
Cheviot Financial Board of Directors does not publicly recommend in the Proxy
Statement-Prospectus that the Cheviot Financial stockholders approve and adopt
this Agreement or if, after making the Cheviot Financial Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus for the Cheviot Financial Stockholders Meeting, the
Cheviot Financial Board of Directors makes a Cheviot Financial Subsequent
Determination, or (iii) if Cheviot Financial has received a Superior Proposal
and the Board of Directors of Cheviot Financial has entered into an
acquisition agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal, withdrawn its

MainSource Market Value shall be less than the Index Ratio minus 0.15;

  

  

Subject, however, to the following three sentences. If Cheviot Financial

(x) a quotient, the numerator of which is equal to the product of the Initial
MainSource Market Value, the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect), and the Index
Ratio minus 0.15 and the denominator of which is equal to the MainSource
Market Value on the Determination Date; or (y) the quotient determined by
dividing the Initial MainSource Market Value by the MainSource Market Value on
the Determination Date, and multiplying the quotient by the product of the
Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) and 0.80. If within such five business day
period, MainSource delivers written notice to Cheviot Financial that it
intends to proceed with the Merger by paying such additional consideration as
contemplated by the preceding sentence, and notifies Cheviot Financial of the
revised Exchange Ratio, then no termination shall have occurred pursuant to

"Willful Breach" shall mean a material breach that is a consequence of an act
undertaken by a party with the knowledge that the taking of the act would, or

parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however,
that neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by any party hereto without the prior written
consent of the other party. Except for the provisions of Article III this
Section 12.5 and as otherwise specifically provided in Section 7.7, which is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, and his or her heirs and representatives, this Agreement,
including the documents and instruments referred to in this Agreement, is not
intended and does not to confer upon any Person, other than the parties to
this Agreement, any rights or remedies under this Agreement.

There are no restrictions, agreements, promises, warranties, covenants or

12.7. Counterparts.

  

  

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts all of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement and each of which shall be deemed an
original. A facsimile copy or electronic transmission of a signature page
shall be deemed to be an original signature page.

  

  

12.8. Severability.

  

  

In the event that any one or more provisions of this Agreement shall for any
reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, by any court
of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement and the parties shall
use their reasonable efforts to substitute a valid, legal and enforceable
provision which, insofar as practical, implements the purposes and intents of
this Agreement.

  

  

12.9. Governing Law.

  

  

This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Indiana, without

12.10. Interpretation.

  

  

When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections or Exhibits, such
reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The recitals hereto constitute an integral part of this
Agreement. References to Sections include subsections, which are part of the
related Section (e.g., a section numbered "Section 5.5.1" would be part of
"Section 5.5" and references to "Section 5.5" would also refer to material
contained in the subsection described as "Section 5.5.1"). The table of
contents, index and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation". The phrases "the date of this Agreement", "the date
hereof" and terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires,
shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth in the Recitals to this
Agreement. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.

  

  

12.11. Specific Performance.

  

  

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
the provisions contained in this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to seek to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions thereof in the State of Indiana, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each party
agrees that it will not seek and will agree to waive any requirement for the
securing or posting of a bond in connection with the other party's seeking or
obtaining such injunctive relief. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a)
consents to submit itself to the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

91  

  

 

 

 

  

personal jurisdiction of the Circuit or Superior Courts of Marion County,
Indiana or the United States District Court for the Southern Division of
Indiana in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, and (c) agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in any court other than such courts.

  

  

12.12. Waiver of Jury Trial.

  

  

EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED ON, ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR ANY COURSE OF
CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, VERBAL OR WRITTEN STATEMENT OR ACTION OF ANY PARTY
HERETO.
