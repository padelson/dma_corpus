residents of such facilities are not required to be obtained prior to the
closing of the transactions contemplated hereby, and neither the application

SELLER OR THE BUYERS IN ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL BE EFFECTIVE IF MAILED TO SUCH PARTY AT THE ADDRESS LISTED IN
_ARTICLE XI_ ABOVE.

12.7 _Release_. Subject to the final sentence of _Section 8.2_, Ventas, Inc.,
on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (the "Ventas Parties"), does hereby
waive any claims, rights or remedies that the Ventas Parties may have against
Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. or its Affiliates (collectively, the "SSLI
Parties") with respect to, and releases the SSLI Parties from, any liability
for any obligations and liabilities incurred by an SSLI Party while a member
of UPREIT LLC or any Subject Company and for which it was liable as a member,
except any such obligations or liabilities incurred by an SSLI Party in
connection with this Agreement or the Seller Ancillary Documents.

12.8 _Assignment_. No party to this Agreement shall assign this Agreement or
its rights and obligations hereunder that survive Closing to any individual
or entity without the prior written consent of the other party or parties
hereto, which consent may be granted or withheld in the applicable partys
sole discretion, and any such assignment without such consent shall be null
and void _ab initio_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyers may assign
their respective rights under this Agreement that survive Closing to any
entity which is directly or indirectly majority owned and controlled by
Ventas, Inc., provided that the Buyers shall remain liable for all of their
obligations hereunder and for the performance of such assignee or assignees
and shall notify Seller of such assignment.

 

12.9 _Severability_. If any term, covenant, condition, provision or agreement
herein contained is held to be invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable by
any court of competent jurisdiction, the fact that such term, covenant,
condition, provision or agreement is invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable
shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of any other
term, covenant, condition, provision or agreement herein contained.

12.10 _Successors and Assigns_. All terms of this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective legal representatives, successors and assigns (subject to
_Section 12.8_).

 



19 12.11 _Interpretation_. Seller and the Buyers each acknowledge to the other
that both they and their counsel have reviewed and revised this Agreement and
that the normal rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to
be resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the
interpretation of this Agreement or any amendments or exhibits hereto.

12.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed an original; such
counterparts shall together constitute but one agreement.

12.13 _Facsimile or Electronic Signatures_. Signatures to this Agreement
transmitted by telecopy or electronic mail shall be valid and effective to
bind the party so signing. Each party agrees to promptly deliver an execution
original to this Agreement with its actual signature to the other party, but a
failure to do so shall not affect the enforceability of this Agreement, it
being expressly agreed that each party to this Agreement shall be bound by
its own telecopied or e-mailed signature and shall accept the telecopied or
e-mailed signature of the other party to this Agreement.

12.14 _Business Day_. If any action under this Agreement is required to be
taken on or by a day which is not a Business Day, the date on or by which such
action is required to be taken shall be extended until the next Business Day.

12.15 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. SELLER AND THE BUYERS EACH HEREBY
KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENTS CONTEMPLATED TO BE EXECUTED IN
CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALINGS, STATEMENTS
(WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN) OR ANY ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED IN ANY MANNER WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE PROPERTY (INCLUDING ANY
ACTION TO RESCIND OR CANCEL THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY CLAIMS OR DEFENSES
ASSERTING THAT THIS AGREEMENT WAS FRAUDULENTLY INDUCED OR IS OTHERWISE VOID OR
VOIDABLE). THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR SELLER AND THE BUYERS TO
ENTER INTO AND ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND THE DOCUMENTS TO BE DELIVERED BY
THE PARTIES HERETO AT CLOSING, AND SHALL SURVIVE THE CLOSING OR TERMINATION
OF THIS AGREEMENT. Each party hereby authorizes and empowers the other or
others to file this _Section 12.15_ and this Agreement with the clerk or
judge of any court of competent jurisdiction as a written consent to waiver
of jury trial.

12.16 _Confidentiality_. Except to the extent that any party hereto has made
a public disclosure in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12.16,
Seller and the Buyers, for the benefit of each other, hereby agree that each
of them will keep confidential the existence, terms, conditions and substance
of this Agreement and the terms, conditions and substance of any discussions
or negotiations regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided that each party may disclose such matters (i) to their respective
employees and advisors, including legal counsel, who have a need to know for
the purpose of consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) to the extent required by applicable law, or rule 

 



20  or regulation of any applicable governmental authority or stock exchange,
and (iii) to the Lenders for the purpose of seeking necessary consents to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and provided further that Seller
may disclose this Agreement to any prospective investor or financing source
that agrees in writing to maintain in strict confidence the existence and
terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and the Buyers
and their respective Affiliates shall each be permitted to make such public
disclosure as it deems appropriate with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that each of Seller,
on the one hand, and the Buyers, on the other hand, shall be required to
provide reasonable prior notice to the other of the timing and content of such
disclosure.
