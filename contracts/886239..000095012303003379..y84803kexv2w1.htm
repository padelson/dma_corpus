 Section 1.8 Effect on Capital Stock.  

 (a) At the Effective Time, and after giving effect to the Stock Split described in Section 5.14, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock owned by Riverwood or Merger Sub or held by the Company, all of which shall be canceled as provided in Section 1.8(c)), together with the associated Company Rights, shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Riverwood Common Stock (the "Exchange Ratio") and the associated Riverwood Rights (as defined in Section 5.14) (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Riverwood Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.5, the "Merger Consideration").  

 (b) As a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, at the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock (together with the associated Company Rights) and Company Convertible Preferred Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and (i) each beneficial owner of uncertificated book entry shares which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock (the "Book Entry Shares") and (ii) each holder of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock ("Common Certificates") or of Company Convertible Preferred Stock ("Preferred Certificates" and together with the Common Certificates and the Book Entry Shares, the "Certificates") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock (together with the associated Company Rights) or Company Convertible Preferred Stock, respectively, except as provided herein or by law.  

 (c) Each share of Company Common Stock and Company Convertible Preferred Stock owned by Riverwood, Merger Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Riverwood or held by the Company at the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and no stock of Riverwood or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.  

 Section 1.9 Company Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards.  

 (a) Each Company Stock Option (as defined in Section 3.2(b)) that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any such Company Stock Option that, in accordance with the terms thereof is to be converted into a right to receive a cash payment from the Company) shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company Stock Option (but taking into account any changes thereto provided for in the applicable   ##### 

   

Company Stock Incentive Plan (as defined in Section 3.2(b)(ii)), any
applicable employment agreement (including change in control agreements or
provisions) or in such option by reason of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby), that number of shares of Riverwood Common Stock
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio, rounded,
if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Riverwood Common Stock, at a
price per share (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent) equal to the
per share exercise price specified in such Company Stock Option divided by
the Exchange Ratio; provided that in the case of any Company Stock Option to
which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under
Section 422 of the Code, the option price, the number of shares subject to
such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of
the Code. On or prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all
actions necessary such that all Company Stock Options outstanding prior to
the Effective Time under the Company Stock Incentive Plans are treated in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentences.  

 (b) Each restricted share of Company Common Stock granted pursuant to a Company Stock Incentive Plan that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted, as of the Effective Time, into a number of shares of Riverwood Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares subject to the award and (ii) the Exchange Ratio; and the number of shares of Riverwood Common Stock as so determined shall be delivered to the holder of each such award as soon as practicable following the Effective Time. Such converted awards shall otherwise be subject to the same terms, conditions and, except as may otherwise have been agreed to by the Company and the holder thereof, restrictions, if any, as were applicable to such awards under the relevant Company Stock Incentive Plan (but taking into account any changes thereto provided for in the applicable Company Stock Incentive Plan by reason of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby). Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any such restricted shares of the Company Common Stock held by (i) the executives of the Company listed on Schedule 3.2(q) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (other than those listed in Exhibit 1(c) of the Merger Agreement), such restricted shares shall be fully vested as of the Effective Time, and (ii) the executives of the Company listed on Exhibit 1(c) hereto, such restricted shares shall be converted into restricted stock units of Riverwood in accordance with the terms of the New Employment Agreements.  

 (c) Prior to the Closing, Riverwood shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Riverwood Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company Stock Options or in connection with restricted shares or in connection with the settlement of stock accounts in accordance with this Section 1.9 or in connection with any other Company Benefit Plan (as defined in Section 8.11) for which shares of Riverwood Common Stock are required to be reserved for issuance.   ##### 

 

 (d) At the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall promptly pay all cash severance, excise taxes and gross-up payments and provide the other benefits and perform the other obligations under the employment agreements listed on Schedule 3.2(q) of the Company Disclosure Schedule to which the Company is a party with respect to the individuals listed on such Schedule whose employment terminates upon the Effective Time.  

 Section 1.10 Certain Adjustments. If, except as provided in Section 5.14, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Riverwood Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or different class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination or exchange of shares or a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other securities shall be declared with a record date within such period, or any similar event shall have occurred, the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.  

 Section 1.11 Associated Rights. References in Article I and Article II of this Agreement to Company Common Stock shall include, unless the context requires otherwise, the associated Company Rights and references in Article I and Article II of this Agreement to Riverwood Common Stock shall include, unless the context requires otherwise, the associated Riverwood Rights.  

ARTICLE II   

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   

 Section 2.1 Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Riverwood shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company to act as exchange agent hereunder (which entity shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) for the purpose of exchanging Certificates for the Merger Consideration (the "Exchange Agent"). At or prior to the Effective Time, Riverwood shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, certificates representing the Riverwood Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.8 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. Riverwood agrees to make available directly or indirectly to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.3. Any cash and certificates of Riverwood Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund".  

 Section 2.2 Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a   ##### 

   

Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and
which letter shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as
Riverwood may reasonably specify (such letter to be reasonably acceptable to
the Company prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for effecting
the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the applicable Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor in the case of holders of Common
Certificates (A) one or more shares of Riverwood Common Stock (which shall be
in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.8 (after taking into account
all shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder) and (B) a check
in the amount equal to the cash that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, consisting of cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of Riverwood Common Stock pursuant to Section
2.5 and dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.3. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to Section
2.3 or Section 2.5. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, one or
more shares of Riverwood Common Stock evidencing, in the aggregate, the
proper number of shares of Riverwood Common Stock, a check in the proper
amount of cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Riverwood Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends or other distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3, may be issued with respect
to such Company Common Stock to such a transferee if the Certificate
representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid.  

 Section 2.3 Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting.  

 (a) All shares of Riverwood Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Riverwood in respect of Riverwood Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement; provided, that no dividends or other distributions declared or made in respect of the Riverwood Common Stock with a record date that is 180 days or more after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of shares of Riverwood Common Stock   ##### 

   

issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time
of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of

     | (ii) Qualification. Each Riverwood Benefit Plan intended
to be qualified under section 401(a) of the Code, and the trust (if any)
forming a part thereof, has received a favorable determination letter from
the IRS as to its qualification under the Code and to the effect that each
such trust is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Code, and
nothing has  ##### 

   

      |   
---|--- 
     | occurred since the date of such determination letter that
could reasonably be expected to adversely affect such qualification or tax-
exempt status. All amendments and actions required to bring each Riverwood
Benefit Plan into conformity with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the
Code, and other applicable laws have been made or taken, except to the extent
such amendments or actions (A) are not required by law to be made or taken
until after the Closing Date and (B) are disclosed on Schedule 3.1(l)(ii) of
the Riverwood Disclosure Schedule.  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (iii) Compliance; Liability.  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (A) None of Riverwood, any of its Subsidiaries or
any Riverwood Related Person would be liable for any material
amount pursuant to section 4062, 4063 or 4064 of ERISA if any
Riverwood Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA (a
"Riverwood Title IV Plan") were to terminate as of the date hereof.
Each Riverwood Benefit Plan that is subject to the minimum funding standards
of ERISA or the Code satisfies such standards under sections 412 and 302 of
the Code and ERISA, respectively, and no such Riverwood Benefit Plan has
incurred an "accumulated funding deficiency" within the meaning of such
sections, whether or not waived. As of the last day of the most recently
ended fiscal year of each Riverwood Title IV Plan, the "projected
benefit obligations" (within the meaning of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 87) under each such
Riverwood Benefit Plan did not exceed the fair market value of the assets
of each such Riverwood Benefit Plan allocable to such "projected benefit
obligations," determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained
in the actuarial report prepared for such fiscal year of each such Riverwood
Benefit Plan.  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (B) None of Riverwood, any of its Subsidiaries or
any Riverwood Related Person has been involved in any transaction that could
cause Riverwood or any of its Subsidiaries to be subject to liability under
section 4069 or 4212 of ERISA. None of Riverwood, any of its Subsidiaries or
any Riverwood Related Person has incurred (either directly or indirectly,
including as a result of an indemnification obligation) any material
liability under or pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or the penalty, excise
Tax or joint and several liability provisions of the Code relating
to employee benefit plans and, to the knowledge of Riverwood, no event,
transaction or condition has occurred or exists that could result in any such
liability to Riverwood, any of its Subsidiaries or any Riverwood Related
Person. All contributions and premiums required to have been paid by
Riverwood, any of its Subsidiaries or any Riverwood Related Person to any
Riverwood Benefit Plan under the terms of any such plan or  ##### 

   

      |   
---|--- 
     | its related trust, insurance contract or other funding
arrangement, or pursuant to any applicable law (including ERISA and the Code)
or collective bargaining agreement have been paid within the time prescribed
by any such plan, agreement or applicable law, except to the extent failure
to do so would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material
Adverse Effect.  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (C) Each of the Riverwood Benefit Plans has been operated
and administered in all material respects in compliance with its terms, all
applicable laws and all applicable collective bargaining agreements. There
are no material pending or threatened claims by or on behalf of any
participant in any of the Riverwood Benefit Plans, or otherwise involving any
such Riverwood Benefit Plan or the assets of any Riverwood Benefit Plan,
other than routine claims for benefits. The Riverwood Benefit Plans are not
presently under audit or examination (nor has notice been received of a
potential audit or examination) by the IRS, the Department of Labor, or any
other governmental agency or entity, domestic or foreign, and no matters are
pending with respect to a Riverwood Benefit Plan under the IRSs Voluntary
Compliance Resolution program, its Closing Agreement Program, or
other similar programs.  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (D) No Riverwood Benefit Plan is a multiemployer plan
(as defined in section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or a "multiple employer plan"
within the meaning of section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA.  
     
     | (E) No person is or will become entitled to post-
employment benefits of any kind by reason of employment with Riverwood or
any of its Subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, death or medical
benefits (whether or not insured), other than (x) coverage mandated by
section 4980B of the Code or (y) retirement benefits payable under any
Riverwood Benefit Plan qualified under section 401(a) of the Code. The
entering into this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not result in an increase in the amount
of compensation or benefits or the acceleration of the vesting or timing of
payment of any compensation or benefits payable to or in respect of
any current or former employee, officer, director or independent contractor
of Riverwood or any of its Subsidiaries and no payment or deemed payment by
Riverwood or any of its Subsidiaries will arise or be made as a result of the
entering into of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that would not be deductible pursuant to
Section 280G of the Code.  ##### 

     

      |   
---|--- 
     | (F) Riverwood has classified all individuals (including
but not limited to independent contractors and leased
employees) appropriately under the Riverwood Benefit Plans, except where
a failure to do so would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a
Material Adverse Effect.  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (m) No Restrictions on the Merger; Takeover Statutes. The
Board of Directors of Riverwood has taken all necessary action to render
Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and any other
potentially applicable anti-takeover or similar statute or regulation or
provision of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws, or other
organizational or constitutive document or governing instruments of Riverwood
or any of its Subsidiaries, inapplicable to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

      |   
---|--- 
     | (ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company does not or will not, as the case may be, and the consummation

periods involved except as otherwise noted therein, and subject, in the case
of the unaudited interim financial statements, to the absence of notes and
normal and recurring year-end adjustments that have not been and are
not expected to be material in amount. All of such Company SEC Reports, as
of their respective dates (and as of the date of any amendment to the

with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

      |   
---|--- 
     | (i) Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports

Company, nor are there any judgments, decrees, injunctions, rules or orders

      |

     | (l) Employee Benefit Plans and Related Matters; ERISA.  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (i) Employee Benefit Plans. Schedule 3.2(l) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and correct list of each
Company Benefit Plan. With respect to each such Company Benefit Plan, the
Company has provided or made available to the Company complete and correct
copies of: (A) such Company Benefit Plan, if written, or a description of
such Company Benefit Plan if not written, and (B) to the extent applicable,
all trust agreements, insurance contracts or other funding arrangements,
the two most recent actuarial and trust reports, the two most recent Forms
5500 required to have been filed with the IRS or the Department of Labor or
any similar report filed with any comparable governmental authority in any
non-U.S. jurisdiction having jurisdiction over any employee benefit plan
sponsored by the Company, and all schedules thereto; the most recent
IRS determination letter; all current summary plan descriptions;

      |   
---|--- 
     | communicated to any current or former employee thereof any
intention or commitment to modify any Company Benefit Plan or to establish or
implement any other employee or retiree benefit or compensation plan or
arrangement.  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (ii) Qualification. Each Company Benefit Plan intended to
be qualified under section 401(a) of the Code, and the trust (if
any) forming a part thereof, has received a favorable determination letter
from the IRS as to its qualification under the Code and to the effect that
each such trust is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Code, and
nothing has occurred since the date of such determination letter that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect such qualification or tax-
exempt status. All amendments and actions required to bring each
Company Benefit Plan into conformity with the applicable provisions
of ERISA, the Code, and other applicable laws have been made or taken,
except to the extent such amendments or actions (A) are not required by law
to be made or taken until after the Closing Date and (B) are disclosed on
Schedule 3.2(l)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.  
     
     | (iii) Compliance; Liability.  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (A) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any Company Related Person would be liable for any material amount pursuant
to section 4062, 4063 or 4064 of ERISA if any Company Benefit Plan that is
subject to Title IV of ERISA (a "Company Title IV Plan") were to terminate as
of the date hereof. Each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to the minimum
funding standards of ERISA or the Code satisfies such standards
under sections 412 and 302 of the Code and ERISA, respectively, and no such
Company Benefit Plan has incurred an "accumulated funding deficiency" within
the meaning of such sections, whether or not waived. As of the last day of
the most recently ended fiscal year of each Company Title IV Plan, the
"projected benefit obligations" (within the meaning of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 87) under each such Company Benefit
Plan did not exceed the fair market value of the assets of each such
Company Benefit Plan allocable to such "projected benefit
obligations," determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained
in the actuarial report prepared for such fiscal year of each such Company
Benefit Plan.  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (B) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any Company Related Person has been involved in any transaction that could
cause Company, any of its Subsidiaries or, following the Closing Riverwood or
any Riverwood Related Person to be subject to material  ##### 

   

      |   
---|--- 
     | liability under section 4069 or 4212 of ERISA. None of Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Related Person has incurred (either
directly or indirectly, including as a result of an indemnification
obligation) any material liability under or pursuant to Title I or IV of
ERISA or the penalty, excise Tax or joint and several liability provisions of
the Code relating to employee benefit plans and, to the knowledge of Company,
no event, transaction or condition has occurred or exists that could
result in any such liability to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
any Company Related Person or, following the Closing Riverwood or
any Riverwood Related Person. All contributions and premiums required to
have been paid by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Related
Person to any Company Benefit Plan under the terms of any such plan or its
related trust, insurance contract or other funding arrangement, or pursuant
to any applicable law (including ERISA and the Code) or collective bargaining
agreement have been paid within the time prescribed by any such plan,
agreement or applicable law, except to the extent failure to do so would
not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material
Adverse Effect.  
     
     | (C) Each of the Company Benefit Plans has been operated
and administered in all material respects in compliance with its terms, all
applicable laws and all applicable collective bargaining agreements. There
are no material pending or threatened claims by or on behalf of any
participant in any of the Company Benefit Plans, or otherwise involving any
such Company Benefit Plan or the assets of any Company Benefit Plan, other
than routine claims for benefits. The Company Benefit Plans are
not presently under audit or examination (nor has notice been received of a

of since such date or as may be disposed of after the date hereof
in accordance herewith in either case in the ordinary course of business

defined in Section 3.2(t)(iii)) setting forth information sufficient

      |   
---|---

and occupy the premises and rights demised thereunder free and clear of any

Company Real Property in the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries does not violate any instrument of record or agreement affecting
the Company Real Property, except for such violations as individually and in
the aggregate would not have or result in a Material Adverse Effect. No
current use by the Company and its Subsidiaries of the Company Real Property
is dependent on a nonconforming use or other governmental approval, the

Material Adverse Effect.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   

 Section 5.1 Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders Approval.  

 (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC proxy materials reasonably acceptable to Riverwood which shall constitute the Company Proxy Statement/Prospectus (such proxy statement/prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Company Proxy Statement/Prospectus") and Riverwood shall prepare and file a registration statement on Form S-4 reasonably acceptable to the Company with respect to the issuance of Riverwood Common Stock in the Merger (the "Form S-4"). The Form S-4 and the Company Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Each of Riverwood and the Company shall use reasonable   ##### 

   

best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective by the SEC as promptly
as practicable after the date hereof and to keep the Form S-4 effective as
long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated thereby. Riverwood and the Company shall, as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other party copies
of any written comments and advise the other party of any oral comments, with
respect to the Form S-4 or the Company Proxy Statement/Prospectus received
from the SEC. Riverwood and the Company shall provide the other party with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement
to the Form S-4 or the Company Proxy Statement/Prospectus prior to filing
such with the SEC, and will promptly provide the other party with a copy of
all such filings made with the SEC. Notwithstanding any other provision
herein to the contrary, no amendment or supplement (including by
incorporation by reference) to the Company Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Form S-4 shall be made without the approval of both parties, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be
mailed to the Companys stockholders as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Riverwood shall
take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in
which it is not now so qualified or to file a general consent to service of
process) required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in
connection with the issuance of Riverwood Common Stock in the Merger and the
Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders
of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any
such action. Each party shall advise the other party, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective,
the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the
Riverwood Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the
Company Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4. If at any time prior to
the Effective Time any information relating to Riverwood or the Company, or
any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by Riverwood or the Company which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Company Proxy
Statement/Prospectus so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent required by
law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
stockholders of Riverwood and the Company.  

 (b) The Company shall duly take (subject to compliance with the provisions of Section 3.1(e), Section 3.2(e) and all applicable laws (provided that the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to ensure that such representations are true and correct)) all necessary, proper and advisable action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a   ##### 

   

meeting of its stockholders on a date as soon as reasonably practicable (the
"Company Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval with respect to the adoption of this Agreement and shall
take all lawful action to solicit the adoption of this Agreement by the
Company Stockholder Approval; and the Board of Directors of the Company shall
recommend adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company to
the effect as set forth in Section 3.2(f) (the "Company Recommendation"), and
shall not withdraw, modify or qualify (or propose to withdraw, modify or
qualify) in any manner adverse to Riverwood such recommendation or take any
action or make any statement in connection with the Company Stockholders
Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation (collectively, a "Change in the
Company Recommendation"); provided, that the Board of Directors of the
Company may (upon the recommendation of a majority of the Independent
Directors) make a Change in the Company Recommendation (i) pursuant to
Section 5.4 hereof or (ii) if the Companys Board of Directors determines in
good faith (after consultation with its legal and financial advisors) that
not making a Change in the Company Recommendation would violate the fiduciary
duties owed by the Companys Board of Directors to the Companys
stockholders, and provided further, that the foregoing shall not prohibit
accurate disclosure (and such disclosure shall not be deemed to be a Change
in the Company Recommendation) of factual information regarding the business,
financial condition or results of operations of Riverwood or the Company
(provided that the Board of Directors of the Company does not withdraw,
modify or qualify (or propose to withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner
adverse to Riverwood its recommendation) in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or otherwise, to the extent such information, facts,
identity or terms is required to be disclosed under applicable law.
Notwithstanding any Change in the Company Recommendation, this Agreement
shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Company
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of adopting the Agreement and approving
the Merger; provided, that this Agreement shall not be required to be
submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders
Meeting if this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Section 7.1
hereof.  

 Section 5.2 Access to Information/Employees.  

 (a) Upon reasonable notice, each party shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other authorized representatives of the other party reasonable access during normal business hours, during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments, records, officers and employees and, during such period, such party shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed, published, announced or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities laws, as applicable (other than documents which such party is not permitted to disclose under applicable law), and (ii) all other information concerning it and its   ##### 

   

business, properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request
(including consultation on a regular basis with such parties, agents,
advisors, attorneys and representatives with respect to litigation matters);
provided, however, that either party may restrict the foregoing access to the
extent that (A) in the reasonable judgment of such party, any law, treaty,
rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to such party
requires such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any
such properties or information, (B) in the reasonable judgment of such party,
the information is subject to confidentiality obligations to a third party,
(C) such disclosure would result in disclosure of any trade secrets of third
parties or (D) disclosure of any such information or document could result in
the loss of attorney-client privilege; provided, however, that with respect
to this clause (D), the parties and/or counsel for the parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts to enter into such joint defense agreements or
other arrangements, as appropriate, so as to avoid the loss of attorney-
client privilege. Any such information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.2
as well as any information about an Acquisition Proposal disclosed by the
Company to Riverwood pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
("Confidential Information") will be used solely for the purpose of
consideration or performance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any other agreement related hereto and will be kept confidential
by the party obtaining such information and all persons obtaining such
information on such partys behalf or who obtain such information from such
party. Confidential Information shall not include information that is or
becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of
disclosure by a party or its Representatives (as defined
below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information may be
disclosed by a party (x) to its directors, officers, employees,
representatives (including, without limitation, financial advisors, attorneys
and accountants) or agents (collectively "Representatives") who need to know
such information if the party informs such Representatives of the
confidential nature of such information and directs them to treat such
information confidentially and to use such information for no purpose other
than as specifically permitted by the Agreement and (y) if the party is
legally required to make such disclosure as a result of a court order,
subpoena or similar legal duress, provided that prior to such disclosure, the
disclosing party gives to the other party prompt written notice of its
receipt of such order or subpoena or similar document so that the other party
has a reasonable opportunity prior to disclosure to obtain a protective order
(if disclosure of Confidential Information is so required, the disclosing
party shall disclose only that portion of such information that is so
required and shall assist the other party in obtaining protective orders or
undertakings that confidential treatment will be accorded to any
such information furnished). In the event of termination of this Agreement,
each party will promptly return to the other party all Confidential
Information in its possession (including all written materials prepared or
supplied by or on its behalf containing or reflecting any Confidential
Information) and will not retain any copies, extracts or other reproductions
in whole or in part of any Confidential Information. Any work papers,
memoranda or other writings prepared by a party or its Representatives
derived from or incorporating any Confidential Information shall be destroyed
promptly upon termination   ##### 

   

of this Agreement, with such destruction confirmed to the other party in
writing. Any oral Confidential Information will continue to be subject to the
terms of this Section 5.2. Each party shall be responsible for the breach of
the terms of this Section 5.2 by its Representative. Any investigation by
Riverwood or the Company shall not affect the representation and warranties
of the Company and Riverwood, as the case may be. In the event of any
conflict between the terms of this Section 5.2 and the terms of a
Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of this Section 5.2 shall control.  

 Section 5.3 Reasonable Best Efforts.  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable laws and regulations to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable after the date hereof, including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings and other documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) taking all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain all such material consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, orders and approvals.

given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) permit the other
party, or the other partys legal counsel, to review any communication given
by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference
with, the DOJ, the FTC or any such other Governmental Entity or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person and
(iv) give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and conferences. For purposes of this Agreement, "Regulatory Law"

foreign investment or (ii) actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition.  

 (c) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Regulatory Law or if any suit is instituted by any Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Regulatory Law, each of Riverwood and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or challenge as such Governmental Entity or private party may have to such transactions under such Regulatory Law so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

surviving or resulting from such transaction (or the ultimate parent entity
thereof) or, regardless of the percentage of voting securities held by such
stockholders, if any Person shall beneficially own, directly or indirectly,

the individuals comprising the board of directors of the Company prior to
such transaction do not constitute a majority of the board of directors of

recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction upon the
consummation of which the Companys stockholders would in the aggregate

reimburse Riverwood for all  #####

   (g)  |   | For purposes of this Section 7.2, "Permitted Reason" means
with respect to (i) calling or holding the Company Stockholder Meeting, that
the Company Stockholder Meeting shall not have occurred because of the
failure of the SEC to declare the Form S-4 Effective and (ii) obtaining
Company Stockholder Approval, that Company Stockholder Approval shall not
have been obtained because of the failure of the Family Stockholders to vote
in accordance with the Voting Agreement.  
  

 Section 7.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of the Company and Riverwood, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange requires further approval by such stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.  

 Section 7.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

 (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than Section 1.9(d) and Section 5.5 (which are intended to be for the benefit, respectively, only of the individuals party to the employment agreements listed on Schedule 3.2(q) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and may be enforced by such individuals) and Section 5.7 (which is intended to be for the benefit of the individuals covered thereby, and may be enforced by such individuals).  

 Section 8.6 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to its principles and rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require the application of the law of another jurisdiction.  

 Section 8.7 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in   ##### 

   

order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.  

 Section 8.8 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other party, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

Each of Riverwood and the Company irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns may be brought and determined in the Chancery or other Courts of the State of Delaware, and each of Riverwood and the Company hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each of Riverwood and the Company hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to lawfully serve process (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper and (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.  

 Section 8.10 Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms.

Each Family Stockholder shall promptly advise Riverwood orally and in writing of (x) any proposal for an Acquisition Proposal or any request for information with respect to any proposal for an Acquisition Proposal received by such Family Stockholder or any of his agents, advisors or other representatives, the material terms and conditions of such proposal for an Acquisition Proposal or request and the identity of the person making such proposal for an Acquisition Proposal or request (and provide Riverwood with copies of any written proposal for an Acquisition Proposal or amendments or supplements thereto) and (y) any changes in any such proposal for an Acquisition Proposal or request.   ##### 

  

ARTICLE IV   

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   

 Section 4.1 No Disposition or Encumbrance of Subject Shares. Except as provided in the next to the last sentence of this Section 4.1, each Family Stockholder agrees not to, directly or indirectly, (i) Transfer or enter into any agreement, option or other arrangement (including any profit sharing arrangement) with respect to the Transfer of, any Subject Shares to any Person, other than in accordance with the Merger Agreement or (ii) grant any proxies, deposit any Subject Shares into any voting trust or enter into any voting arrangement, whether by proxy, voting agreement or otherwise, with respect to the Subject Shares, other than pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to the next to the last sentence of this Section 4.1, each Family Stockholder further agrees not to commit or agree to take any of the foregoing actions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Family Stockholder shall have the right to Transfer its Subject Shares to a Permitted Transferee (as defined in this Section 4.1) of such Family Stockholder if and only if such Permitted Transferee shall have agreed in writing, in a manner reasonably acceptable in form and substance to Riverwood, (i) to accept such Subject Shares subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (ii) to be bound by this Agreement and to agree and acknowledge that such Person shall constitute a Family Stockholder for all purposes of this Agreement. "Permitted Transferee" means, with respect to any Family Stockholder, (A) any other Family Stockholder, (B) a spouse or lineal descendant (whether natural or adopted), sibling, parent, heir, executor, administrator, testamentary trustee, lifetime trustee or legatee of such Family Stockholder or Adolph Coors, Jr., (C) any trust, the trustees of which include only the Persons named in clause (A) or (B) and the beneficiaries of which include only the Persons named in clause (A) or (B), (D) any corporation, limited liability company or partnership, the stockholders, members or general or limited partners of which include only the Persons named in clause (A) or (B), or (E) if such Family Stockholder is a trust, the beneficiary or beneficiaries authorized or entitled to receive distributions from such trust.  

 Section 4.2 Disclosure. Each of the Family Stockholders hereby permits Riverwood to publish and disclose in the Registration Statement of Riverwood to be filed on Form S-4 with respect to the Merger and all documents and schedules filed with the SEC in connection therewith, such Family Stockholders identity and ownership of the Subject Shares and, with the prior approval of the Family Representative, the nature of such Family Stockholders commitments, arrangements and understandings under this Agreement.  

 Section 4.3 Waiver of Appraisal Rights. Each of the Family Stockholders hereby waives any rights of appraisal or rights to dissent from the Merger that it may have under Article 113 of the Colorado Business Corporation Act (the "CBCA").   ##### 

  

 Section 4.4 Reasonable Efforts. Each Family Stockholder shall use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement; provided, however, that this Section 4.4 shall not require the Family Stockholders to interfere with the composition or actions of the Companys Board of Directors or to acquire additional securities nor provide financing to the Company.  

 Section 4.5 Family Representative. Each Family Stockholder hereby designates and appoints (and each Permitted Transferee of each such Family Stockholder is hereby deemed to have so designated and appointed) Jeffrey H. Coors and, in the case of his inability to act, William K. Coors (the "Family Representative"), as its attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution for each of them, to serve as the representative of such Family Stockholder to perform all such acts as are required, authorized or contemplated by this Agreement to be performed by such Family Stockholder (including the voting of the Subject Shares in accordance with Sections 3.1(a) and (b)), and hereby acknowledges that the Family Representative shall be authorized to take any action so required, authorized or contemplated by this Agreement. Each such Family Stockholder further acknowledges that the foregoing appointment and designation shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest and shall survive the death or incapacity of such Family Stockholder. Each such Family Stockholder hereby authorizes (and each such Permitted Transferee of such Family Stockholder shall be deemed to have authorized) the other parties hereto to disregard any notices or other action taken by such Family Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement, except for notices and actions taken by the Family Representative. Riverwood is and will be entitled to rely on any action so taken or any notice given by any Family Representative and is and will be entitled and authorized to give notices only to the Family Representative for any notice contemplated by this Agreement to be given to any such Family Stockholder. A successor to the Family Representative may be chosen by the holders of a majority of the shares held by the Family Stockholders; provided that notice thereof is given by the new Family Representative to Riverwood.  

 Section 4.6 Irrevocable Proxy. Notwithstanding the generality of Section 4.5, each Family Stockholder hereby constitutes and appoints the Family Representative with full power of substitution, as the proxy pursuant to the provisions of Article 107 of the CBCA and attorney of such Family Stockholder, and hereby authorizes and empowers the Family Representative to represent, vote and otherwise act (by voting at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company, by written consent in lieu thereof or otherwise) with respect to the Subject Shares owned or held by such Family Stockholder regarding the matters referred to in Sections 3.1(a) and (b) until the termination of this Agreement, to the same extent and with the same effect as such Family Stockholder might or could do under applicable law, rules and regulations. The proxy granted pursuant to the   ##### 

  

immediately preceding sentence is coupled with an interest and shall
be irrevocable. Each Family Stockholder hereby revokes any and all
previous proxies or powers of attorney granted with respect to any of the
Subject Shares owned or held by such Family Stockholder regarding the matters
referred to in Sections 3.1(a) and (b).  

 Section 4.7 Conversion of Preferred.  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (a) At the Closing and immediately prior to the Effective
Time (as such terms are defined in the Merger Agreement), the Grover C.
Coors Trust shall convert all of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock held
by such trust into shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms
of the Articles of Incorporation of the Company as amended by the
Companys Board of Directors on August 14, 2000 (the "Share Conversion").  
     
     | (b) In consideration of the Share Conversion, promptly after
such conversion Riverwood shall pay by wire transfer, to an account
or accounts specified by not less than three days notice from the
Family Representative to Riverwood, funds in an amount equal to the
present value, calculated using a discount rate of 8.5%, of the dividend
payments payable to the Series B Preferred Stock from the Effective Time of
the Merger through the first date as of which the Company may redeem
the Series B Preferred Stock.  
  

 Section 4.8 Additional Consideration.  

 (a) In the event that the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated under circumstances where Riverwood is entitled to receive the Termination Fee (as defined in and in accordance with the Merger Agreement), each Family Stockholder shall pay to Riverwood, on demand, an amount equal to such Family Stockholders pro rata share (based on the number of subject shares held by such stockholder on the date hereof, treating the Series B Preferred Stock on an as converted basis) of (i) 75% of the first $20 million of all Profit (as defined in Section 4.8(b)) earned by the Family Stockholders, collectively, and (ii) 50% of the next $40 million of all Profit earned by the Family Stockholders, collectively, in each case from the consummation of any Business Combination (as defined in the Merger Agreement) that is consummated within two years of such termination.   

 (b) For purposes of this Section 4.8, the "Profit" of the Family Stockholders, collectively, from any Business Combination shall equal (i) the aggregate consideration received by the Family Stockholders pursuant to such Business Combination, valuing any non-cash consideration (including any residual interest in the Company) at its Fair Market Value on the date of the consummation of the Business Combination plus (ii) the Fair Market Value, determined as of the date of disposition, of all Subject Shares of the Family Stockholders disposed of after the termination of the Merger Agreement and prior to the date of the consummation of the Business Combination minus (iii) the Fair Market Value of all Subject Shares of the Family  ##### 

  

Stockholders, determined as of (x) the day immediately prior to date of the
Merger Agreement or (y) the day immediately prior to the date that
the Company first receives notice of or otherwise becomes aware of an
Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement), whichever date of
determination yields a lower Fair Market Value.   

 (c) In the event that (i) prior to the Effective Time, a Superior Proposal shall have been made and (ii) the Effective Time of the Merger shall have occurred and Riverwood for any reason shall have increased the amount of the Merger Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement) payable over that set forth in the Merger Agreement in effect on the date hereof, the Family Stockholders hereby agree that they will not be entitled to receive, and shall waive any right to receive, 50% of any such additional Merger Consideration that would otherwise have been received by the Family Stockholders, and that the full amount of any such additional Merger Consideration shall be payable by Riverwood only with respect to shares of the Common Stock held by Persons other than the Family Stockholders.   

 (d) For purposes of this Section 4.8, the Fair Market Value of any non-cash consideration consisting of:   

      | (i)  |   | securities listed on a national
securities exchange or traded on the NASDAQ/NMS shall be equal to
the average closing price per share of such security as reported on such
exchange or the NASDAQ/NMS for the ten trading days prior to the date of
determination; and  
---|---|---|--- 
     
     | (ii)  |   | consideration which is other than cash
or securities of the form specified in clause (i) of this Section 4.8(d)
shall be determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking
firm mutually agreed upon by the parties within 10 business days of the event
requiring selection of such banking firm; provided, however, that if the
parties are unable to agree within two business days after the date of such
event as to the investment banking firm, then the parties shall each select
one firm, and those firms shall select a third investment banking firm,
which third firm shall make such determination; provided further, that the
fees and expenses of such investment banking firm shall be borne equally by
Riverwood, on the one hand, and the Family Stockholders, on the other hand.
The determination of the investment banking firm shall be binding upon
the parties.  
  

 (e) Any payment of profit under this Section 4.8 shall (i) if paid in cash, be paid by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Riverwood and (ii) if paid through transfer of freely tradeable securities, be paid through delivery of such securities, suitably endorsed for transfer.    ##### 

  

ARTICLE V   

STOCKHOLDER CAPACITY   

 Section 5.1 Stockholder Capacity. No Person executing this Agreement who is or becomes during the term hereof a director or officer of the Company shall be deemed to make any agreement or understanding in this Agreement in such Persons capacity as a director or officer. Each Family Stockholder is entering into this Agreement solely in its capacity as the record holder or beneficial owner of, or the trustee of a trust whose beneficiaries are the beneficial owners of, such Family Stockholders Subject Shares and nothing herein shall limit or affect any actions taken by a Family Stockholder in its capacity as a director or officer of the Company to the extent specifically permitted by the Merger Agreement or following the termination of the Merger Agreement.  

ARTICLE VI   

TERMINATION   

 Section 6.1 Termination. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier of (x) the Effective Time and (y) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, except that (i) the provisions of Section 4.8 of this Agreement shall survive any such termination and (ii) a termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party from liability for any breach hereof.  

ARTICLE VII   

MISCELLANEOUS   

 Section 7.1 Additional Shares. In the event any Family Stockholder becomes the legal or beneficial owner of any additional shares or other securities of the Company (the "Additional Securities"), any securities into which such shares or securities may be converted or exchanged and any securities issued in replacement of, or as a dividend or distribution on, or otherwise in respect of, such shares or securities, then the terms of this Agreement shall apply to such securities. Each Family Stockholder agrees not to purchase or in any other manner acquire any Additional Securities, except for (x) the purchase or other acquisition pursuant to Section 4.1 of Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock that is held by another Family Stockholder as of the date hereof and (y) with respect to any Family Stockholder who is an employee of the Company, pursuant to a Company Benefit Plan (as defined in the Merger Agreement).  

 Section 7.2 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to   ##### 

  

its principles or rules of conflicts of laws to the extent that
such principles or rules would require or permit the application of the law
of another jurisdiction.   

 Section 7.3 Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees that any legal suit, action or proceeding brought by any party hereto arising out of or based upon this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be brought in the Courts of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (each, a "Delaware Court"), (ii) waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding brought in any Delaware Court, and any claim that any such action or proceeding brought in any Delaware Court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, and (iii) submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of Delaware Courts in any suit, action or proceeding. Each of the parties agrees that a judgment in any suit, action or proceeding brought in a Delaware Court shall be conclusive and binding upon it and may be enforced in any other courts to whose jurisdiction it is or may be subject, by suit upon such judgment.   

 Section 7.4 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES AGREES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION OR VALIDITY OF THIS AGREEMENT.   

 Section 7.5 Specific Performance. Each Family Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that (i) the obligations and agreements of such Family Stockholder contained in this Agreement relate to special, unique and extraordinary matters, (ii) Riverwood is and will be relying on such covenants in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and the performance of its obligations under the Merger Agreement, and (iii) a violation of any of the terms of such Family Stockholders obligations or agreements will cause Riverwood irreparable injury for which adequate remedies are not available at law. Therefore, each Family Stockholder agrees that Riverwood shall be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or such other equitable relief (without the requirement to post bond) as a court of competent jurisdiction may deem necessary or appropriate to restrain such Family Stockholder from committing any violation of such covenants, obligations or agreements. These injunctive remedies are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies Riverwood may have.   

 Section 7.6 Amendment, Waivers, etc. Neither this Agreement nor any term hereof may be amended or otherwise modified other than by an instrument in writing signed by Riverwood and the Family Representative. No provision of this Agreement   ##### 

  

may be waived, discharged or terminated other than by an instrument
in writing signed by the party against whom the enforcement of such
waiver, discharge or termination is sought.  

 Section 7.7 Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall not be assignable or otherwise transferable by a party without the prior consent of the other parties, and any attempt to so assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement without such consent shall be void and of no effect; provided that (i) any Permitted Transferee acquiring any Subject Shares in accordance with Section 4.1 shall, on the terms provided in Section 4.1, become a "Family Stockholder", and (ii) Riverwood may, in its sole discretion, assign or transfer all or any of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Riverwood. This Agreement shall be binding upon the respective heirs, successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns of the parties hereto. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as giving any Person, other than the parties hereto and their heirs, successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns, any right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision hereof.  

 Section 7.8 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses.  

 Section 7.9 Notices. All notices, consents, requests, instructions, approvals and other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed validly given upon personal delivery or one day after being sent by overnight courier service or by telecopy (so long as for notices or other communications sent by telecopy, the transmitting telecopy machine records electronic confirmation of the due transmission of the notice), at the following address or telecopy number, or at such other address or telecopy number as a party may designate to the other parties:        |   |

 Section 7.10 Remedies. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies provided herein shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.  

 Section 7.11 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public policy, or unenforceable for any reason, it shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible, in order to achieve the intent of the parties hereto to the maximum extent possible. In any event, the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement in that jurisdiction or the validity or enforceability of this Agreement, including that provision, in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the terms of this Agreement remain as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.   ##### 

  

 Section 7.12 Integration. This Agreement, including all exhibits and schedules attached hereto, constitutes the full and entire understanding and agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede any and all prior understandings or agreements relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof.  

 Section 7.13 Section Headings. The article and section headings of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are not to be considered in construing this Agreement.  

 Section 7.14 Further Assurances. From time to time at the request of Riverwood, and without further consideration, each Family Stockholder shall execute and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered such additional documents and instruments and take all such further action as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the matters contemplated by this Agreement.  

 Section 7.15 Stop Transfer. Each of the Family Stockholders agrees that such Family Stockholder shall not request that the Company register the transfer (book-entry or otherwise) of any certificate or uncertificated interest representing any Subject Shares, unless such transfer is made in compliance with this Agreement.  

 Section 7.16 Public Announcements. Each Family Stockholder will consult with Riverwood before issuing, and provide Riverwood with the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger Agreement, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange (including, but not limited to, the New York Stock Exchange).  

 Section 7.17 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

FORM OF RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION   

OF   

[ ]   

 I, [ ], being the [ ] of [ ], a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), do hereby certify:  

 1. The name of the Corporation is [ ]. The original name of the Corporation was "New River Holding, Inc."  

 2. The original Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on December 7, 1995, under the name New River Holding, Inc. The Certificate of Incorporation was amended on March 27, 1996 in order to change the name of the corporation to Riverwood Holding, Inc. (as so amended, the "Original Certificate of Incorporation").  

 3. This Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation at a duly convened meeting of the Board of Directors on March 24, 2003 and by a written consent of the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon dated March 24, 2003, in accordance with the provisions of Sections 141, 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as applicable.  

 4. The Original Certificate of Incorporation is hereby further amended and restated so as to read in its entirety as follows:  

ARTICLE I   

NAME OF CORPORATION   

 The name of the corporation is [ ] (the "Corporation").  

ARTICLE II   

REGISTERED OFFICE   

 The Corporations registered office in the State of Delaware is at 1105 North Market, Suite 1300, City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, Delaware 19801. The name of its registered agent at such address is Delaware Corporate Management, Inc.   ##### 

  

ARTICLE III   

PURPOSE   

 The nature of the business of the Corporation and its purpose is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL").  

ARTICLE IV   

CAPITAL STOCK   

 Section 1\. Authorized Stock. The total number of shares of stock that the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 550,000,000 shares, consisting of (a) 500,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), and (b) 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Preferred Stock"), issuable in one or more series as hereinafter provided. The number of authorized shares of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL or any corresponding provision hereinafter enacted.  

 Effective upon the filing of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Effective Time"), and in each case without any further action of the Corporation or any stockholder, (i) each share of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Corporation which immediately prior to the Effective Time was outstanding or held as treasury stock shall be reclassified into and become 15.21 shares of Common Stock and (ii) each share of Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Corporation which immediately prior to the Effective Time was outstanding or held as treasury stock shall be reclassified into and become 15.21 shares of Common Stock (such reclassifications collectively, the "Reclassification"). No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon the Reclassification. If any fraction of a share of Common Stock would otherwise be issuable upon the Reclassification, the Corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional shares of Common Stock, pay to each stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share an amount in cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value per share of the Common Stock, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, computed to the nearest whole cent.   ##### 

  

 Section 2\. Provisions Relating to the Common Stock.  

 (a) Voting. Except as otherwise provided in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or by applicable law, each holder of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled, with respect to each share of Common Stock held by such holder, to one vote in person or by proxy on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of Common Stock, whether voting separately as a class or otherwise.  

 (b) Dividends and Distributions. Subject to the preferences and rights, if any, applicable to shares of Preferred Stock or any series thereof, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such dividends and other distributions in cash, property, stock or otherwise as may be declared thereon by the Board of Directors at any time and from time to time out of assets or funds of the Corporation legally available therefor.  

 (c) Liquidation Rights. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation, after payment or provision for payment of the debts and other liabilities of the Corporation, and subject to the preferences and rights, if any, applicable to shares of Preferred Stock or any series thereof, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive all of the remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders, ratably in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held by them.  

 Section 3\. Provisions Relating to the Preferred Stock.  

 (a) The Preferred Stock may be issued at any time and from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors is hereby authorized to provide for the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series and, by filing a certificate of designation pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL (hereinafter referred to as a "Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation"), to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, of shares of each such series.  

 (b) The authority of the Board of Directors with respect to each series of Preferred Stock shall include, but not be limited to, determination of the following:  

      | (i)  |   | the designation of the series, which may be
by distinguishing number, letter or title;  
---|---|---|--- 
     
     | (ii)  |   | the number of shares of the series, which number
the Board of Directors may thereafter (except where otherwise provided in the
applicable Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation) increase or  ##### 

  

      |   |   | decrease (but not below the number of shares thereof
then outstanding);  
---|---|---|--- 
     
     | (iii)  |   | the preferences, if any, and
relative, participating, optional or other special rights, if any, and the
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, of the series;  
     
     | (iv)  |   | whether dividends, if any, shall be cumulative or
noncumulative and the dividend rate, if any, of the series;  
     
     | (v)  |   | whether dividends, if any, shall be payable in cash,
in kind or otherwise;  
     
     | (vi)  |   | the dates on which dividends, if any, shall
be payable;  
     
     | (vii)  |   | the redemption rights and price or prices, if any,
for shares of the series;  
     
     | (viii)  |   | the terms and amount of any sinking fund provided
for the purchase or redemption of shares of the series;  
     
     | (ix)  |   | the amounts payable on shares of the series in the
event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up
of the affairs of the Corporation;  
     
     | (x)  |   | whether the shares of the series shall
be convertible into or exchangeable for shares of any other class or series,
or any other security, of the Corporation or any other corporation, and, if
so, the specification of such other class or series or such other security,
the conversion or exchange price or prices or rate or rates, any
adjustments thereof, the date or dates as of which such shares shall
be convertible or exchangeable and all other terms and conditions upon which
such conversion or exchange may be made;  
     
     | (xi)  |   | restrictions on the issuance of shares of the same
series or of any other class or series;  
     
     | (xii)  |   | whether or not the holders of the shares of such
series shall have voting rights, in addition to the voting rights provided by
law, and if so, the terms of such voting rights, which may provide, among
other things and subject to the other provisions of this Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, that each share of such series shall carry one
vote or more or less than one vote per share, that the holders of such series
shall be entitled to vote on certain matters as  ##### 

  

      |   |   | a separate class (which for such purpose may be
comprised solely of such series or of such series and one or more other
series or classes of stock of the Corporation); and  
---|---|---|--- 
     
     | (xiii)  |   | such other rights and provisions with respect to
any series that the Board of Directors may provide.  
  

 (c) The Common Stock shall be subject to the express terms of the Preferred Stock and any series thereof.  

 (d) Except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or to a Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation that alters or changes the powers, preferences, rights or other terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other series of Preferred Stock, to vote thereon pursuant to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or a Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation or pursuant to the DGCL as currently in effect or as the same may hereafter be amended.  

 Section 4\. Voting in Election of Directors. Except as may be required by law or as provided in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or in a Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation, holders of Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and for all other purposes, and holders of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any matter or receive notice of any meeting of stockholders.  

 Section 5\. Ownership of Capital Stock. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the person in whose name any share of its stock is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to, or interest in, such share on the part of any other person, whether or not the Corporation shall have notice thereof, except as expressly provided by applicable law.  

ARTICLE V   

BOARD OF DIRECTORS; MANAGEMENT OF THE CORPORATION   

 Section 1\. Classified Board. The authorized number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors shall be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors, provided that such number shall not be less than three. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to the provisions of a Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (which directors shall not be classified pursuant to this sentence (unless so provided in the Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation)), the directors of the Corporation shall be classified with respect to the   ##### 

  

time for which they severally hold office into three classes, as nearly equal
in number as possible: one class ("Class I"), the initial term of which shall
expire at the first annual meeting of stockholders following the Effective
Time; a second class ("Class II"), the initial term of which shall expire at
the second annual meeting of stockholders following the Effective Time; and a
third class ("Class III"), the initial term of which shall expire at the
third annual meeting of stockholders following the Effective Time, with each
class to hold office until its successors are elected and qualified. At each
annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the successors of
the members of the class of directors whose term expires at that meeting
shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the third succeeding
annual meeting of stockholders. The holders of a majority of shares then
entitled to vote at an election of directors may remove any director or the
entire Board of Directors, but only for cause.  

 Section 2\. Management of Business. The following provisions are inserted for the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation and for the purpose of creating, defining, limiting and regulating the powers of the Corporation and its directors and stockholders:  

      | (a)  |   | Except as may otherwise be provided in a Preferred
Stock Certificate of Designation with respect to vacancies or newly created
directorships in respect of directors, if any, elected by the holders of one
or more series of Preferred Stock, vacancies in the Board of Directors
resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from
office or other cause and newly created directorships resulting from any
increase in the authorized number of directors shall only be filled by
a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or
by a sole remaining director.  
---|---|---|--- 
     
     | (b)  |   | Advance notice of nominations for the election of
directors shall be given in the manner and to the extent provided in the By-
Laws of the Corporation.  
     
     | (c)  |   | The election of directors may be conducted in any
manner approved by the Board of Directors at the time when the election is
held and need not be by written ballot.  
     
     | (d)  |   | The Board of Directors shall have the power without
the assent or vote of the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the
By-Laws of the Corporation. The stockholders of the Corporation may adopt,
amend, alter or repeal any provision of the By-Laws but only upon
the affirmative vote of the holders of three-fourths (3/4) or more of the
combined voting power of the then outstanding  ##### 

  

      |   |   | stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally
in the election of directors.  
---|---|---|--- 
     
     | (e)  |   | There shall be no limitation on the qualification of
any person to be elected as or to be a director of the Corporation or on the
ability of any director to vote on any matter brought before the Board of
Directors or any committee thereof, except (i) as required by applicable
law, (ii) as set forth in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or (iii)
as set forth in any By-Law adopted by the Board of Directors with respect
to eligibility for election as a director upon reaching a specified age or,
in the case of employee directors, with respect to the qualification for
continuing service of directors upon ceasing employment with the
Corporation.  
  

ARTICLE VI   

LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS   

 Section 1\. General. No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of his or her fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent that such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as currently in effect or as the same may hereafter be amended.  

 Section 2\. Indemnification. The Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to the directors of the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable provisions of the DGCL, as now or hereafter in effect, provided that, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.05 of the By-Laws of the Corporation, the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify or advance expenses to a director of the Corporation in respect of an action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) instituted by such director, unless such action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) has been authorized by the Board of Directors. The rights provided by this Article VI, Section 2 shall not limit or exclude any rights, indemnities or limitations of liability to which any director of the Corporation may be entitled, whether as a matter of law, under the By-Laws of the Corporation, by agreement, vote of the stockholders or disinterested directors of the Corporation, or otherwise.  

 Section 3\. Repeal or Modification. Any repeal or modification of this Article VI shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification. If the DGCL is amended after the filing of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal   ##### 

  

liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation
shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL,
as so amended.  

ARTICLE VII   

NO STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT; SPECIAL MEETINGS   

 Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, and the ability of the stockholders to consent in writing to the taking of any action is specifically denied. A special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation may be called only by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, and any right of the stockholders of the Corporation to call a special meeting of the stockholders is specifically denied.  

ARTICLE VIII   

AMENDMENT   

 The Corporation reserves the right to amend or repeal any provision contained in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by the laws of the State of Delaware, and all rights herein conferred upon stockholders or directors (in the present form of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or as hereinafter amended) are granted subject to this reservation; provided, however, that Articles V, VI, VII or VIII of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall not be amended, altered or repealed without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least three-fourths (3/4) of the combined voting power of the then outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.

ARTICLE I   

STOCKHOLDERS   

 Section 1.01. Annual Meetings. The annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation for the election of directors and for the transaction of such other business as properly may come before such meeting shall be held at such place, either within or without the State of Delaware, or, within the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, by means of remote communication, and at such date and at such time, as may be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors and set forth in the notice or waiver of notice of the meeting.  

 Section 1.02. Special Meetings. A special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation may be called only by or at the direction of the Board of Directors. Such special meetings of the stockholders shall be held at such place, within or without the State of Delaware, or, within the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, by means of remote communication, as shall be specified in the respective notices or waivers of notice thereof. Any right of the stockholders of the Corporation to call a special meeting of the stockholders is specifically denied.  

 Section 1.03. Notice of Meetings; Waiver.  

 (a) The Secretary of the Corporation or any Assistant Secretary shall cause notice of the place, if any, date and hour of each meeting of the stockholders, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which such meeting is called, and the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, to be given personally or by mail or by electronic transmission, not fewer than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the meeting, to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If such notice is mailed, it shall be deemed to have been given personally to a stockholder when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his or her address as it appears on the record of stockholders of the Corporation, or, if a stockholder shall have filed with the Secretary of the Corporation a written request that notices to such stockholder be mailed to some other address, then directed to such    ##### 

  

stockholder at such other address. Such further notice shall be given as may
be required by law.  

 (b) A waiver of any notice of any annual or special meeting signed by the person entitled thereto, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any annual or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in a waiver of notice. Attendance of a stockholder at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  

 Section 1.04. Quorum. Except as otherwise required by law or by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of record of one-third (1/3) of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at such meeting.  

 Section 1.05. Voting. At all meetings of stockholders for the election of directors, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. All other elections and questions shall, unless otherwise provided by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, these By-Laws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, applicable law or any regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of stock of the Corporation which are present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon.  

 Section 1.06. Voting by Ballot. No vote of the stockholders on an election of directors need be taken by written ballot or by electronic transmission unless otherwise required by law. Any vote not required to be taken by ballot or by electronic transmission may be conducted in any manner approved by the Board of Directors.  

 Section 1.07. Adjournment. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may be adjourned from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, time or date, by the chairman of the meeting or by the stockholders present in person or by proxy. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the stockholders, the chairman of the meeting or stockholders present in person or by proxy shall have the power to adjourn any such meeting from time to time until a quorum is present. Notice of any adjourned meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation need not be given if the place, if any, date and hour thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, provided, however, that if the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date for the adjourned meeting is fixed pursuant to Section 5.05 of these By-Laws, a notice of the adjourned meeting, conforming to the  ##### 

   

requirements of Section 1.03 hereof, shall be given to each stockholder of
record entitled to vote at such meeting. At any adjourned meeting at which a
quorum is present, any business may be transacted that might have been
transacted on the original date of the meeting.  

 Section 1.08. Proxies. Any stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders may authorize another person or persons to vote at any such meeting and express such consent or dissent for him or her by proxy. A stockholder may authorize a valid proxy by executing a written instrument signed by such stockholder, or by causing his or her signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature, or by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission to the person designated as the holder of the proxy, a proxy solicitation firm or a like authorized agent. No such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after the expiration of three (3) years from the date of such proxy, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the stockholder executing it, except in those cases where the proxy states that it is irrevocable and the proxy is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing with the Secretary of the Corporation either an instrument revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date. Proxies by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of a writing or transmission created pursuant to this section may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.  

 Section 1.09. Conduct of Meetings. The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at the meeting by the chairman of the meeting. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and to adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those  ##### 

   

present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting
to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and
constituted proxies or such other persons as the chairman of the
meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the
time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on the time
allotted to questions or comments by participants. The chairman of any
meeting of stockholders, in addition to making any other determinations that
may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall, if the facts
warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter or business was
not properly brought before the meeting and if such presiding officer should
so determine, such person shall so declare to the meeting and any such matter
or business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted
or considered. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors
or the chairman of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be
required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary
procedure.  

 Section 1.10. Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations.  

 (a) Annual Meetings of Stockholders.  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (i) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of
Directors of the Corporation and the proposal of business to be considered by
the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders
(A) pursuant to the Corporations notice of the meeting (or any
supplement thereto), (B) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or
the Chairman of the Board, or (C) by any stockholder of the Corporation
who is entitled to vote at the meeting, who complies with the
notice procedures set forth in clauses (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph and
who was a stockholder of record at the time such notice is delivered to
the Secretary of the Corporation.  
     
     | (ii) For nominations or other business to be properly brought
before an annual meeting by a stockholder, pursuant to clause (C) of
paragraph (a)(i) of this Section 1.10, the stockholder must have given
timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To
be timely, a stockholders notice shall be delivered to the Secretary of the
Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not fewer
than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to
the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting (which
anniversary date, in the case of the first annual meeting of stockholders
following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated as of March 25, 2003, among Riverwood Holding, Inc.,
Riverwood Acquisition Sub LLC and Graphic Packaging International Corporation
(the "Merger"), shall be deemed to be May 15, 2003) and in any event at least
forty-five (45) days prior to the first anniversary of the date on which
the Corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the preceding
years annual meeting of stockholders (which anniversary date of such
mailing, as  ##### 

     

      |   
---|--- 
     | it relates to the first annual meeting of stockholders following
the closing of the Merger, shall be deemed to be April 15, 2003);
provided that if the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than
thirty (30) days or delayed by more than seventy (70) days from such
anniversary date of the preceding years annual meeting, notice by the
stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than one hundred
twenty (120) days prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close
of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such
annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which
public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. In no
event shall the adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period
for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above.
Such stockholders notice shall set forth (A) as to each person whom
the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a
director all information relating to such person that is required to be
disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is
otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and Rule
14a-11 thereunder, or any successor provisions, including such persons
written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to
serving as a director if elected; (B) as to any other business that
the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description
of the business desired to be brought before the meeting (including the
text of any resolution proposed for consideration), the reasons for
conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such
business of such stockholder and of any beneficial owner on whose behalf
the proposal is made; and (C) as to the stockholder giving the notice and
any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made
(1) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on
the Corporations books, and of such beneficial owner, (2) the class
and number of shares of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and
of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, (3)
a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of
the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear
in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or
nomination, and (4) a representation whether the stockholder or the
beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends (a)
to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least
the percentage of the Corporations outstanding capital stock required
to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (b)
otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal
or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed
satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of
his or her intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in
compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) promulgated under the
Exchange Act and such stockholders proposal has been included in a
proxy statement that has been prepared by the Corporation to solicit
proxies for such annual meeting. The Corporation may require any
proposed nominee to furnish  ##### 

     

      |   
---|--- 
     | such other information as it may reasonably require to determine
the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the
Corporation.  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (iii) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of
paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 1.10 to the contrary, in the event that
the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of
the Corporation is increased and there is no public announcement naming
all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the
increased Board of Directors made by the Corporation at least one hundred
(100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years
annual meeting (which anniversary date, in the case of the first annual
meeting of stockholders following the closing of the Merger, shall be deemed
to be May 15, 2003), a stockholders notice under this paragraph shall
also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any
new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to
the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of
the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth
day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by
the Corporation.  
  

 (b) Special Meetings of Stockholders. Only such business as shall have been brought before the special meeting of the stockholders pursuant to the Corporations notice of meeting pursuant to Section 1.03 of these By-Laws shall be conducted at such meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporations notice of meeting (1) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (2) by any stockholder of the Corporation who is entitled to vote at the meeting, who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 1.10 and who is a stockholder of record at the time such notice is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation. Nominations by stockholders of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at such special meeting of stockholders if the stockholders notice as required by paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 1.10 shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the one hundred and twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the adjournment of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above.  

 (c) General.  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (i) Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 1.10 shall be eligible to be elected
as directors and only such  ##### 

     

      |   
---|--- 
     | business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall
have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this Section 1.10. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the Chairman of the meeting
shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any
business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.10 and, if any
proposed nomination or business is not made or proposed in compliance with
this Section 1.10 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if
any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part
of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be,
proxies in support of such stockholders nominee or proposal in compliance
with such stockholders representation as required by clause (a)(ii)(C)(4)
of this Section 1.10), to declare that such defective proposal or
nomination shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision of
this Section 1.10, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of
the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting
of stockholders of the Corporation to present a nomination or business,
such proposed nomination or business shall be disregarded,
notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received
by the Corporation.  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (ii) For purposes of this Section 1.10, the term
"public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by
the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national
news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with
the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14, or
15(d) of the Exchange Act.  
     
     | (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
1.10, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to
the matters set forth in this Section 1.10. Nothing in this Section
1.10 shall be deemed to affect any rights (A) of stockholders to
request inclusion of proposals in the Corporations proxy statement pursuant
to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, or (B) of the holders of any series of
Preferred Stock, if any, to elect directors if so provided under any
applicable Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (as defined in the
Restated Certificate of Incorporation).  
  

 Section 1.11. Inspectors of Elections. Preceding any meeting of the stockholders, the Board of Directors shall appoint one (1) or more persons to act as Inspectors of Elections, and may designate one (1) or more alternate inspectors. In the event no inspector or alternate is able to act, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one (1) or more inspectors to act at the meeting. No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of the duties of an inspector, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to  ##### 

   

execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the
best of his or her ability. The inspector shall:  

 (a) ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each;  

 (b) determine the shares represented at a meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots;  

 (c) specify the information relied upon to determine the validity of electronic transmissions in accordance with Section 1.08 hereof;  

 (d) count all votes and ballots;  

 (e) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors;  

 (f) certify his or her determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting, and his or her count of all votes and ballots;  

 (g) appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist in the performance of the duties of inspector; and  

 (h) when determining the shares represented and the validity of proxies and ballots, be limited to an examination of the proxies, any envelopes submitted with those proxies, any information provided in accordance with Section 1.08 of these By-Laws, ballots and the regular books and records of the Corporation. The inspector may consider other reliable information for the limited purpose of reconciling proxies and ballots submitted by or on behalf of banks, brokers or their nominees or a similar person which represent more votes than the holder of a proxy is authorized by the record owner to cast or more votes than the stockholder holds of record. If the inspector considers other reliable information as outlined in this section, the inspector, at the time of his or her certification pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, shall specify the precise information considered, the person or persons from whom the information was obtained, when this information was obtained, the means by which the information was obtained, and the basis for the inspectors belief that such information is accurate and reliable.  

 Section 1.12. Opening and Closing of Polls. The date and time for the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter to be voted upon at a stockholder meeting shall be announced at the meeting. The inspector shall be prohibited from accepting any ballots, proxies or votes or any revocations thereof or changes thereto after the closing of the polls, unless the Delaware Court of Chancery upon application by a stockholder shall determine otherwise.   ##### 

 

 Section 1.13. No Stockholder Action by Written Consent. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, and the ability of the stockholders to consent in writing to the taking of any action is specifically denied.  

ARTICLE II   

BOARD OF DIRECTORS   

 Section 2.01. General Powers. Except as may otherwise be provided by law, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the property, affairs and business of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors may exercise all the powers of the Corporation.  

 Section 2.02. Number of Directors. The authorized number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors shall be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors, provided that such number shall not be less than three (3).  

 Section 2.03. Classified Board of Directors; Election of Directors. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to the provisions of a Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (which directors shall not be classified pursuant to this sentence (unless so provided in the Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation)), the directors of the Corporation shall be classified with respect to the time for which they severally hold office into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible: one class ("Class I"), the initial term of which shall expire at the first annual meeting of stockholders following the time of effectiveness of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Effective Time"); a second class ("Class II"), the initial term of which shall expire at the second annual meeting of stockholders following the Effective Time; and a third class ("Class III"), the initial term of which shall expire at the third annual meeting of stockholders following the Effective Time, with each class to hold office until its successors are elected and qualified. At each annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the successors of the members of the class of directors whose term expires at that meeting shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders. The holders of a majority of shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors may remove any director or the entire Board of Directors, but only for cause.  

 Section 2.04. Executive Chairman of the Board. The directors shall elect from among the members of the Board of Directors a Chairman of the Board (the "Executive Chairman"). The Executive Chairman shall be deemed an officer of the Corporation and shall have such duties and powers as set forth in these By-Laws or as shall otherwise be conferred upon the Executive Chairman from time to time by the Board of Directors.   ##### 

 

The Executive Chairman shall, if present, preside over all meetings of the
stockholders of the Corporation and of the Board of Directors. The Board of
Directors shall by resolution establish a procedure to provide for an acting
Executive Chairman in the event the current Executive Chairman is unable to
serve or act in that capacity.  

 Section 2.05. Annual and Regular Meetings. The annual meeting of the Board of Directors for the purpose of electing officers and for the transaction of such other business as may come before the meeting shall be held as soon as reasonably practicable following adjournment of the annual meeting of the stockholders at the place of such annual meeting of the stockholders. Notice of such annual meeting of the Board of Directors need not be given. The Board of Directors from time to time may by resolution provide for the holding of regular meetings and fix the place (which may be within or without the State of Delaware) and the date and hour of such meetings. Notice of regular meetings need not be given; provided, however, that if the Board of Directors shall fix or change the time or place of any regular meeting, notice of such action shall be mailed promptly, or sent by telephone, including a voice messaging system or other system or technology designed to record and communicate messages, telegraph, facsimile, electronic mail or other electronic means, to each director who shall not have been present at the meeting at which such action was taken, addressed to him or her at his or her usual place of business, or shall be delivered to him or her personally. Notice of such action need not be given to any director who submits a waiver of notice, whether before or after such meeting.  

 Section 2.06. Special Meetings; Notice. Special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held whenever called by the Executive Chairman or the President and Chief Executive Officer, at such place (within or without the State of Delaware), date and hour as may be specified in the respective notices or waivers of notice of such meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors also may be held whenever called pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the entire Board of Directors.

 Section 5.01. Certificates of Stock, Uncertificated Shares. The shares of the Corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of the stock of the Corporation shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until each such certificate is surrendered to the Corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the Board of Directors, every holder of stock in the Corporation represented by certificates and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of, the Corporation, by the Executive Chairman or the President and Chief Executive Officer, and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary of the Corporation or an Assistant Secretary, representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Such certificate shall be in such form as the Board of Directors may determine, to the extent consistent with applicable law, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and these By-Laws.   ##### 

 

 Section 5.02. Signatures; Facsimile. All signatures on the certificate referred to in Section 5.01 of these By-Laws may be in facsimile, engraved or printed form, to the extent permitted by law. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed, or whose facsimile, engraved or printed signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.  

 Section 5.03. Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. The Board of Directors may direct that a new certificate be issued in place of any certificate theretofore issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon delivery to the Corporation of an affidavit of the owner or owners of such certificate, setting forth such allegation. The Corporation may require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his or her legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of any such new certificate.  

 Section 5.04. Transfer of Stock. Upon surrender to the Corporation or the transfer agent of the Corporation of a certificate for shares, duly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, the Corporation shall, subject to any applicable restrictions on transfer conspicuously noted thereon, issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books. Within a reasonable time after the transfer of uncertificated stock, the Corporation shall send to the registered owner thereof a written notice containing the information required to be set forth or stated on certificates pursuant to the laws of the DGCL. Subject to the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and these By-Laws, the Board of Directors may prescribe such additional rules and regulations as it may deem appropriate relating to the issue, transfer and registration of shares of the Corporation.  

 Section 5.05. Record Date.

A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting, provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.  

 In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights of the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or  ##### 

   

exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board
of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which
record date shall be not more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If
no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any
such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board
of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.  

 Section 5.06. Registered Stockholders. Prior to due surrender of a certificate for registration of transfer, the Corporation may treat the registered owner as the person exclusively entitled to receive dividends and other distributions, to vote, to receive notice and otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers of the owner of the shares represented by such certificate, and the Corporation shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or legal claim to or interest in such shares on the part of any other person, whether or not the Corporation shall have notice of such claim or interests. Whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for collateral security, and not absolutely, it shall be so expressed in the entry of the transfer if, when the certificates are presented to the Corporation for transfer or uncertificated shares are requested to be transferred, both the transferor and transferee request the Corporation to do so.

INDEMNIFICATION   

 Section 6.01. Nature of Indemnity. The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (a "Proceeding"), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was or has agreed to become a director, officer or employee of the Corporation, or while a director, officer or employee of the Corporation is or was serving or has agreed to serve at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, and may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to such a Proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she is or was or has agreed to become an agent of the Corporation, or while an agent of the Corporation is or was serving or has agreed to serve at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees),  ##### 

   

judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in connection with such
Proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he or she acted in good faith and in
a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal Proceeding,
had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful; provided
that in the case of a Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to
procure a judgment in its favor, (a) such indemnification shall be limited to
expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such
person in the defense or settlement of such Proceeding, and (b) no
indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to
which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation
unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or the
court in which such Proceeding was brought shall determine upon application
that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all
the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled
to indemnity for such expenses which the Delaware Court of Chancery or such
other court shall deem proper. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to
Section 6.05 of these By-Laws, the Corporation shall not be obligated to
indemnify a director, officer or employee of the Corporation in respect of a
Proceeding (or part thereof) instituted by such person, unless such
Proceeding (or part thereof) has been authorized by the Board of
Directors.  

 The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.  

 Section 6.02. Successful Defense. To the extent that a present or former director, officer or employee of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding referred to in Section 6.01 hereof or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.  

 Section 6.03. Determination that Indemnification is Proper. Any indemnification of a present or former director, officer or employee of the Corporation under Section 6.01 hereof (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director, officer or employee is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.01 hereof. Any indemnification of a present or former agent of the Corporation under Section 6.01 hereof (unless ordered by a court) may be made by the Corporation upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.01 hereof. Any such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who  ##### 

   

is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (a) by a majority
vote of the directors who are not parties to such Proceeding, even though
less than a quorum, (b) by a committee of such directors designated by
majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, (c) if there
are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal
counsel in a written opinion, or (d) by the stockholders of the
Corporation.  

 Section 6.04. Advance Payment of Expenses. Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by a current or former director or officer in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative Proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article. Such expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Corporation deems appropriate. The Board of Directors may authorize the Corporations counsel to represent such director, officer, employee or agent in any Proceeding, whether or not the Corporation is a party to such Proceeding.  

 Section 6.05. Procedure for Indemnification. Any indemnification of a director, officer or employee under Sections 6.01 and 6.02, or advance of costs, charges and expenses to a director or officer under Section 6.04 of these By-Laws, shall be made promptly, and in any event within thirty (30) days, upon the written request of such person. If the Corporation denies a written request for indemnity or advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full pursuant to such request is not made within thirty (30) days, the right to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article VI shall be enforceable by the director, officer or employee in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such persons costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or her right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such Proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a defense to any such Proceeding (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advancement of costs, charges and expenses under Section 6.04 of these By-Laws where the required undertaking, if any, has been received by the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.01 of these By-Laws, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its disinterested directors, its independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.01 of these By-Laws, nor the fact that there has been an actual determination by the Corporation (including its disinterested directors, its independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.   ##### 

 

 Section 6.06. Survival; Preservation of Other Rights. The foregoing indemnification provisions shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each director, officer and employee who serves in any such capacity at any time while these provisions as well as the relevant provisions of the DGCL are in effect and any repeal or modification thereof shall not affect any right or obligation then existing with respect to any state of facts then or previously existing or any Proceeding previously or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts. Such a "contract right" may not be modified retroactively without the consent of such director, officer or employee.  

 The indemnification provided by this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such persons official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer or employee and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.  

 Section 6.07. Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was or has agreed to become a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person or on such persons behalf in any such capacity, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of this Article VI.  

 Section 6.08. Severability. If this Article VI or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director, officer or employee and may indemnify each agent of the Corporation as to costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to a Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including a Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article VI that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.   #####

Ladies and Gentlemen:  

 The undersigned is a holder of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Graphic Packaging International Corporation, a Colorado corporation ("Graphic Packaging"), and is entitled to receive in connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 25, 2003 (the "Merger Agreement"), among Riverwood Holding, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Riverwood"), Riverwood Acquisition Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Riverwood ("Merger Sub"), and Graphic Packaging, and the transactions contemplated thereby (the "Merger Transactions"), common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Riverwood ("Riverwood Common Stock").  

 The undersigned has been advised that as of the date of this letter the undersigned may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Graphic Packaging, as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act").  

 1. The undersigned hereby represents, warrants and covenants to Riverwood that in the event the undersigned receives any Riverwood Common Stock as a result of the Merger Transactions:  

      |   
---|--- 
     | a. The undersigned shall not make any offer, sale, pledge,
transfer or other disposition of shares of Riverwood Common Stock in
violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | b. The undersigned has carefully read this letter and the
Merger Agreement and discussed the requirements of such documents and
other applicable limitations upon the undersigneds ability to sell, transfer
or otherwise dispose of Riverwood Common Stock, to the extent the
undersigned felt necessary, with the undersigneds counsel or counsel for
Graphic Packaging.  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | c. The undersigned has been advised that the issuance of
Riverwood Common Stock to the undersigned pursuant to the Merger Transactions
has been registered with the Commission under the Act on a
Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, the undersigned has also been
advised that, because at the time the Merger Transactions are submitted for a
vote of the stockholders of Graphic   ##### 

   

      |   
---|--- 
     | Packaging, (i) the undersigned may be deemed to be an affiliate of
Graphic Packaging and (ii) the distribution by the undersigned of Riverwood
Common Stock has not been registered under the Act, the undersigned may not
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares of Riverwood Common Stock
issued to the undersigned in the Merger Transactions unless (A) such sale,
transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other
limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act, (B) such
sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act or (C)
in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Riverwood, or pursuant to
a "no action" letter obtained by the undersigned from the staff of the
Commission, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from
registration under the Act.  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | d. The undersigned understands that Riverwood is under no
obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of Riverwood
Common Stock by the undersigned or on the undersigneds behalf under the
Act except, if the undersigned is a party thereto, as provided in the
Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement dated as of March 25, 2003
or, except as provided in paragraph 2(a) below, to take any other
action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from
such registration available.  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | e. The undersigned also understands that stop transfer
instructions will be given to Riverwoods transfer agent with respect to
Riverwood Common Stock issued to the undersigned in the Merger Transactions,
and there will be placed on the respective certificates for such
Riverwood Common Stock a legend stating in substance:  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN
A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"), APPLIES, AND MAY BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED
OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF ONLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LIMITATIONS OF
SUCH RULE 145, OR UPON RECEIPT BY RIVERWOOD HOLDING, INC. OF AN OPINION
OF COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO IT THAT SOME OTHER EXEMPTION
FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT IS AVAILABLE, OR PURSUANT TO A
REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE ACT."  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | f. The undersigned also understands that unless a sale or
transfer is made in conformity with the provisions of any of paragraphs
1(c)(ii)(A) or (B) hereof, Riverwood reserves the right to put the following
legends, as applicable, on the certificates issued to the undersigneds
transferee with respect to Riverwood Common Stock:  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT
BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND WERE ACQUIRED FROM
A PERSON WHO RECEIVED SUCH SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE
145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE   ##### 

   

      |   
---|--- 
     | SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY
THE HOLDER NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY
DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY
NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN
EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF
1933."  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | g. Execution of this letter shall not be considered an
admission on the undersigneds part that the undersigned is an "affiliate" of
Graphic Packaging as described in the first paragraph of this letter, nor as
a waiver of any rights the undersigned may have to object to any claim
that the undersigned is such an affiliate.  
  

 2. By Riverwoods acceptance of this letter Riverwood hereby agrees with the undersigned as follows:  

      |   
---|--- 
     | a. For so long as and to the extent necessary to permit
the undersigned to sell the shares of Riverwood Common Stock pursuant to
Rule 145 and, to the extent applicable, Rule 144 under the Act, Riverwood

upon request a written statement as to whether Riverwood has filed, on a
timely basis, all reports and data required to be filed with the Commission
by it pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), during the 12 months preceding any proposed
sale of the shares of Riverwood Common Stock by the undersigned under Rule
145.  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | b. It is understood and agreed that certificates with the
legends set forth in paragraphs 1(e) and (f) above will, after surrender of
such certificates, be substituted by delivery of certificates without
such legends if (i) one year shall have elapsed from the date the
undersigned acquired the Riverwood Common Stock, received in the Merger
Transactions and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) are then available to the
undersigned, (ii) two years shall have elapsed from the date the undersigned
acquired the Riverwood Common Stock, received in the Merger Transactions and
the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are then applicable to the undersigned,
or (iii) Riverwood has received either an opinion of counsel, which
opinion and counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Riverwood, or a "no-
action" letter obtained by the undersigned from the staff of the Commission,
to the effect that the restrictions imposed by Rule 144 and Rule 145 under
the Act no longer apply to the undersigned; provided that, if the undersigned
is a party to the Stockholders Agreement, dated as of March 25, 2003
(the "Stockholders Agreement"), legends will continue to be placed on such
certificates in accordance with the terms of the Stockholders Agreement.  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | 3\. This letter shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to
its principles or rules of conflicts of laws to the extent such principles or
rules would require the application of the law of another jurisdiction.  #####
