Corporation shall have authority to issue is 550,000,000 shares, consisting of
(a)&nbsp;500,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the &#147;Common
Stock&#148;), and (b)&nbsp;50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per
share (the &#147;Preferred Stock&#148;), issuable in one or more series as hereinafter
provided. The number of authorized shares of the Common Stock or Preferred
Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof
then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors irrespective of the provisions of Section&nbsp;242(b)(2) of

into and become 15.21 shares of Common Stock and (ii)&nbsp;each share of Class&nbsp;B
Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Corporation which immediately
prior to the Effective Time was outstanding or held as treasury stock shall be

of Common Stock shall be issued upon the Reclassification. If any fraction of
a share of Common Stock would otherwise be issuable upon the Reclassification,
the Corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional shares of Common
Stock, pay to each stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fractional share an amount in cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the
fair market value per share of the Common Stock, as determined by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation, computed to the nearest whole cent.

the Corporation for the election of directors and for the transaction of such
other business as properly may come before such meeting shall be held at such
place, either within or without the State of Delaware, or, within the sole
discretion of the Board of Directors, by means of remote communication, and at
such date and at such time, as may be fixed from time to time by resolution of
the Board of Directors and set forth in the notice or waiver of notice of the

the Corporation may be called only by or at the direction of the Board of
Directors. Such special meetings of the stockholders shall be held at such

person entitled thereto, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person
entitled to notice, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Neither the business
to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any annual or special meeting of the
stockholders need be specified in a waiver of notice. Attendance of a
stockholder at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a waiver of notice of
such meeting, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express
purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of
any business on the ground that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the presence in person or by proxy of
the holders of record of one-third (1/3) of the voting power of the shares
entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business at such meeting.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1.05. Voting. At all meetings of stockholders for the election of
directors, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. All
other elections and questions shall, unless otherwise provided by the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, these By-Laws, the rules or regulations of any
stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, applicable law or any regulation
applicable to the Corporation or its securities, be decided by the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of stock of the
Corporation which are present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote
thereon.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1.06. Voting by Ballot. No vote of the stockholders on an
election of directors need be taken by written ballot or by electronic
transmission unless otherwise required by law. Any vote not required to be
taken by ballot or by electronic transmission may be conducted in any manner
approved by the Board of Directors.

special, may be adjourned from time to time to reconvene at the same or some
other place, time or date, by the chairman of the meeting or by the
stockholders present in person or by proxy. If a quorum is not present at any
meeting of the stockholders, the chairman of the meeting or stockholders
present in person or by proxy shall have the power to adjourn any such meeting
from time to time until a quorum is present. Notice of any adjourned meeting
of the stockholders of the Corporation need not be given if the place, if any,
date and hour thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken, provided, however, that if the adjournment is for more than thirty (30)
days, or if after the adjournment a new record date for the adjourned meeting
is fixed pursuant to Section&nbsp;5.05 of these By-Laws, a notice of the adjourned

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1.08. Proxies. Any stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of
the stockholders may authorize another person or persons to vote at any such
meeting and express such consent or dissent for him or her by proxy. A
stockholder may authorize a valid proxy by executing a written instrument
signed by such stockholder, or by causing his or her signature to be affixed to
such writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by
facsimile signature, or by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a
telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission to the person
designated as the holder of the proxy, a proxy solicitation firm or a like
authorized agent. No such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after the
expiration of three (3)&nbsp;years from the date of such proxy, unless such proxy
provides for a longer period. Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of
the stockholder executing it, except in those cases where the proxy states that
it is irrevocable and the proxy is coupled with an interest sufficient in law
to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is
not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing with
the Secretary of the Corporation either an instrument revoking the proxy or
another duly executed proxy bearing a later date. Proxies by telegram,
cablegram or other electronic transmission must either set forth or be
submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram,
cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder.
Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of a
writing or transmission created pursuant to this section may be substituted or
used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes
for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that
such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a
complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.

the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote
at a meeting
shall be announced at the meeting by the chairman of the meeting. The
Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the
conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to
the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board
of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall have the right
and authority to convene and to adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules,
regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such
chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules,
regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or

application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the
circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such expenses which the Delaware Court of Chancery or such other
court shall deem proper. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to Section

the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay

entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article.
Such expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) incurred by other employees and

costs, charges and expenses to a director or officer under Section&nbsp;6.04 of
these By-Laws, shall be made promptly, and in any event within thirty (30)
days, upon the written request of such person. If the Corporation denies a
written request for indemnity or advancement of expenses, in whole or in part,
or if payment in full pursuant to such request is not made within thirty (30)
days, the right to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article&nbsp;VI
shall be enforceable by the director, officer or employee in any court of
competent jurisdiction. Such person&#146;s costs and expenses incurred in
connection with successfully establishing his or her right to indemnification,
in whole or in part, in any such Proceeding shall also be indemnified by the
Corporation. It shall be a defense to any such Proceeding (other than an
action brought to enforce a claim for the advancement of costs, charges and
expenses under Section&nbsp;6.04 of these By-Laws where the required undertaking, if
any, has been received by the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the
standard of conduct set forth in Section&nbsp;6.01 of these By-Laws, but the burden
of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of
the Corporation
(including its disinterested directors, its independent legal counsel, or
its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of
such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances
because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
Section&nbsp;6.01 of these By-Laws, nor the fact that there has been an actual
determination by the Corporation (including its disinterested directors, its
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create
a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise

indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of this

the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director, officer or employee

expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement with respect to a Proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, including a Proceeding by or in the right of
the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of
