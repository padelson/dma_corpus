material respects (subject to the absence of notes thereto and year-end audit
adjustments). The AM Business Financial Statements are qualified by the fact
that the AM Business has not been operated as a separate "stand-alone"
business by the Seller and the Affiliates of the Seller. As a result, the AM
Business receives certain allocated charges and credits with respect to
charges and expenses shared with other business of the Seller as discussed
more fully in the notes accompanying the AM Business Financial Statements.
Such allocated charges and credits do not necessarily reflect the amounts
which would have resulted from arms-length transactions, but have been
estimated in good faith by the Seller.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) The Seller Parties have devised and maintained systems of internal
accounting and controls with respect to the AM Business reasonably believed to
provide assurances that, in all material respects, (i) all transactions are
executed in accordance with managements general or specific authorization,
(ii) all transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of
financial statements in conformity with Japanese GAAP and to maintain proper
accountability for items, (iii) access to its property and assets is permitted
only in accordance with managements general or specific authorization and
(iv) the recorded accountability for items is compared with actual levels at
reasonable intervals and appropriate actions are taken with respect to any
differences.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BUYER

 



 

The Buyer represents and warrants as of the Effective Date and as of the
Closing Date (except as provided in the Buyers Closing Date Bringdown
Certificate), except to the extent that a representation, warranty or Buyer
Disclosure Schedule expressly states that such representation or warranty, or
the information in such Buyer Disclosure Schedule, is accurate only as of a
specific date, to the Seller as follows:

 



 

Section 4.01 _Corporate Existence and Power_. Each Buyer Party is a legal
entity duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the jurisdiction of its incorporation. Each Buyer Party is duly qualified
to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each other
jurisdiction where the transaction of its business requires such
qualification, except where the lack of such qualification would not
reasonably be expected to prohibit or materially impair the Buyers ability to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or to complete the Transactions
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the other Ancillary
Documents.

 



 

Section 4.02 _Corporate Authorization_. Each of the Buyer and Spansion LLC
has all requisite power, authority and legal right under its organizational

is or will be a party, perform its obligations under this Agreement and any
Ancillary Document to which it is or will be a party and consummate the
transactions contemplated thereby, and each Buyer Party has all requisite
corporate power, authority and legal right under its organizational documents
to enter into any Ancillary Document to which such Buyer Party is or will be a
party, perform its obligations under any Ancillary Document to which such
Buyer Party is or will be a party and consummate the transactions contemplated
thereby. The execution, delivery, and performance by the Buyer and Spansion
LLC of this Agreement and any Ancillary Documents to which it is or will be a
party, and the consummation by the Buyer and Spansion LLC of the Transactions,
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Buyer and Spansion LLC, and the execution, delivery, and performance by each
other Buyer Party of this Agreement and any Ancillary Documents to which it is
or will be a party, and the consummation by each other Buyer Party of the
Transactions, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of such Buyer Party. Assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by each Party (other than the Buyer Parties), this
Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of the Buyer and
Spansion LLC, enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms
and conditions, subject to Applicable Laws of general application relating to
public policy, bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors, Applicable
Laws governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies and general principles of equity. Assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery of each Ancillary Document to which each other Buyer
Party is or will be a party by the other parties thereto, (other than any
Buyer Party), each Ancillary Document to which such Buyer Party is or will be
a party will, when executed by such Buyer Party, constitute a valid and
legally binding agreement of such Buyer Party, enforceable against the Buyer
in accordance with its terms and conditions, subject to Applicable Laws of
general application relating to public policy, bankruptcy, insolvency and the
relief of debtors, Applicable Laws governing specific performance, injunctive
relief and other equitable remedies and general principles of equity. The
Buyer has all requisite corporate power, authority and legal right to cause
the Affiliates of the Buyer that are or will be a party to any Ancillary
Document to perform such Affiliates obligations thereunder and to consummate
the Transactions, including the transactions contemplated by the applicable
Ancillary Document.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 4.03 _Noncontravention_. Neither the execution and delivery by the
Buyer and Spansion LLC of this Agreement, nor the execution and delivery by
any Buyer Party of any Ancillary Document to which any Buyer Party is or will
be a party, nor the consummation by the Buyer Parties of the Transactions,
will (i) violate any provision of the organizational documents of any Buyer
Party, (ii) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without
due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of
termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration) under any of the terms
of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, license, contract, lease, or other
instrument or obligation to which any Buyer Party is a party (or result in the
imposition of any Encumbrance (other than Permitted Encumbrances) upon any
Buyer Partys assets), that would reasonably be likely to prohibit or
materially impair any Buyer Partys ability to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or to complete the Transactions in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the other Ancillary Documents or (iii) violate any
Applicable Law or any Order of any Governmental Body applicable to any Buyer
Party.

 



 

Section 4.04 _Governmental Authorization_. The execution and delivery by the
Buyer and Spansion LLC of this Agreement and the execution and delivery by
each applicable Buyer Party of any Ancillary Documents to which such Buyer
Party is or will be a party, and the consummation by the Buyer Parties of the
Transactions, require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Body or any other Person, other than compliance with any
applicable requirements of any Antitrust Laws and Licenses or Permits
equivalent to those described in Schedule 3.14(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules, and other routine and administrative Licenses or Permits to be
obtained by the Buyer Parties in the Ordinary Course of Business.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 4.05 _Proceedings and Orders_. No Buyer Party is (i) subject to any
outstanding Order, or (ii) party to any pending Proceeding or, to the
Knowledge of the Buyer Parties, Threatened Proceeding, that, in either case,
would reasonably be likely to prohibit or materially impair the Buyers
ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to complete the
Transactions in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the other
Ancillary Documents.

 



 

Section 4.06 _Financing_. Each Buyer Party has available as of the Effective
Date lines of credit or other sources of immediately available funds, and on
the Closing Date shall have immediately available sufficient funds on hand, in
each case to enable such Buyer Party to pay its portion of the Purchase Price
and all Transaction Expenses payable by the Buyer Parties pursuant hereto.

 



 

Section 4.07 _Solvency_. The Buyer is not entering into this Agreement or the
other Ancillary Documents with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud any
Person to which the Buyer is, or may become, indebted. Immediately following
the Closing and after giving effect to the Stock Purchase and the other
Transactions, the Buyer shall not (a) be insolvent (either because its
financial condition is such that the sum of its debts and other liabilities,

value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its probable
liability on its existing debts as they become absolute and mature); (b) have

PRE-CLOSING COVENANTS

 



 

Section 5.01 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 



 

(a) The Parties shall each cooperate with the other and use (and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to use) their respective reasonable best
efforts to promptly (i) take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause
to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective the Transactions as soon as practicable, including preparing and
filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings,
notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents, (ii) obtain all approvals, consents,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations required to be
obtained from any Third Party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Transactions, and (iii) execute and deliver such documents, certificates and
other papers as a Party may reasonably request to evidence the other Partys
satisfaction of its obligations hereunder. Subject to Applicable Laws relating
to the exchange of information and in addition to Section 5.01(e), the Parties
shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable,
each will consult the other on, any information relating to the AM Business,
the Seller and its Affiliates, the Company, FVLSI-Newco, FMSL-Newco or the
Buyer and its Affiliates, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any Third Party and/or any
Governmental Body in connection with the Transactions.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) With respect to any of the Business Contracts that are related both to
the AM Business and to other businesses of the Seller or any of its Affiliates
(each, a " _Shared Contract_ "), upon request by the Buyer the Seller shall
exercise commercially reasonable efforts prior to the Closing to facilitate
the negotiation by the Buyer of a new Contract between the relevant
counterparty and the relevant Buyer Party. The Buyer Parties shall exercise
commercially reasonable efforts to enter into each replacement Contract that
is a condition precedent to Closing (unless such condition precedent is waived
by the Buyer).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, the Buyer shall use
reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain any necessary approval from any
Governmental Body responsible for enforcement of any Antitrust Law, (ii)
prevent the initiation of any Proceeding by any Governmental Body under any
Antitrust Law, or (iii) prevent the entry of any decree, judgment, injunction
preliminary or permanent, or any order that would otherwise make the
Transactions unlawful. Nothing in this Agreement will require the Buyer (or
its Affiliates) to take any action, including entering into any consent
decree, hold separate orders or other arrangements, that requires the
divestiture of any assets of any of the Company, the Buyer or its respective
Affiliates.

 



 

(d) As promptly as possible after the Effective Date, the Parties shall
file all notifications required by any Antitrust Law in the jurisdictions
identified in Schedule 5.01(d) hereto (the " _Antitrust Notifications_ ") with
respect to the Transactions. Each Party shall furnish the other Party with
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other Party may
reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any Antitrust
Notifications. During the term of this Agreement, neither the Seller nor the
Buyer shall withdraw any Antitrust Notification without the written consent of
the other Party or enter into any timing agreement with any Governmental Body
without the written consent of the other Party. The Parties shall furnish
promptly to any requesting Governmental Body any additional information
requested from such Party in connection with such Antitrust Notifications. The
Buyer Parties shall pay all applicable filing fees required in connection with
any Antitrust Notifications filed by a Buyer Party. The Seller Parties shall
pay all applicable filing fees required in connection with any Antitrust
Notifications filed by a Seller Party. The Buyer and the Seller shall equally
share the cost of any jointly filed Antitrust Notifications.

 



 

(e) Subject to Applicable Law and all privileges, including the attorney-
client privilege, the Parties shall cooperate fully with each other in
connection with the making of all Antitrust Notifications or responding to
requests for information from any Governmental Body and will:

 



 

 



   



 

(i) keep the other Parties reasonably informed of any communication
received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, any Governmental Body
regarding the Transactions, and any communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party regarding the Transactions;

 



 

(ii) provide copies of any written communications received from or given
to any Governmental Body unless prohibited by Applicable Law; and

 



 

(iii) permit the other Parties to review and incorporate the other Partys
reasonable comments in any communication given by it to any Governmental Body
or in connection with any proceeding by a private party related to any
Antitrust Laws with any other Person.

 



 

(f) No Party will initiate, or participate in any meeting or discussion
with any Governmental Body with respect to any Antitrust Notifications,
applications, investigation, or other inquiry regarding the Transactions
without giving the other Parties reasonable prior notice of the meeting or
discussion and, to the extent permitted by the relevant Governmental Body, the
opportunity to attend and participate (which, at the reasonable request of any
Party, will be limited to outside antitrust counsel only). Subject to
Applicable Law and all applicable privileges (including the attorney-client
privilege), the Parties shall consult and cooperate with one another in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
Party relating to proceedings under any Antitrust Law. A Party may, as it
deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other Parties as "outside counsel only."
Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient, unless
express written permission is obtained in advance from the source of the
materials.

 



 

(g) If any Proceeding is instituted (or Threatened to be instituted)
challenging the Transactions as violative of any Antitrust Law, or if any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order is entered, enforced or attempted
to be entered or enforced by a court or other Governmental Body, which decree,
judgment, injunction or other order would make the Transactions illegal or
would otherwise prohibit, prevent, restrict, impair or delay consummation of
the Transactions, the Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to contest and
resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any such decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions and to have such
decree, judgment, injunction or other order repealed, rescinded or made
inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the Transactions.

flow and stockholders equity of the AM Business as of and for the twelve (12)
month periods ending March 31, 2013 and March 31, 2012 (the " _Audited
Financial Statements_ "). Within forty (40) days after the Closing (or forty-
five (45) days after the Closing if the Closing does not occur on the 1st day
of a calendar month), the Seller shall prepare and cause its independent
auditor to review financial statements for the AM Business, for the periods
(i) between April 1, 2013 to the Closing Date and (ii) between April 1, 2013
to June 30, 2013 (collectively, the " _Stub Financial Statements_ "). In
addition, following the Closing, if required for the preparation of pro-forma
financial statements that the Buyer is required to file with the SEC for any
purpose, the Seller Parties shall, and shall cause their officers, directors,
employees and representatives to, provide commercially reasonable assistance
to the Buyer in connection with the Buyers preparation of unaudited financial
statements for the AM Business for the applicable period so that the Buyer may
file such pro-forma financial statements as necessary. To the extent required
by the SEC, all such financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with
U.S. GAAP and Regulation S-X of the SEC and in a manner reasonably
satisfactory to the Buyers independent auditors. The Buyer shall bear the
first Six Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars ($600,000) in costs and expenses (and
the Buyer and the Seller shall share equally all additional costs and expenses
above Six Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars ($600,000)) with respect to the
Sellers independent auditor and other audit related third party expenses with
respect to the audit of the Audited Financial Statements and the preparation
of the Stub Financial Statements. Prior to and after the Closing, the Seller
shall request, and take all reasonable steps necessary to encourage, its
auditors to cooperate with the Buyer and provide all necessary consents
required by the SEC and with its preparation of any financial statements or
other reports required by Applicable Law. Promptly following the Effective

reasonable steps necessary to obtain such relief, to provide the Statement of
Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed and Statement of Revenues and Direct
Expenses to satisfy the financial statement requirements of Rule 3-05 of
Regulation S-X (the " _Relief Request_ ") and request that such financial
statements may be prepared according to IFRS standards. Provided approval of
the Relief Request is granted by the SEC, the Statement of Assets Acquired and
Liabilities Assumed and Statement of Revenues and Direct Expenses can be

to be filed by the Newcos or with respect to the Assigned IPR, Transferred
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities (1) for all taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date or (2) that are due on or before the Closing Date
(each such Tax Return, a " _Seller Return_ "). If necessary to permit the
Seller to properly file (or cause to be filed) any Seller Return, the Buyer
shall cause each Seller Return to be executed by an authorized Person on
behalf of the appropriate Newco.

 



 

(ii) The Buyer shall prepare and timely file (or cause to be prepared and
timely filed) with the appropriate Taxing Authorities all Tax Returns (other
than Seller Returns) required to be filed by the Newcos or with respect to the
Assigned IPR, Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities for all taxable
periods beginning on or before the Closing Date that are due after the Closing
Date (each such Tax Return, a " _Buyer Return_ ").

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no liability in
respect of Tax shown on any Buyer Return shall be considered to constitute a
Loss or Indemnified Pre-Closing Tax subject to indemnity pursuant to Section
9.01 unless the Buyer shall have provided the Seller with a copy of such Buyer
Return for review and approval at least thirty (30) days before the filing due
date of such Buyer Return (or, if required to be filed within thirty (30) days
after the Closing Date, as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Closing), accompanied by a statement (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Statement_ ")
setting forth and calculating in reasonable detail the Pre-Closing Taxes and
Indemnified Pre-Closing Taxes that are shown as due on such Tax Return. Each
Pre-Closing Tax Statement shall be treated as the notice required by Section
9.04(a) in respect of any claim for indemnity by any Buyer Indemnified Party
in respect of the Indemnified Taxes shown thereon.

 



 

 



   



 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no liability in
respect of Tax shown on any Seller Return shall be considered to constitute a
Loss or Indemnified Post-Closing Tax subject to indemnity pursuant to Section
9.02 unless the Seller shall have provided the Buyer with a copy of such

(v) If the Seller disagrees with the manner of preparation of a Buyer
Return, or the amount of Pre-Closing Taxes or Indemnified Pre-Closing Taxes
calculated in a Pre-Closing Tax Statement, or if the Buyer disagrees with the
manner of preparation of a Seller Return, or the amount of Post-Closing Taxes
or Indemnified Post-Closing Taxes calculated in a Post-Closing Tax Statement,
within twenty (20) days after receipt of such Buyer Return, Seller Return,
Pre-Closing Tax Statement or Post-Closing Tax Statement, as the case may be,
the disagreeing Party shall provide to the other Party a notice of such
dispute (a " _Tax Statement Dispute_ "), together with a written explanation
of the reasons for its disagreement. If the disagreeing Party does not provide
a notice of Tax Statement Dispute within such twenty-day period, the
disagreeing Party shall be deemed to have accepted the Buyer Return, Seller
Return, Pre-Closing Tax Statement or Post-Closing Tax Statement, as the case
may be, relating thereto for purposes of Article 9\. The Buyer and the Seller
shall work in good faith to resolve their disagreement within ten (10) days
following the disagreeing Partys notification to the other Party of a Tax
Statement Dispute. If the Seller and the Buyer cannot reach complete agreement
within such ten (10) day period, they each shall select a Tax expert from an
accounting firm or law firm knowledgeable in the area of the dispute, and such
experts shall attempt to resolve the differences. Each Party shall be
responsible for the costs and fees of its Tax expert. If the Buyer and the
Seller are unable to resolve their disagreement through their respective Tax
experts within twenty (20) days following the disagreeing Partys notification
to the other Party of the Tax Settlement Dispute, the dispute shall be
submitted to a mutually agreeable arbitrator (the " _Tax Arbitrator_ ") for
resolution within five (5) days of such failure to resolve the disagreement.
The decision of the Tax Arbitrator with respect to such dispute shall be
binding upon the Parties.

 



 

(vi) The Tax Arbitrator shall be required to resolve the matters set forth
in the Tax Statement Dispute upon which the Buyer and the Seller have
disagreed (the " _Disputed Items_ ") in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement. In connection with the resolution of the
Disputed Items by the Tax Arbitrator: (A) within ten (10) days of the Tax
Arbitrator signing an engagement letter, the disagreeing Party shall furnish
or cause to be furnished to the Tax Arbitrator the data, correspondence and
other materials it presented to the other Party pursuant to this Section
6.02(a) (including all settlement offers), together with a statement of the
value that the disagreeing Party assigns to each Disputed Item (with a copy
thereof to the other Party), (B) within five (5) days of receiving materials
identified in this Section 6.02(a)(vi), the other Party shall furnish or cause
to be furnished to the Tax Arbitrator the data, correspondence and other

to the disagreeing Party); (iii) each of the disagreeing Party and the other
Party shall be afforded the opportunity to make a presentation to the Tax
Arbitrator relating to the Disputed Items and to discuss such Disputed Items
with the Tax Arbitrator, in each case in the presence of the other Party; (iv)
no ex parte communications with the Tax Arbitrator shall be permitted; (v) the
determination by the Tax Arbitrator for each Disputed Item shall be equal to
one of the values, or within the range between the values, assigned to such
Disputed Item by the Seller and the Buyer; and (vi) the Parties shall request
that the determination by the Tax Arbitrator be delivered in a written report
to both the Seller and the Buyer within sixty (60) days of the Tax Arbitrator
signing its engagement letter, and such determination shall be final and
binding on the Parties. The engagement letter with the Tax Arbitrator shall
permit the Tax Arbitrator to engage a law firm, mutually acceptable to the
Parties, to assist with the interpretation of terms of this Agreement relevant
to the Disputed Items. The fees and expenses of the Tax Arbitrator shall be
allocated to and paid by each of the Seller and the Buyer based on the
percentage of the portion of the total contested amount not awarded in such
Partys favor bears to the total amount contested by the Seller and the Buyer,
as determined by the Tax Arbitrator.

 



 

 



   



 

(vii) The Buyer Parties and the Seller Parties shall cooperate fully with
the Tax Arbitrator and respond on a timely basis to all requests for
information or access to documents or personnel made by the Tax Arbitrator or
by the other Party, all with the intent to fairly and in good faith resolve
all disputes relating to the Tax Statement Dispute as promptly as reasonably
practicable.

 



 

(b) _Allocation of Taxes_. The Buyer shall not permit any Newco to take
any action after Closing on the Closing Date that is out of the Ordinary
Course of Business, except as required by the express terms of this Agreement,
the other Ancillary Documents, the Inventory Purchase and Sale Agreement, and
the Equipment Tester Transfer Agreement. With respect to any Straddle Period,
Taxes incurred by the Newcos or with respect to the Assigned IPR, Transferred
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing
Tax Period and Post-Closing Tax Period as follows: (i) in the case of Taxes
that are either (x) based upon or related to income or receipts or (y) imposed
in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of any property,
based on the Taxes which would be payable (after giving effect to amounts
which may be deducted from or offset against such Taxes) if the taxable period
ended on the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic
basis, or otherwise measured by the level of any item with respect to the
assets of any Newco, or with respect to any Assigned IPR, Transferred Asset or
Assumed Liability, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period (after giving effect to amounts which may be deducted from or
offset against such Taxes) (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period),
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of days in the entire Straddle Period. Any credit or refund resulting from an
overpayment of Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be prorated based upon the
method employed in this Section 6.02(b) taking into account the type of Tax to
which the credit or refund relates.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) _Refunds of Certain Taxes_.

 



 

(i) If, as the result of an audit or examination, a claim for refund, the
filing of an amended Tax Return or other determination, there has been a
refund with respect to Taxes that would be Indemnified Pre-Closing Taxes if
unpaid as of the Closing Date or paid pursuant to a claim for indemnification
under Section 9.01, the Buyer shall promptly pay an amount equal to such
refund (net of applicable expenses), and any interest actually received
thereon, to the Seller upon receipt by (including by way of reduction in the
amount of a Tax otherwise payable in the year of such audit or examination,
claim for refund, filing of an amended return or other determination or the
following year by) the Buyer Parties, unless and to the extent that the
entitlement to such refund or reduction was taken into account in computing
the amount of indemnified Loss in respect of such Taxes. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any such refunds of Taxes shall be for the account of the Buyer to
the extent such refunds of Taxes are attributable (determined on a marginal
basis) to the carryback of items of loss, deduction or credit, or other Tax
items, of the Buyer Parties arising after the Closing Date. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Buyer shall not offset any Tax refunds payable to the Seller
hereunder against any indemnifiable Losses except with the prior written
consent of the Seller. The Buyer Parties shall cooperate to the extent
reasonably requested by the Seller in attempting to obtain a refund of any
Taxes that would be Indemnified Pre-Closing Taxes if unpaid as of the Closing
Date or paid pursuant to a claim for indemnification under Section 9.01.

shall promptly pay an amount equal to such refund (net of applicable
expenses), and any interest actually received thereon, to the Buyer upon
receipt by (including by way of reduction in the amount of a Tax otherwise
payable in the year of such audit or examination, such claim for refund, such
filing of an amended return or such other determination or the following year
by) the Seller Parties, unless and to the extent that the entitlement to any
refund or reduction was taken into account in computing the amount of
indemnified Loss in respect of such Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
such refunds of Taxes shall be for the account of the Seller to the extent
such refunds of Taxes are attributable (determined on a marginal basis) to the
carryforward of items of loss, deduction or credit, or other Tax items, of the
Seller Parties arising on or before the Closing Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Seller shall not offset any Tax refunds payable to the Buyer
hereunder against any indemnifiable Losses except with the prior written
consent of the Buyer. The Seller Parties shall cooperate to the extent
reasonably requested by the Buyer in attempting to obtain a refund of any
Taxes that would be Indemnified Post-Closing Taxes if paid pursuant to a claim
for indemnification under Section 9.02.

 



 

(iii) The Buyer or Seller, as applicable, shall repay to the other the
amount paid over pursuant to this Section 6.02(c) (plus any penalties,
interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Taxing Authority) in the
event that the Buyer or Seller, as applicable, is required to repay such
refund to such Taxing Authority. This paragraph shall not be construed to
require the Buyer Parties or the Seller Parties to make available its Tax
Returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems
confidential in its sole discretion) to the other party or any other Person.

whose Affiliate receives, any notice of a pending or Threatened Tax audit,

Liabilities, that may give rise to a right to indemnification pursuant to the
terms of Article 9 shall promptly notify the other Party within five (5)
Business Days of receipt of such notice. The Buyer and the Seller shall
consult with and keep the other informed on a regular basis regarding the
status of any Tax Proceeding to the extent that such Proceeding could
reasonably be expected to affect a liability of either of the Parties
(including indemnity obligations hereunder). The Seller shall have the right
to represent the interests of the Buyer Parties in any Tax Proceeding
pertaining to Indemnified Pre-Closing Taxes or Taxes of the Seller and to
employ counsel of its choice at the Sellers expense in such Proceeding, and
to control the disposition of any issue involved in such Proceeding;
_provided_ that, the Buyer shall have the right to jointly control any such
Proceeding relating solely to the Newcos; _provided_ _further_ that, in any
such Proceeding that could affect the Assigned IPR or Transferred Assets for
any taxable period after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall have the right to
participate in such Proceeding at its own expense and Seller shall not settle
such Proceeding in a manner that could reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the Buyer Parties without the Buyers prior written consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Both the Buyer and
the Seller shall be entitled to represent their own interests in light of
their responsibilities (including indemnity obligations) for related Taxes, at
their own expense, in any Tax Proceeding involving a Straddle Period, or
involving both a taxable period of any of the Newcos ending on or before the
Closing Date and a taxable period ending after the Closing Date, and no such
Proceeding may be settled or compromised by the Seller or the Buyer without
the consent of both the Seller and the Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Except as otherwise provided
in this Section 6.02(d), the provisions of Article 9, including the provisions
therein addressing settlement authority, shall govern the manner in which Tax
Proceedings are conducted.

 



 

(e) _Cooperation, Access to Information and Records Retention_. The
Seller and the Buyer shall cooperate as and to the extent reasonably requested
by the other in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns as
provided herein and any Proceeding with respect to Taxes of the Newcos, or
with respect to the Assigned IPR, Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities.
Such cooperation shall include the provision of records and information
reasonably relevant to any Tax Return or Tax Proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Buyer shall (i) retain all
books and records relevant to Taxes of the Newcos, Assigned IPR, Transferred
Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, including such books and records relating
to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration
of the statute of limitations for assessment of Taxes for such respective
taxable period, and (ii) give the Seller reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the
Seller so requests, the Buyer shall allow the Seller to take possession of or
copy such books and records.

 



 

 



   



 

(f) _Tax Certificates_. The Buyer and the Seller shall, upon request of
the other, use all reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Body, provide any certificate or other
document, or cooperate with the other Party, as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed with respect to the
Transactions. At the Closing, the Seller Parties shall deliver to the Buyer,
as appropriate: (i) with respect to the transfer of the Transferred Assets and
assumption of Assumed Liabilities in the United States under the Business

rulings with respect to the Newcos.

Affiliates of Fujitsu shall not (for themselves or on behalf of any other
Person) engage in the design, manufacture (including having manufactured),
marketing, sale and distribution of any AM Products or products that are
designed primarily to perform the same functionalities as and are capable of
replacing the AM Products (such products, collectively, " _Competing Products_
," and such activities, collectively, " _Competitive Activities_ "). The
Seller Parties shall not permit any of their successors or assigns to engage
in Competitive Activities during the Non-Compete Period.

 



 

(b) _Damages_. Because of the difficulty of measuring economic losses to
the Buyer and its Affiliates as a result of a breach of the foregoing
covenants in this Section 6.03 (as qualified by subsections (d), (e) and (f)
below), and because of the immediate and irreparable damage that could be
caused to the Buyer and its Affiliates for which it would have no other
adequate remedy, the Seller Parties agree that the foregoing covenants in this
Section 6.03 (as qualified by subsections (d), (e) and (f) below) may be
enforced in accordance with Applicable Law by the Buyer in the event of breach
by the Seller Parties, in addition to, but not in lieu of, its other rights
and remedies (including monetary damages) under Applicable Law, by
injunctions, restraining orders or other equitable remedies, without the
necessity of posting an injunction bond.

 



 

(c) _Reasonable Restraint_. It is agreed by the Parties that the
foregoing covenants in this Section 6.03 (as qualified by subsections (d), (e)
and (f) below) impose a reasonable restraint on the Seller Parties or their
successors or assigns, in light of the AM Business on the Effective Date. It
is the intent of the Parties that the provisions of this Section 6.03 be
enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the Applicable Laws applied
in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. If any particular
provisions or portion of this Section 6.03 shall be adjudicated to be invalid
or unenforceable, this Section 6.03 shall be deemed amended to delete
therefrom such provision or portion adjudicated to be invalid or
unenforceable, such amendment to apply only with respect to the operation of
such Section 6.03 in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is
made.

Section 9.03 _Third-Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) In the event that any Buyer Indemnified Party desires to make a claim
against the Seller or any Seller Indemnified Party desires to make a claim
against the Buyer, in each case in connection with any Proceeding, demand or
other claim of a Third Party at any time instituted against, made upon or
threatened against such Indemnified Party for which such Indemnified Party may
seek indemnification hereunder (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified
Party shall promptly notify the applicable Indemnification Control Person of
such Third-Party Claim and the Indemnified Partys claim for indemnification
with respect thereto; provided that, the failure to promptly notify the
applicable Indemnification Control Person shall in no way diminish the
obligations of such Indemnification Control Person under this Article 9 except
to the extent prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 9.03, the
Indemnification Control Person shall have the right to assume the defense of
any Third-Party Claim with counsel of its choice by providing written notice
to the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days after the Indemnification
Control Person has received written notice from the Indemnified Party of such
Third-Party Claim and that the Indemnified Party intends to seek
indemnification therefor. If the Indemnification Control Person elects to
assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnification Control
Person will: (i) conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim with good faith
diligence and keep the Indemnified Party reasonably informed of material
developments, (ii) promptly submit to the Indemnified Party copies of all
pleadings, motions, and other similar legal documents and papers received or
filed in connection therewith, (iii) permit the Indemnified Party and its
counsel to confer on the conduct of the defense thereof, and (iv) permit the
Indemnified Party and its counsel to review all legal papers to be submitted
prior to submission.

Indemnification Control Person shall constitute an admission of responsibility
to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to all Losses related to such
Third-Party Claim and the Indemnification Control Person shall pay all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim
(including attorneys fees, other professionals and experts and court and
arbitration costs), subject to the limitations in this Article 9. The
Indemnification Control Person shall not, in the defense of such claim,
consent to the entry of any judgment (other than a judgment of dismissal on
the merits without costs) or enter into any settlement without the written
consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned, provided, however, that no such consent
shall be required if the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are
reimbursed to the Indemnified Party in full as Losses (subject to the
limitations contained in this Article 9); provided, further, the Indemnified
Party shall have no obligation to consent unless such judgment or settlement
includes, as a condition thereof, an express, unconditional release of the
Indemnified Parties from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such
Third-Party Claim and would not reasonably be expected to establish a
precedent, custom or practice adverse to the continuing business interests of
the Indemnified Party or its business.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnification Control Person assumes the defense of a Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such claim provided that the Indemnified Party shall bear the fees
and expenses of any additional counsel retained by it to participate in its
defense.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) If the Indemnification Control Person (i) does not assume the defense
of a Third-Party Claim after receipt of notice of such Third-Party Claim from
the Indemnified Party pursuant to Sections 9.03(a) and 9.03(b), (ii) fails to
prosecute with good faith diligence or settle such Third-Party Claim in good
faith or (iii) the Indemnified Party, based on advice of counsel, determines
that there is a conflict of interest that would prevent the Indemnification
Control Person from fully and adequately representing the Indemnified Partys
interests with respect to such Third-Party Claim, then in each case, the
Indemnified Party may defend against or settle such claim in such manner as it
reasonably deems appropriate; _provided_ , _however_ , (x) the Indemnified
Party will consult in good faith with the Indemnification Control Person prior
to settling any such Third-Party Claim, and (y) the Indemnification Control
Person shall have the opportunity to participate in the defense of such claim
at its own cost.

 



 

(f) The Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties shall
cooperate in good faith and in all respects with each other and their
respective representatives (including counsel) in the investigation,
negotiation, settlement, trial and/or defense of any Third-Party Claim, and
any appeal arising therefrom, including by sharing documents and other
information with each other, at the others reasonable request, and by making
their personnel available to each other, at the others reasonable request.

such claim and the amount, to the extent known, of the claim asserted. If the
Seller disputes such claim for indemnification, it shall notify the Buyer in
writing within thirty (30) days after its receipt of notice of such claim for
indemnification, whereupon the Buyer and the Seller shall meet and attempt in
good faith to resolve their differences with respect to such claim for
indemnification. If the dispute has not been resolved within thirty (30) days
after such Parties first met to attempt a resolution, either the Seller or the
Buyer may initiate dispute resolution in accordance with Section 11.10. If the
Seller does not dispute such claim for indemnification in writing within
thirty (30) days of the receipt of the notice of such claim from the Buyer or
upon final resolution of any dispute, the Seller shall promptly pay the Buyer
Indemnified Party an amount in Japanese Yen equal to the amount of such claim
with the exchange rate to be applied in converting the Losses determined in
any other currency to Japanese Yen to be the middle currency exchange rate of
TTS and TTB provided by the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ as of the Business

indemnification under this Article 9, the Seller shall give reasonably prompt
written notice to the Buyer specifying the facts constituting the basis for
such claim and the amount, to the extent known, of the claim asserted. If the

writing within thirty (30) days after its receipt of notice of such claim for
indemnification, whereupon the Buyer and the Seller shall meet and attempt in

indemnification. If the dispute has not been resolved within thirty (30) days
after such Parties first met to attempt a resolution, either the Seller or the
Buyer may initiate dispute resolution in accordance with Section 11.10. If the
Buyer does not dispute such claim for indemnification in writing within thirty
(30) days of the receipt of the notice of such claim from the Seller or upon
final resolution of any dispute, the Buyer shall pay, or shall cause the
Company to pay, the Seller Indemnified Party an amount in Japanese Yen equal
to the amount of such claim with the exchange rate to be applied in converting
the Losses determined in any other currency to Japanese Yen to be the middle
currency exchange rate of TTS and TTB provided by the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ as of the Business Day immediately prior to the date of payment of such
amount.

Buyer Parties (including the commissions, fees or other compensation of the

(b) Any capital registration Taxes of a Newco resulting from the Fujitsu

The Parties shall cooperate to reduce such capital registration Taxes.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in any Ancillary Document, all Transaction

including any applicable penalties and interest (collectively, the " _Transfer
Taxes_ ") incurred in connection with the consummation of the transactions to

including court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements. Any
such attorneys fees and other expenses incurred by any Party in enforcing a

remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective

(a) If any fact or event becomes known to the Seller after the Effective
Date that is inconsistent with any of the Sellers representations and
warranties in Article 3 or in the Overseas Seller Party Disclosure Certificate
and was not the result of the willful failure by any Seller Party to perform
any of its obligations under any Ancillary Document, the Inventory Purchase
and Sale Agreement or the Equipment Tester Transfer Agreement (a " _New Fact_
"), the Seller shall have the right (but not the obligation) to notify the
Buyer thereof in writing (a " _New Fact Notice_ ") in accordance with Section
11.08. Any New Fact Notice shall be prominently labelled "New Fact Notice."
The Seller shall include with each New Fact Notice a supplement to the Seller
Disclosure Schedules or Overseas Seller Party Disclosure Schedules (as the
case may be) that includes a reasonable disclosure of the New Fact (the "
_Supplemental Seller Disclosure Schedules_ ") and such Supplemental Seller
Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to be incorporated into, amend and
supplement the Seller Disclosure Schedules or Overseas Seller Party Disclosure
Schedules as of the Closing Date (but shall not amend the Sellers
representations and warranties as of the Effective Date or the date of the
Overseas Seller Party Disclosure Certificate).

 



 

 



   



 

(b) If the Seller delivers a New Fact Notice or Supplemental Seller
Disclosure Schedule later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the anticipated
Closing Date, the Closing Date shall be postponed for at least ten (10)
Business Days and rescheduled in accordance with the terms and conditions
hereof, including Section 2.01.

 



 

(c) If a New Fact would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the AM Business, taken as a whole, the Buyer may, by delivering
written notice to the Seller (a " _Walkaway Notice_ ") within three (3)
Business Days after receiving the New Fact Notice, terminate this Agreement
and the Fujitsu Pre-Closing Undertaking (the " _Walkaway Right_ "). The
Walkaway Right of the Buyer Parties with respect to a New Fact shall expire if
the Buyer does not deliver a Walkaway Notice within three (3) Business Days
after receiving the applicable New Fact Notice.

 



 

(d) The Walkaway Right shall be the Buyers sole remedy in respect of a
New Fact that (i) would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the AM Business, taken as a whole, and (ii) has been disclosed
pursuant to this Section 11.05, and the Buyer shall not be entitled to claim
that any such New Fact constitutes a breach by the Seller of its
representations and warranties as of the Closing Date in this Agreement or in
the Sellers Closing Date Bringdown Certificate. The Supplemental Seller
Disclosure Schedules shall not cure any misrepresentation or breach of
warranty by Seller made on and as of the Effective Date or excuse or cure any
breach by a Seller Party of its covenants or agreements in this Agreement or
any other Ancillary Document.

 



 

(e) If a New Fact (i) would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the AM Business, taken as a whole, and (ii) has been
disclosed pursuant to this Section 11.05, then the failure of a representation
and warranty made by the Seller in this Agreement to be true shall not be
grounds for the Buyer Parties to refuse to perform their obligations to effect
the Transactions at the Closing, but the Buyer shall have indemnification
rights with respect to such failure in accordance with Article 9 hereof.

 



 

Section 11.06 _Succession and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Except as otherwise provided herein, no Party may

without the prior written approval of the other Party.

instrument. The counterparts of this Agreement may be executed and delivered

delivered by facsimile or other electronic method as if the original had been

and any other Transaction Agreement or the subject matter hereof shall be
finally settled under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the " _Rules_ ") of
the Japan Commercial Arbitration Association (the " _Arbitration Organization_
"), unless otherwise agreed, by an arbitral tribunal composed of one (1)
arbitrator appointed by agreement of the Buyer and the Seller in accordance
with the Rules. In the event the Buyer and the Seller fail to agree upon an
arbitrator from the first list of potential arbitrators proposed by the
Arbitration Organization, the Arbitration Organization shall submit a second
list. In the event the Buyer and the Seller shall have failed to agree upon an
arbitrator from such second list, an arbitrator shall be appointed by the
Arbitration Organization in accordance with the Rules. If at the time of the
arbitration the Buyer and the Seller agree in writing to submit the dispute to
another single arbitrator, subject to the Applicable Law or the Rules, such
single arbitrator shall be appointed by agreement of the Buyer and the Seller
in connection with the foregoing procedure or, failing such agreement, by the
Arbitration Organization in accordance with the Rules. The arbitrator shall be
a neutral arbitrator (not a national of the United States or Japan) and
subject to the Rules.

 



 

(b) The arbitrator shall apply the laws of Japan, shall not have the
authority to add to, detract from, or modify any provision hereof and shall
not award punitive damages to any injured Party. A decision by the arbitrator
shall be final, conclusive and binding. The arbitrator shall deliver a written
and reasoned award with respect to the dispute to each of the parties to the
dispute, difference, controversy or claim, who shall promptly act in
accordance therewith. Any arbitration proceeding shall be held in Tokyo,
Japan.

 



 

(c) The arbitration proceedings conducted pursuant to this Section 11.10
shall be confidential. No Party shall disclose any information about the
arbitration proceedings or the evidence adduced by the other Party in any
arbitration proceeding or about documents provided by the other Party in
connection with the proceeding except in the course of a judicial, regulatory
or arbitration proceeding or as may be requested by a Governmental Body or as
required or advisable under Applicable Law or exchange rules. Before making
any disclosure permitted by the preceding sentence, the Party intending to
make such disclosure shall give the other Party reasonable written notice of
the intended disclosure. The Parties shall sign, and the arbitrator, expert
witnesses and stenographic reporters shall be asked to sign, appropriate non-
disclosure agreements or orders in order to effectuate this Agreement of the
Parties as to confidentiality.

 



 

(d) The Parties hereby exclude any right of appeal to any court on the
merits of the dispute. The provisions of this Section 11.10 may be enforced in
any court having jurisdiction over the award or any Party or any of its
respective assets, and judgment on the award (including equitable remedies)
granted in any arbitration hereunder may be entered in any such court. Nothing
contained in this Section 11.10 shall prevent any Party from seeking
injunctive or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction,
without the need to resort to arbitration.

 



 

Section 11.11 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by

or any default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant
hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be valid unless the same shall be
in writing and signed by the Party making such waiver, nor shall such waiver
be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or
breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights
arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 11.12 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect

the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

Section 11.13 _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement. The Parties intend that each
representation, warranty and covenant contained herein shall have independent
significance. Any reference in this Agreement to a statute shall be to such
statute, as amended from time to time, and to the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. When reference is made in this Agreement to an
exhibit, appendix, schedule, Article, Section or subsection, such reference
