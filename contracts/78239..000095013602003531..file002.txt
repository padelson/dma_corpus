and, together with CKI, CK Europe I, CK Europe II and CK Italy, the "CK

TRUST FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE ISSUE OF CALVIN KLEIN (the "Klein Trust"), TRUST
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE ISSUE OF BARRY SCHWARTZ (the "Schwartz Trust"),
STEPHANIE SCHWARTZ-FERDMAN ("Schwartz-Ferdman") and JONATHAN SCHWARTZ ("J.
Schwartz" and, together with Mr. Klein, Mr. Schwartz, the Klein Trust, the
Schwartz Trust and Schwartz-Ferdman, the "Sellers").   W I T N E S S E T
H:   WHEREAS, the Sellers are the owners of all of the issued and
outstanding shares of the capital stock (or all of the outstanding parts of
capital in the case of CK Italy) of each CK Company (the "Purchase
Shares");   WHEREAS, PVH desires to purchase and acquire from the Sellers,
and the Sellers desire to sell and transfer to PVH, the Purchase Shares on
the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth;   WHEREAS,
PVH desires to purchase and acquire from Mr. Klein, and Mr. Klein desires to
sell and transfer to PVH, his rights under the Design Services Agreement (as
herein defined); and   WHEREAS, terms used in this Agreement and not
otherwise defined in this Agreement are defined in Appendix A hereto.  
NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE I.  
CLOSING; SALE AND PURCHASE    1.1 The Closing. The closing (the "Closing")
of the transactions contained in this Article I shall take place at 10:00
A.M., Eastern Time, on the second Business Day after all of the conditions
contained in Articles VII and VIII have been satisfied or waived (other than
those conditions which will be satisfied at the Closing Time), provided,
that, if the HSR Clearance in connection with the Apax Transaction has not
been received by such second Business Day, then (i) the conditions contained
in Sections 7.1, 7.8 and 7.9 shall be deemed to have been satisfied as of
such second Business Day (the "HSR Date") and (ii) the Closing shall take
place at 10:00    A.M., Eastern Time, on the second Business Day after
such HSR Clearance has been received; provided, further, that if all the
conditions contained in Articles VII and VIII have been satisfied or waived,
the Closing shall take place not later than the Termination Date, or at such
other time or such other date as PVH and the Sellers may agree, at the
offices of Katten Muchin Zavis Rosenman, 575 Madison Avenue, New York, New
York. (Hereinafter, such date is referred to as the "Closing Date" and such
time on the Closing Date is referred to as the "Closing Time.")   1.2 Sale
and Purchase of the Purchase Shares. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, at the Closing, the Sellers agree to
sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver to PVH certificates (or such
other appropriate evidences of ownership with respect to CK Italy)
representing the Purchase Shares, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by
stock or other appropriate powers in blank with all appropriate transfer
stamps affixed thereto (the "Stock Certificates"), and PVH (and its designee
in the case of CK Italy) agrees to purchase from the Sellers the Purchase
Shares, for an aggregate purchase price consisting of (i) $400,000,000 in
cash (the "Cash Purchase Price"), as adjusted in accordance with Section 1.4,
and (ii) such number of shares of PVH Common Stock equal to the quotient of
(x) $30,000,000 over (y) the PVH Common Stock Closing Price (the "PVH Shares"
and, together with the Cash Purchase Price, the "Purchase Price").   1.3
Delivery of Purchase Price and Stock Certificates. (a) At the Closing, (i)
the Cash Purchase Price shall be paid by PVH to the Sellers by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to accounts designated in writing by
the Sellers at least two Business Days prior to the Closing, (ii) subject to
Section 1.3(b), the PVH Shares shall be delivered by PVH to the Sellers, and
(iii) the Stock Certificates shall be delivered by the Sellers to PVH, and in
the case of (i) and (ii) in the proportions as set forth on Exhibit A.  
(b) At the Closing Time, the Holdback Shares shall be deposited in escrow and
held pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement in substantially the
form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Escrow Agreement"). The Sellers
agree, that, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, all of the
certificates representing the Holdback Shares shall be delivered, along with
stock powers executed by such Sellers in blank, to the escrow agent named
therein.   1.4 Purchase Price Adjustment. In accordance with the procedures
set forth in this Section 1.4, the Cash Purchase Price shall be adjusted as
follows:   (a) At least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
chief financial officer of CKI, on behalf of the Sellers, shall deliver to
PVH a good faith estimate (as adjusted, the "Estimated Closing Net Book
Value") of the Closing Date Net Book Value prepared in accordance with GAAP
and the resulting Net Book Value Overage or Net Book Value Underage. A "Net
Book Value Overage" shall exist when (and shall be equal to the amount by
which) the Estimated Closing Net Book Value exceeds the Base Amount. A "Net
Book Value Underage" shall exist when (and shall be equal to the amount by
which) the Base Amount exceeds the Estimated Closing Net Book Value. Within
five Business Days following the Closing Date, in the event of a Net Book
Value Overage, PVH shall pay the amount of such Net Book Value Overage to the
Sellers in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 1.3 (subject
to adjustment only in the event that the Estimated Closing Net Book Value, on
its face,    2  fails to properly apply GAAP or contains material
mathematical error) and in the event of a Net Book Value Underage, PVH shall
receive, in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, such number of Holdback
Shares equal to the quotient of (i) an amount equal to the Net Book Value
Underage, over (ii) the PVH Common Stock Closing Price (subject to adjustment
only in the event that the Estimated Closing Net Book Value, on its face,
fails to properly apply GAAP or contains material mathematical error). Within
90 days after the Closing Date, PVH shall deliver to the Sellers a combined
balance sheet for the CK Companies as of the Closing Date and after giving
effect to any payments made or other actions taken by the Sellers to satisfy
or discharge the CK Debt Obligations pursuant to Section 1.6 or in
satisfaction of the condition contained in Section 7.16 (and prior to giving
effect to any action by PVH or its Affiliates that would impact such balance
sheet) prepared in accordance with GAAP (the "Closing Date
Balance Sheet").   (b) The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall become final
and binding upon the parties on the 30th day following delivery thereof,
unless the Sellers give written notice of their disagreement with the Closing
Date Balance Sheet (a "Notice of Disagreement") to PVH prior to such date.
Any Notice of Disagreement shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the nature
of any disagreement so asserted and (ii) only include disagreements based on
mathematical errors or based on the Closing Date Balance Sheet not being
calculated pursuant to this Section 1.4 or in accordance with GAAP. If a
Notice of Disagreement is received by PVH in a timely manner, then the
Closing Date Balance Sheet (as revised in accordance with this sentence)
shall become final and binding upon PVH and the Sellers on the earlier of (A)
the date PVH and the Sellers resolve in writing any differences they have
with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (B)
the date any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the
Accounting Firm. During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Notice
of Disagreement, PVH and the Sellers shall seek in good faith to resolve in
writing any differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such 30-day period,
PVH and the Sellers shall submit to an independent accounting firm
(the "Accounting Firm") for arbitration, in accordance with the standards set
forth in this Section 1.4, only matters that remain in dispute and were
properly included in the Notice of Disagreement in accordance with this
Section 1.4, in the form of a written brief. The Accounting Firm shall be
KPMG LLP or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other
nationally recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed
upon by PVH and the Sellers in writing. PVH and the Sellers shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a
written decision resolving the matters submitted to the Accounting Firm
within 30 days of the receipt of such submission. The scope of the disputes
to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to whether the items
in dispute that were properly included in the Notice of Disagreement were
determined pursuant to this Section 1.4 and in accordance with GAAP and
whether there were mathematical errors in the Closing Date Balance Sheet, and
the Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination, including any
determination as to whether the Base Amount is correct. The Accounting
Firm\'s decision shall be based solely on written submissions by PVH and the
Sellers and their respective representatives and not by independent review.
The Accounting Firm shall address only those items in dispute and may not
assign a value greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either party or smaller than the smallest value for such item claimed by
either party. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of
the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the party
against    3   which such determination is to be enforced. The fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred pursuant to this Section 1.4 shall
be borne by PVH and the Sellers equally.   (c) If the Base Amount is less
than the Closing Date Net Book Value, PVH shall, and if the Base Amount is
more than the Closing Date Net Book Value, the Sellers shall, within ten
Business Days after the Closing Date Balance Sheet becomes final and binding
on the parties, make payment to the other party by wire transfer in
immediately available funds of the amount of such difference, net of any
adjustment made as a result of any Net Book Value Overage or Net Book Value
Underage, as applicable, without interest (the "Adjustment Payment"). If the
Sellers are required to make an Adjustment Payment to PVH in accordance
with this Section 1.4, and such Adjustment Payment is not received by PVH
within such ten Business Day period, then, PVH shall receive such number of
Holdback Shares equal to the quotient of (i) an amount equal to such
Adjustment Payment over (ii) the PVH Common Stock Closing Price, in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement. The parties agree that if PVH receives
Holdback Shares as a result of a Net Book Value Underage and if PVH is
required to make an Adjustment Payment in accordance with this subsection
(c), then, PVH shall, first, be entitled to return to the Sellers such number
of Holdback Shares equal to the quotient of (i) an amount equal to such
Adjustment Payment over (ii) the PVH Common Stock Closing Price, and, second,
with respect to the balance of such Adjustment Payment, if any, make payment
to the Sellers in accordance with the first sentence of this subsection
(c).   (d) Following the Closing, PVH shall not, and shall not permit the
CK Companies to, take any action with respect to the accounting books and
records of the CK Companies, or the items reflected thereon, on which the
Closing Date Balance Sheet is to be based, that is inconsistent with GAAP or
which would impair the ability of any party to make any calculation, or
determine the grounds for any Notice of Disagreement, contemplated by this
Section 1.4. During the period of time from and after the Closing Date
through the final determination of the Closing Date Net Book Value in
accordance with this Section 1.4, PVH shall afford, and shall cause the CK
Companies to afford, to the Sellers and any accountants, counsel or financial
advisers retained by the Sellers in connection with the determination of the
Closing Date Net Book Value in accordance with this Section 1.4, access
during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to the books,
records, personnel and representatives (including the CK Companies\'
accountants) of the CK Companies relevant to the preparation of the Closing
Date Balance Sheet and the determination of the Closing Date Net Book Value
in accordance with this Section 1.4.   1.5 Purchase of Design Services
Agreement.   (a) Mr. Klein hereby agrees to sell, assign and transfer to PVH
at the Closing all of his rights under and pursuant to the Design Services
Agreement. In consideration of the foregoing, (i) effective at the Closing
Time, PVH shall deliver to Mr. Klein the Warrant, and CKI shall release Mr.
Klein from his obligations under the Design Services Agreement, and (ii)
within 45 days after the end of each PVH fiscal quarter, commencing with the
quarter during which the Closing occurs (the "Initial Quarter") and ending
with the first PVH fiscal quarter that ends after the Payment Period, PVH
shall make payments (the "Design Services Purchase Payments") to Mr. Klein or
his heirs, successors or assigns (the "Klein Heirs") equal to the   
4   Design Services Rate multiplied by the Total Sales during such
quarter; provided, however, that with respect to the Initial Quarter, PVH
shall make such Design Services Purchase Payment to Mr. Klein or the Klein
Heirs, as the case may be, equal to the product of (x) the Design Services
Rate multiplied by Total Sales for the Initial Quarter, and (y) a fraction,
(i) the numerator of which is the number of days from and including the
Closing Date to and including the last day of the Initial Quarter, and (ii)
the denominator of which is the number of days in the Initial Quarter;
provided, further, however, that with respect to the quarter during which the
Payment Period ends (the "Final Quarter"), PVH shall make such Design
Services Purchase Payment to Mr. Klein equal to the product of (x) the Design
Services Rate multiplied by Total Sales for the Final Quarter, and (y) a
fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the number of days from and including
the first day of the Final Quarter to and including the last day of the
Payment Period, and (ii) the denominator of which is the number of days in
the Final Quarter. For purposes of this Section 1.5, Total Sales shall mean
(without duplication), (A) total worldwide wholesale "net sales"
(i.e., invoiced price less actual returns, allowances, customary and usual
trade discounts granted and itemized insurance, taxes and freight) by PVH and
its Affiliates of all products Bearing the Marks marketed, distributed or
sold during the applicable PVH fiscal quarter ("Wholesale Direct Sales"), (B)
total worldwide wholesale net sales or retail net sales, as the case may be,
of all products Bearing the Marks under licenses and other agreements between
PVH and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and its licensees and the others to
whom PVH or any of its Affiliates has granted the right to use the Marks, on
the other hand, which net sales for purposes hereof shall mean the net sales
reported by such licensees and the other Persons (taking into account any
increases or decreases in such reported amounts through the exercise of audit
rights or any other adjustments) during the applicable PVH fiscal quarter
("Licensee Sales"), (C) total worldwide retail sales (i.e., cost to PVH or
its Affiliates plus 15% for all regular items and transfer pricing for
surplus goods, close-outs and other distressed goods) by PVH and its
Affiliates of products Bearing the Marks ("Retail Direct Sales"), (D) total
worldwide retail sales (i.e., cost to PVH or its Affiliate plus 15% for all
regular items and transfer pricing for surplus goods, close-outs and other
distressed goods) by PVH and its Affiliates of all products not Bearing the
Marks but which are sold under the CK Umbrella, (E) with respect to goods and
services other than products in the Restricted Business, total Wholesale
Direct Sales, Licensee Sales and Retail Direct Sales, as the case may be, of
all goods and services and other worldwide revenue from goods and services
either Bearing the Marks or marketed under the Marks (i.e, the basis upon
which PVH or an Affiliate receives payments from a licensee or other
authorized user, for example, food and beverage sales in a "CK Restaurant" or
hotel rooms in a "CK Hotel"), and (F) with respect to the
Administration Agreement, dated March 14, 1994, between CKI and Warnaco Inc.,
net sales of Women\'s Intimate Apparel and Men\'s Underwear (as such terms
are defined therein) by Warnaco Inc. and their affiliates and net proceeds of
any licensees and sub-licensees of such Warnaco entities, in each case as and
to the extent provided in said Administration Agreement. For purposes of this
Section 1.5, "Bearing the Marks" shall mean a Mark displayed on the product
in question or on its labels or packaging. It is being acknowledged that on
or after the Closing Date, PVH may change its corporate name to a name
including a Mark (the "New Corporate Name") and after adoption of the New
Corporate Name, if the New Corporate Name is displayed on the labeling or
packaging of a product to identify (in a manner customary in the industry)
the New Corporate Name as merely the manufacturer, distributor or seller of
such product or the owner of a trademark, tradename or service mark other
than a Mark (e.g., Izod,    5   manufactured by CKI), then such use of
the Corporate Name and such product shall not be included within this
definition of Bearing the Marks. For purposes of this Agreement, "CK
Umbrella" shall include the marketing, distribution or sale (i) in any store,
catalogue, web site or other direct-to-consumer channel (each, a "Channel")
controlled by PVH or its Affiliates (a "PVH Channel") the primary branding of
which PVH Channel includes one of the Marks or where one of the Marks is a
principal element in the marketing or advertising for such PVH Channel; (ii)
in any PVH Channel where at least 50% of the net sales are derived from
products Bearing the Marks; or (iii) in any Channel where there is a "shop-
in-shop" or similar dedicated area for the sale of products Bearing the Marks
and PVH or its Affiliates have directed or permitted the operator of
such Channel to include for sale within such area other products of PVH not
Bearing the Marks. All Design Services Purchase Payments due to Mr. Klein or
the Klein Heirs, as the case may be, pursuant to this Section 1.5 shall be
paid to Mr. Klein or such Klein Heirs at the address designated pursuant to
Section 11.2 or by wire transfer of funds to an account designated by Mr.
Klein or such Klein Heirs in a notice to PVH pursuant to Section 11.2. Except
as otherwise provided in this Section 1.5, PVH shall not be obligated to pay
interest on the Design Services Purchase Payments and shall report the
payment of the Design Services Purchase Payments in accordance with the
Code.   (b) At the time each Design Services Purchase Payment is due, PVH
shall deliver to Mr. Klein or the Klein Heirs, as the case may be, a written
statement (each, a "Payment Statement") setting forth the amount of the
Design Services Purchase Payment payable pursuant to Section 1.5(a) with
respect to such quarter and the calculation thereof. Each Payment Statement
shall be delivered to Mr. Klein or the Klein Heirs, as the case may be, in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C.   (c) Mr. Klein or the
Klein Heirs and/or their respective authorized representatives shall have the
right one time with respect to each fiscal year of PVH (although such right
may also be exercised as to multiple years (up to three years at any one
time) at the same time or as to partial years), during normal business hours
and upon reasonable prior notice, during the Payment Period and for two years
thereafter, to audit and copy those books, records and supporting
documentation of PVH (and to the extent PVH can make them available, the
workpapers of PVH\'s accountants) pertaining to transactions arising out
of or relating to this Section 1.5, and may have access to employees of PVH
and its Affiliates who are responsible for overseeing or are directly
involved in calculating Design Services Purchase Payments for purposes of
asking questions and obtaining information relating to such calculations.
Acceptance by Mr. Klein or the Klein Heirs, as the case may be, of any Design
Services Purchase Payment shall not preclude Mr. Klein or the Klein Heirs, as
the case may be, from questioning its correctness; provided, however, that
once Mr. Klein or the Klein Heirs, as the case may be, has exercised his or
their right to audit the books, records, supporting documentation and/or ask
questions of PVH employees pursuant to this Section 1.5(c) with respect to
any period during the Payment Period, he or they, as the case may be, shall
thereafter be barred from disputing the accuracy of any Design Services
Purchase Payment or Payment Statement received during the portion of the
Payment Period examined, unless Mr. Klein or the Klein Heirs, as the case may
be, raises an objection to any such payment or statement within one year
after all reasonably requested books, records, supporting documentation and
personnel are made available for such audit.    6    (d) If Mr. Klein or
the Klein Heirs, as the case may be, shall raise any objections with respect
to any Payment Statement and related Design Services Purchase Payment during
the Payment Period or within the two-year period after the Payment Period
(but subject to the limitations set forth in Section 1.5(c)), then Mr. Klein
or the Klein Heirs, as the case may be, on the one hand, and PVH, on the
other hand, shall attempt promptly to resolve the matter or matters
in dispute. If the dispute is so resolved, then the applicable Payment
Statement shall be revised in accordance with the resolution, and shall be
final and binding on all parties hereto. If the resolution of a dispute
requires PVH to pay additional amounts (i.e., the revised calculation of the
Design Services Purchase Payment exceeds the amount of the Design Services
Purchase Payment set forth in the applicable Payment Statement) then PVH
shall make payment to Mr. Klein or the Klein Heirs, as the case may be, of
such additional amounts. If such dispute cannot be resolved by Mr. Klein or
the Klein Heirs, as the case may be, on the one hand, and PVH, on the other
hand, within 30 Business Days after the delivery of the objection, then the
specific matters in dispute shall be submitted to mediation in accordance
with Section 11.7. Notwithstanding Sections 11.1 and 11.7, if the
determination of the aggregate amount of the Design Services Purchase
Payments by the mediators for the period of time in dispute (i) exceeds the
aggregate amount set forth in the Payment Statements by $500,000 or more, PVH
shall bear all the fees and expenses of the mediation, or (ii) is less than
$100,000 in excess of the aggregate amount thereof set forth in the Payment
Statements, Mr. Klein or the Klein Heirs, as the case may be, shall bear all
the fees and expenses of the mediation; otherwise each party shall bear
its own expenses of such mediation and share equally the other costs of
such mediation. If the resolution of a dispute in accordance with this
Section 1.5 requires PVH to pay additional amounts to Mr. Klein or the Klein
Heirs, as the case may be, then PVH shall make payment to Mr. Klein or the
Klein Heirs, as the case may be, of such additional amounts plus, in the case
of any such payment which is greater than $1,000,000, interest at the rate of
15% per annum, and, in the case of any such payment which is equal to or less
than $1,000,000, interest at the prime lending rate as in effect on the date
such payment is due as established by JPMorgan Chase Bank (or its successor)
in New York, New York, in each case from the date the original payment was
due to Mr. Klein or the Klein Heirs, as the case may be, until such payment
is made in accordance with this Section 1.5; provided, however, no such
interest shall accrue or be required to be paid by PVH as a result of
increases in Design Services Purchase Payments because of changes in amounts
reported to PVH by the licensees and other third parties to whom rights to
use the Marks have been granted; provided, that Mr. Klein is paid all such
amounts as part of the next Design Services Purchase Payment due to Mr.
Klein. Any Design Services Purchase Payment which is not made to Mr. Klein or
the Klein Heirs, as the case may be, as a result of a default in payment by
PVH shall accrue interest at 15% per annum; provided, however, no such
interest shall accrue or be required to be paid by PVH as a result
of increases in Design Services Purchase Payments because of changes in
amounts reported to PVH by the licensees and other third parties to whom
rights to use the Marks have been granted. Notwithstanding any Design
Services Purchase Payment made hereunder, such payment shall not restrict or
compromise PVH\'s right to dispute (with respect to the three-year period
prior to any such dispute) that an overpayment was made to Mr. Klein or the
Klein Heirs.   (e) For income Tax purposes, PVH, the Sellers and the CK
Companies agree that they will report the Design Services Purchase Payments
as made in exchange solely for the surrender by Mr. Klein of all his rights
under the Design Services Agreement and that except for    7   the
portion of such payment required to be treated as interest for income
Tax purposes and except for changes in Law, the parties agree to file their
Tax Returns accordingly.   (f) If PVH defaults in the payment of any Design
Services Purchase Payment for more than 30 days after the same becomes due
and payable or any other Event of Default (as defined in the Design Services
Security Agreement) occurs (each such default, a "Design Services Purchase
Payment Default"), Mr. Klein or the Klein Heirs may, at their option declare
that the entire amount of all unpaid Design Services Purchase Payments
together with the Liquidated Damages Amount shall be immediately due and
payable, in each and every case without presentment, demand, protest or
further notice, all of which are hereby waived. The parties acknowledge that,
in the event of a Design Services Purchase Payment Default, precise damages
would be difficult or impossible to calculate and expressly agree that the
Liquidated Damages Amount is a fair and reasonable estimate of such damages
and that the Liquidated Damages Amount is not a penalty. The parties
acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this Section 1.5(f) are for the
mutual benefit of the parties and are intended to avoid a protracted dispute
respecting damages occurring by reason of a Design Services Purchase Payment
Default. In the event the Design Services Purchase Payments together with the
Liquidated Damages Amount shall be declared immediately due and payable
pursuant to this Section 1.5(f), PVH shall have the right to make a one-time
request within 30 days of such declaration by giving written notice to Mr.
Klein or the Klein Heirs, as the case may be, and upon receipt of
such notice, Mr. Klein or the Klein Heirs, as the case may be, shall rescind
any such declaration and its consequences if (i) the Design Services Purchase
Payment Default upon which such declaration was based shall have resulted
from the inability of PVH to receive information from third parties necessary
to calculate the amount of such Design Services Purchase Payment in a
timely manner, (ii) PVH has paid in full all overdue Design Services Purchase
Payments and all overdue interest on such Design Services Purchase Payments,
(iii) no default or event of default shall have occurred and be continuing
with respect to the Design Services Security Agreement, the Guarantee or any
Material Indebtedness (as defined in the Design Services Security Agreement),
and (iv) no judgment or decree has been entered for the payment of any monies
due pursuant to this Agreement. No rescission under this Section 1.5(f) will
extend to or affect any subsequent Design Services Purchase Payment Default
or impair any right arising in connection therewith.   (g) In connection
with this Section 1.5, at the Closing, PVH and Mr. Klein shall enter into the
Design Services Security Agreement.   (h) Except as otherwise provided in
this subsection (h), all amounts payable pursuant to this Section 1.5 shall
be paid without reduction, set-off or counterclaim of any kind. Any breach by
Mr. Klein of any of his obligations under this Agreement for which amounts
are required to be paid to a PVH Group Member, upon and in accordance with a
final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction finding
such a breach, or otherwise as agreed to in writing by the parties, shall
entitle PVH to offset against the Design Services Purchase Payments.   1.6
Satisfaction of Debt. The Sellers shall cause all of the
obligations (including, without limitation, any contingent obligations,
whether by guarantee or otherwise), of each CK    8   Company in
respect of debt for borrowed money (other than any Customs performance bonds,
trade letters of credit covering purchases of inventory and stand-by letters
of credit covering obligations under certain leases and the capitalized
leases, guarantees of employee credit cards and any intercompany indebtedness
set forth in the CK Companies Disclosure Schedule), together with any
interest accruing on any such obligation (the "CK Debt Obligations") to
be repaid in full and cancelled by no later than the Closing Time, or shall
cause such CK Company to be released and discharged from such obligations
effective prior to the Closing Time and shall cause all Liens granted under
the Line Letter to be discharged; it being understood that (i) the CK Debt
Obligations may be paid simultaneously at Closing with the proceeds of the
Cash Purchase Price, and (ii) PVH shall not acquire or assume any obligations
of any CK Company in respect of debt for borrowed money except as provided in
this Section 1.6. Set forth on the CK Companies Disclosure Schedule is a list
of all of the performance bonds and trade letters of credit of the CK
Companies as are in effect on the date hereof. Within ten Business Days prior
to the Closing, the Sellers shall provide to PVH a list of each then
outstanding letter of credit, stating the letter of credit number, the
issuing bank, the name, address and country of the beneficiary, the purchase
orders covered, the expiration date and the amount outstanding on the day the
list is compiled with respect to each outstanding letter of credit, as well
as a list of each Customs performance bond then outstanding, stating the
amount, issuer, beneficiary, permitted importers, amount of premium and date
of the last premium payment and the due date of the next premium payment with
respect to each such bond. Within five Business Days prior to the Closing,
PVH shall provide to the Sellers a list of the letters of credit and Customs
performance bonds it can and is willing to assume and will replace such
letters of credit and performance bonds not being assumed by
PVH. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall PVH\'s inability or unwillingness to assume any such letters
of credit and Customs performance bonds give rise to any breach on the part
of the Sellers or the CK Companies hereunder or the failure of any condition
to PVH\'s obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as it
relates to the obligations of the CK Companies underlying such letters of
credit and Customs performance bonds or in respect of which such letters of
credit or performance bonds were issued or the impact thereof on the business
of the CK Companies.   1.7 Releases. Each Seller, on behalf of himself,
herself or itself, and also on behalf of his, her or its heirs, successors
and/or assigns, unconditionally and irrevocably waives and relinquishes as of
the Closing Date, any claims (and resulting damages) which he, she or it has,
had, may have or claims to have had against any CK Company, the CK Trust, PVH
or PVH\'s Affiliates (in the case of PVH and its Affiliates (other than any
CK Company or the CK Trust) solely as a result of PVH\'s ownership of the CK
Companies after the Closing Date), from the beginning of the world through
the date of the Closing, other than claims in respect of, or relating to,
this Agreement, each Related Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. PVH, on behalf of itself, its Affiliates and the CK Companies (as
constituted after the Closing) and also on behalf of their respective heirs,
successors and/or assigns, unconditionally and irrevocably waives and
relinquishes as of the Closing Date, any claims (and resulting damages) which
the CK Companies, the CK Trust, PVH or PVH\'s Affiliates (in the case of PVH
and its Affiliates, solely as a result of PVH\'s ownership of the CK
Companies after the Closing Date) has, had, may have or claims to have had
against any Seller from the beginning of the world through the date of
the Closing, other than claims in respect of, or relating to, this Agreement,
each Related Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.   
9    1.8 Actions Simultaneous. All actions to be taken and all documents to
be executed and delivered by all parties at the Closing shall be deemed to
have been taken and executed and delivered simultaneously and no actions
shall be deemed to have been taken nor shall any documents be deemed to have
been executed and delivered until all actions have been taken and all
documents have been executed and delivered.   ARTICLE II.

good standing as a foreign corporation in all jurisdictions in which
the nature of the business and activities conducted by it, and/or the
character of the assets owned or leased by it, makes such qualification or

any CK Company\'s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and by the Related Agreements or have a CK Companies Material Adverse
Effect.    12    (b) The CK Trust is a Delaware business trust, was duly

other similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors\' rights and to general equity principles.   3.4 Non-
Contravention. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Related
Agreements by each CK Company (to the extent a party thereto) does not, and
the consummation by any such CK Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby and by such Related Agreements and compliance by any such CK Company

constitute a violation or breach of the articles or certificate of 
incorporation, as applicable, or the by-laws of any CK Company;   (ii)

(a "Qualified Plan") has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to
be so qualified and nothing to the Knowledge of the Sellers or any CK Company

such qualified status. There are no pending, threatened or anticipated

Company Plans, or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers or any CK Company, any of
the Union Plans, with respect to or affecting any CK Company or any current

3.20(e) of the CK Companies Disclosure Schedule).   (f) A complete and
correct copy of each of the Company Plans and each of the International

Company Plan that is not in written form, an accurate and complete
description of such Company Plan has been provided to PVH. With respect to

each of (i) the three most recent annual reports (Form 5500 series), and (ii)

by applicable Law or (ii) death benefits or retirement benefits under any
"employee pension plan," as that term is defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA.   (i) Except as set forth in the CK Companies Disclosure Schedules,
neither the execution and delivery by the Sellers or any CK Company of this
Agreement or the Related Agreements nor the consummation by the Sellers of
the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Related Agreements shall
(either alone or upon the occurrence of additional events or acts) (x)
require any CK Company to make any payment to, or obtain any consent or
waiver from, any officer, director, employee, consultant or agent of any
member of the Group or (y) accelerate vesting or payment of any benefits or
any payments, increase the amount or value of any benefit or payment.   
29    (j) The CK Companies Disclosure Schedule separately identifies
each International Plan as well as each severance or other post
termination arrangement applicable to International Employees. Any and all
amounts that any member of the Group is required to pay as contribution or
otherwise with respect to each International Plan have been timely paid. Each
International Plan has been established, maintained and operated in all
material respects in accordance with their terms and all applicable Law
including, without limitation, any Law relating to exemption from Tax for any
International Plan intended to be Tax-exempt. There are no pending,
threatened or anticipated proceedings (other than routine claims for
benefits) involving any of the International Plans.   3.21 No Finder. None
of the CK Companies or any party acting on their behalf, has paid or become
obligated to pay any fee or commission to any broker, finder or intermediary

Reports. PVH has timely filed all forms, reports and documents required to be
filed by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission since February 4,
2001 (the "SEC Reports"). The SEC Reports (i) were prepared in all material
respects in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not at the time they
were filed contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Each of the balance sheets (including the related
notes) included in the SEC Reports presents fairly in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of PVH as of the respective dates
thereof, and the    31   other related financial statements (including
the related notes) included therein presented fairly in all material respects
the consolidated results of operations and changes in financial position of
PVH for the respective periods indicated, except, in the case of interim
financial statements, for year-end audit adjustments, consisting only of
normal recurring accruals. Each of the financial statements (including the
related notes) included in the SEC Reports has been prepared in accordance
with GAAP, except as otherwise noted therein or, in the case of the unaudited
financial statements, as permitted by the applicable rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission.   4.8 Private Offering. Subject to
the accuracy of the Sellers\' representations and warranties contained in
Article II, the offer, sale and issuance of the PVH Shares, the Warrant and
the shares of PVH Common Stock underlying the Warrant, as contemplated hereby
and by the Warrant, is (and will be) exempt from the registration

securities by any form of general solicitation or general advertising, as
such terms are used in Rule 502(c) under the Securities Act.   4.9
Capitalization. The PVH Disclosure Schedule sets forth, in each case as of
the date hereof, (i) the authorized Capital Stock of PVH, the number
of shares of each class of Capital Stock issued and outstanding and the
number of shares of PVH Common Stock reserved for issuance in connection with
PVH\'s stock option plans, and (ii) all options, warrants, rights to
subscribe to, calls, contracts, undertakings, arrangements and commitments to
issue which may result in the issuance of Capital Stock of PVH, other than
(x) options to purchase 615,887, 1,886,878 and 2,387,564 shares of PVH Common
Stock issued and outstanding under PVH\'s 1987, 1997 and 2000 stock option
plans, respectively, and (y) the Rights. All of the issued and outstanding
shares of PVH\'s Capital Stock have been duly and validly authorized and
issued and are fully paid and non-assessable and are not subject to any
preemptive rights. Except pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with
stock option plans, the Rights Agreement and the Apax Transaction, (i) no
equity securities of PVH are or may be required to be issued by reason of any
options, warrants, rights to subscribe to, calls or commitments of any
character whatsoever, (ii) there are outstanding no securities or rights
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of any Capital Stock of PVH, and
(iii) there are no contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by
which PVH is bound to issue additional shares of its Capital Stock or
securities or rights convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
any Capital Stock of PVH, or options, warrants or rights to purchase or
acquire any additional shares of its Capital Stock. Neither PVH nor any of
its Subsidiaries are subject to any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to
repurchase or otherwise acquire or retire any of its Capital Stock. Except as
contemplated by the Registration Rights Agreement, there are no contracts
between PVH and any Person granting such Person the right to require PVH to
file a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to any
securities of PVH owned or to be owned by such Person or to require PVH to
include such securities in any other registration statement filed by PVH
under the Securities Act.   4.10 Listing. PVH is not in violation of the
listing requirements of the NYSE in any material respect. PVH has not
received any written notice from the NYSE that the PVH Common Stock is to be
delisted by the NYSE.    32    4.11 Financial Statements. PVH has made
available to the Sellers copies of (i) the consolidated balance sheet of PVH
and its Subsidiaries as of February 3, 2002 and February 4, 2001 and the
related consolidated income statements, changes in stockholders\' equity and
cash flows for the fiscal years ended February 3, 2002, February 4, 2001 and
January 30, 2000, as reported in PVH\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended February 3, 2002, filed by PVH with the SEC under the
Exchange Act, and accompanied by the audit report of Ernst and Young LLP,
independent public accountants, and (ii) the unaudited consolidated balance
sheet of PVH and its Subsidiaries as of November 3, 2002 (the "PVH Balance
Sheet") and the related unaudited consolidated income statements and cash
flows for the thirteen weeks and thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2002, as
reported in PVH\'s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period
ended November 3, 2002, filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Such
audited financial statements accurately reflect the books and records of PVH
and present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of PVH and its Subsidiaries and the consolidated results
of their operations and their cash flows for the periods and dates covered
thereby, in conformity with GAAP. Such unaudited financial statements
accurately reflect the books and records of PVH and present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of PVH and its
Subsidiaries and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash
flows for the period and date covered thereby, in conformity with GAAP,
except for changes resulting from year-end adjustments (none of which will be
material in amount) and the absence of footnote disclosures thereto. PVH and
its Subsidiaries have no liabilities or obligations of a type that GAAP would
require to be on the PVH Balance Sheet (absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise) which are not fully reflected or reserved against in the PVH
Balance Sheet in conformity with GAAP, except for liabilities and obligations
that may have arisen in the ordinary and usual course of business and
consistent with past practice since November 3, 2002 and that, individually
or in the aggregate, could not reasonably have a PVH Material Adverse Effect.
Neither PVH nor any of its Subsidiaries are currently a party to any Off-
Balance Sheet Arrangement, which is not reflected in the financial statements
(or the footnotes thereto) referred to in this Section 4.11. During the past
three years, PVH has not restated any of its published financial results and
PVH is not aware of any facts which may require such restatement.   4.12 Tax
Matters.   (a) For the periods commencing after January 1, 1999, PVH and
each of its Subsidiaries has timely filed or caused to be timely filed any
and all Tax Returns required to be filed by it under applicable Law, except
to the extent that any failure to do so could not reasonably be likely to
have a PVH Material Adverse Effect. The reserves for Taxes contained in the
financial statements of PVH or carried on the books and records of PVH and
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, are in the aggregate adequate to cover all
Tax liabilities and deferred Taxes of PVH and its Subsidiaries, as of the
date of this Agreement, except to the extent that any inadequacy could not
have a PVH Material Adverse Effect.   (b) For the periods commencing after
January 1, 1999, all Taxes shown as being due and owing by PVH or any of its
Subsidiaries on any Tax Return have been paid.    33    (c) PVH and
each of its Subsidiaries have timely withheld and paid all Taxes required to
have been withheld and paid in connection with any amounts paid or owing to
any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or third party,
except to the extent that any failure to do so could not have a PVH Material
Adverse Effect.   (d) None of PVH nor any of its Subsidiaries have waived
any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of
time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, in each case except as
to Taxes that are disclosed in the PVH Disclosure Schedules or in the
financial statements of PVH and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, or that, if
assessed could not have a PVH Material Adverse Effect.   (e) PVH has not
been a "United States real property holding corporation" within the meaning
of Section 897 of the Code during the applicable period specified in Section
897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.   4.13 Intellectual Property.   (a) For the
purposes of this Section 4.13, "PVH Intellectual Property" shall mean (i) all
PVH Marks, trade dress, logos, trade names, domain names, web-sites, brand
names and corporate names (and all licenses or other rights relating to any
of the foregoing), together with all goodwill associated therewith, and all
applications, registrations and renewals in connection therewith, (ii) all
inventions and designs (whether patentable or unpatentable and whether or not
reduced to practice), all improvements thereto, and all patents, patent
applications, and patent disclosures, together with all reissuances,
continuations, continuations-in-part, revisions, extensions
and reexaminations thereof, and (iii) all copyrightable works, all copyrights
and all applications, registrations and renewals in connection therewith, in
each case which is owned by or licensed to PVH and its Subsidiaries as of the
date hereof.   (b) Each of PVH and its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to
use, all PVH Intellectual Property material to its business, and to the
knowledge of PVH, the use thereof by PVH and its Subsidiaries does not
infringe upon the trademark, copyright or proprietary rights of any other
Person, except for any such infringements that, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be likely to have a PVH Material Adverse
Effect.   (c) Except as set forth in the PVH Disclosure Schedules, no PVH
Mark licensed to or used by PVH or any of its Subsidiaries is scheduled to
expire (without the right of extension on the part of PVH) within 12 months
from the date hereof, which such expiration could reasonably be likely to
have a PVH Material Adverse Effect.   4.14 Employee Plans.   (a) The PVH
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and correct list of every Employee
Program which is maintained, administered, sponsored or contributed to by PVH
or any of its Subsidiaries, which covers any employee of PVH or any of its
Subsidiaries or with respect to which an obligation of PVH or any of its
Subsidiaries to make any contribution exists, other than a Foreign Plan. Any
Employee Program listed in such schedule (other than any   
34   Employee Program that is a multiemployer plan, as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer Plan")) is referred to below as a "Company
Employee Plan."   (b) PVH has made available to the Sellers with respect to
each Company Employee Plan complete and correct copies of (i) all written
documents comprising such Company Employee Plan (including amendments,
individual agreements, service agreements, trusts and other funding
agreements), (ii) the three most recent annual returns in the Federal Form
5500 series (including all schedules thereto) filed with respect to such
Company Employee Plan, (iii) the three most recent audited financial
statements and actuarial reports, if any, pertaining to such Company Employee
Plan, (iv) the summary plan description currently in effect and all material
modifications thereto, if any, for such Company Employee Plan, (v) any
employee handbook which includes a description of such Company Employee Plan,
(vi) the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination letter, if any,
for such Company Employee Plan, and (vii) any other written communications to
any employee, to the extent that the provisions of such Company Employee Plan
described therein differ materially from such provisions as set forth or
described in the other information or materials furnished under this
subsection (b).   (c) Each Company Employee Plan which is intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service which states that such plan is so
qualified, and on which any employer which has adopted such plan may
currently rely.   (d) Each Company Employee Plan and Foreign Plan has been
maintained in accordance with its terms and with all applicable Laws, except
to such extent as could not reasonably have a PVH Material Adverse Effect.
Neither PVH nor any of its Subsidiaries has any unsatisfied liability, or any
unpaid fine, penalty or tax, with respect to any Company Employee Plan, any
Foreign Plan or any other Employee Program, which could reasonably have a PVH
Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of PVH, there has been no
"prohibited transaction" (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code), or any breach of any duty under ERISA, any other
applicable Law or any agreement, with respect to any Company Employee Plan or
Foreign Plan which could subject PVH or any of its Subsidiaries to material
liability either directly or indirectly (including, without limitation,
through any obligation of indemnification or contribution) for any damages,
penalties, taxes or any other loss or expense which could reasonably have a
PVH Material Adverse Effect. PVH and each of its Subsidiaries has made full
and timely payment of all contributions required to be made by it to each
Company Employee Plan and Foreign Plan by the terms of any such plan or under
the applicable Law, except that all contributions which are so required to be
made by PVH or any of its Subsidiaries to each Company Employee Plan
and Foreign Plan for any period ending prior to the Closing, but which are
not due by the date of the Closing, shall be properly reserved or accrued in
the appropriate financial statements. There have been no material violations
of any reporting or disclosure requirements under ERISA or the Code with
respect to any Company Employee Plan, including any requirement to file an
annual return.   (e) No litigation or claim (other than routine claims for
benefits), and no governmental administrative proceeding, audit or
investigation, is pending or, to the knowledge    35   of PVH or any of
its Subsidiaries, threatened with respect to any Company Employee Plan or
Foreign Plan which could reasonably have a PVH Material Adverse Effect.  
(f) With respect to each Company Employee Plan which is a defined
benefit pension plan, (i) such Company Employee Plan has not incurred an
"accumulated funding deficiency", within the meaning of Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived, (ii) such Company
Employee Plan has not been terminated, (iii) no notice of intent to terminate
such Company Employee Plan has been issued to participants or filed with the
PBGC, (iv) the PBGC has not instituted any proceeding to terminate, or to
appoint a trustee or administrator of, such Company Employee Plan, and no
circumstances exist that are reasonably likely to constitute grounds under
Section 4042 of ERISA which may allow the PBGC to institute any such
proceeding, (v) except as set forth on the PVH Disclosure Schedule, if such
Company Employee Plan is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the meaning
of Section 401(a) of the Code, as of the most recent valuation date for such
Company Employee Plan, the present value of benefit liabilities, when
computed on a termination basis using actuarial assumptions which are
reasonable under the circumstances, does not exceed the value of assets, (vi)
neither PVH nor any of its Subsidiaries (x) have incurred any liability to
the PBGC or any other Person, or has become subject to any lien, under Title
IV of ERISA in connection with such Company Employee Plan (other than PBGC
premiums), or (y) has knowledge of any facts or transactions that might
reasonably be anticipated to result in the imposition of any liability on, or
the imposition of any lien on the assets of, PVH or any of its Subsidiaries
to, or in favor of, the PBGC or any other Person under Title IV of ERISA in
connection with such Company Employee Plan (other than PBGC premiums), and
(vii) no reportable event as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA and
the regulations issued under such section, excluding, however, such events as
to which the PBGC has by regulation waived the requirement of Section 4043 of
ERISA that it be notified within 30 days of the occurrence of such event, has
occurred with respect to such Company Employee Plan.   (g) Except as set
forth on the PVH Disclosure Schedule, no Employee Program which has been
maintained, administered or contributed to by PVH or any of its Subsidiaries,
which has covered any employee of PVH or any of its Subsidiaries, or to which
PVH or any of its Subsidiaries has had any obligation to make a contribution,
during the six-year period ending on the date of this Agreement, is (i) a
"multiemployer plan", as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, (ii) a "multiple
employer plan", as described in Section 413(c) of the Code, (iii) a "multiple
employer welfare arrangement", as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA, (iv) a
"voluntary employees\' beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section
501(c)(9) of the Code, or (v) a Foreign Plan other than a plan which does not
provide benefits materially greater than any benefits which may be required
by applicable Law. Neither PVH nor any of its Subsidiaries has, within the
past six years, incurred any withdrawal liability to a Multiemployer Plan.  
(h) Except as set forth on the PVH Disclosure Schedule, all health
and medical benefit coverage, and all death benefit coverage, under each
Company Employee Plan is provided solely through insurance, and no Company
Employee Plan provides health or medical coverage, life insurance coverage,
or coverage for any other welfare benefit to any retiree, except   
36   for continuation coverage required by Section 4980B of the Code,
Sections 601 to 608 of ERISA or any applicable State Law.   (i) No employee
of PVH or any of its Subsidiaries shall accrue or receive additional
benefits, additional credit for service, accelerated vesting or accelerated
rights to payment of any benefit under any Company Employee Plan, or become
entitled to any severance, termination allowance or similar payments or to
the forgiveness of any indebtedness, solely as a result of the execution
and delivery of, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Such
execution and delivery, or the occurrence of such transactions, shall not
result in any increase in the contributions required to be made to any
Company Employee Plan. Except as set forth on the PVH Disclosure Schedule, no
payment made or contemplated under any Company Employee Plan, or by PVH or
any of its Subsidiaries, in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the Apax Transaction, constituted, or would constitute, either
(i) an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code or (ii) a payment which is not deductible by reason of Section 404 of
the Code.   (j) Except as set forth on the PVH Disclosure Schedule, (i)
except for the adoption of a plan amendment which is needed to bring the plan
documents into conformity with statutory changes enacted in recent years,
neither PVH nor any of its Subsidiaries are under any obligation (express or
implied) to modify any Company Employee Plan, or to establish any new
Employee Program which will cover any employee of PVH or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) PVH or its Subsidiaries have expressly reserved to itself
the right to amend, modify or terminate each Company Employee Plan (and any
service or funding agreement or arrangement for each Company Employee Plan),
at any time without material liability or penalty to itself (other than
routine expenses), and (iii) no Company Employee Plan requires PVH or any of
its Subsidiaries to continue to employ or use the services of any
employee.   (k) Except as set forth on the PVH Disclosure Schedule, there

increase the expense of maintaining such plan above the level of expense
incurred with respect to that plan, as indicated in the applicable financial
statements, for its most recent fiscal year.   (l) No entity, which at any
time during the six-year period ending on the date of this Agreement has been

respects with all conditions of such Permits applicable to it.   4.16

on, stored on or under, released from, treated on, transported to or from, or
disposed of on or from, any property owned or during the period of PVH\'s or
any of its Subsidiaries\' lease(s), or, to the knowledge of PVH without any
investigation, any prior period, leased by PVH or any of its Subsidiaries
such that, under applicable Environmental Laws (i) any such Hazardous
Material would be required to be removed, cleaned-up or remediated before the
property could be altered, renovated, demolished or transferred, or (ii) the
owner or lessee of the property could be subjected to liability for the
removal, clean-up or remediation of such Hazardous Material, except, under
circumstances that could not reasonably be likely to have a PVH Material
Adverse Effect; and, except as set forth in the PVH Disclosure Schedules, PVH
has not received any written notification from any Governmental Authority or
other third parties relating to Hazardous Material on or affecting any
property owned or leased by PVH or its Subsidiaries or relating to any
potential or known liability under applicable Environmental Laws arising from
the ownership or leasing of any property, which could reasonably be likely to
have a PVH Material Adverse Effect.   4.17 No Finder. Except for the
engagement of The Blackstone Group L.P., JPMorgan Chase and Lehman Brothers,
neither PVH nor any party acting on its behalf has paid or become obligated
to pay any fee or commission to any broker, finder or intermediary for or on
account of the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Related
Agreements.   4.18 No Reliance. PVH acknowledges that no written or

THE PARTIES   6.1 Cooperation in Litigation; Retention of Employees   (a)
Prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date, the Sellers shall provide
to PVH (at PVH\'s sole cost and expense) such cooperation as may reasonably
be requested (taking into account the business and personal activities of the
Sellers) in connection with the defense of any litigation relating to any CK
Company whether existing on the Closing Date or arising thereafter out of, or
relating to, an occurrence or event happening before the Closing Date,
provided, that such cooperation is limited to matters of which the Sellers
have Knowledge.   (b) From and after the date hereof until the Closing, the
Sellers agree to use their reasonable best efforts (at PVH\'s sole cost and
expense which shall not include the payment by PVH of any obligations of any
CK Company for periods prior to Closing) to assist PVH in retaining,
subsequent to the Closing Date, the services of the employees of the CK
Companies whom PVH wishes to employ.   6.2 Employees.   (a) Any "Severance
Qualified Employee" (as hereinafter defined) whose employment with PVH or any
CK Company is involuntarily terminated without cause (as determined in good
faith by PVH) by PVH or any CK Company during the nine-month period beginning
on the Closing Date will be entitled to be paid severance by PVH or such CK
Company as follows:   (i) With respect to any such Severance Qualified
Employee who, as of  the employment termination in question, has more than 15
full years of  service with a CK Company (taking into account such Severance
Qualified  Employee\'s service with PVH or a CK Company after the Closing),
such  severance will be based on two weeks of such Severance Qualified
Employee\'s  salary for each full year of such Severance Qualified
Employee\'s service  with a CK Company (taking into account such Severance
Qualified    44    Employee\'s service with PVH or a CK Company after
the Closing), up to a  maximum severance payment equal to one year\'s salary;
and   (ii) With respect to any such Severance Qualified Employee who is
not  described in Section 6.2(a)(i) above, such severance will be based on
one  week of such Severance Qualified Employee\'s salary for each full year
of  such Severance Qualified Employee\'s service with a CK Company (taking
into  account such Severance Qualified Employee\'s service with PVH or a CK 
Company after the Closing), up to a maximum severance payment equal to one 
year\'s salary.  Payment of severance pay, if any, to any individual who is
not a Severance Qualified Employee and with respect to employment
terminations occurring after the expiration of the nine-month period
beginning on the Closing Date will be made in accordance with the then-
generally applicable policies of PVH. Any severance payments made hereunder
shall be net of withholding and other Taxes required under applicable Law.
For purposes hereof, a "Severance Qualified Employee" is any individual,
other than an International Employee, who was an employee of any CK Company
immediately prior to the Closing, who, prior to the employment termination in
question, was continuously employed by a CK Company (taking into account such
employee\'s service with PVH or a CK Company after the Closing) for at least
one full year and who, as of the employment termination in question, is not
covered by a written agreement that provides such Severance Qualified
Employee with a severance benefit. The amount of severance, if any, payable
to International Employees whose employment terminates after the
Closing shall be determined by PVH in accordance with its then-generally
applicable policies and applicable Law.   (b) PVH agrees that each
individual who was an employee of the CK Companies immediately prior to the
Closing will receive service credit for all periods of employment with the CK
Companies or any predecessor thereto prior to the Closing Date for purposes
of eligibility and vesting under any employee plan within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of ERISA in which such employee participates after the Closing
Date (but specifically excluding credit for benefit accrual purposes) and
vacation entitlement.   (c) With respect to any plan maintained by the CK
Companies, PVH or any Affiliate at or following the Closing Date that
provides welfare benefits to employees of the CK Companies, with respect to
such employees:   (i) Any pre-existing condition limitations with respect to
any  employee of the CK Companies shall be waived to the extent the condition
of  such employees would have been covered under the plan of the CK
Companies  in which such employee participated immediately prior to the
Closing Date;  and   (ii) Such employee will be provided with credit for
any co-payments  and deductible paid prior to the Closing Date and during the
calendar year  in which the Closing occurs under a CK Companies plan in
satisfying any  applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements for such
calendar year  under any welfare benefit plan in which such employee may be
eligible to  participate after the Closing Date.    45    (d)
Immediately prior to the Closing, the CK Companies shall terminate the Calvin
Klein, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan (the "CKI Plan"), effective as
of immediately prior to the Closing. Each individual who was an employee of
the CK Companies immediately prior to the Closing and who satisfies the
requirements for eligibility in either the PVH Associates Investment Plan for
Salaried Associates or the PVH Associates Investment Plan for Hourly
Associates (each a "PVH Savings Plan"), taking into account service credited
pursuant to Section 6.2(b) above, shall be eligible to participate in the
applicable PVH Savings Plan immediately following the Closing. Immediately
prior to the Closing, PVH and the Sellers shall cooperate and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) prevent any loan to a participant
under the CKI Plan that is outstanding as of the termination of the CKI Plan
from accelerating solely on account of such termination of the CKI Plan, and
(ii) obtain any participant consents and adopt any amendments to the CKI Plan
necessary to prevent such acceleration. As soon as practicable following the
Closing, PVH and the Sellers shall cooperate to communicate such termination
of the CKI Plan and such eligibility under the applicable PVH Savings Plan to
affected employees.   (e) Immediately prior to the Closing, the Sellers
shall take all reasonable steps to terminate the participation of any
individual who, immediately prior to the Closing, is not an employee of any
of the CK Companies or an eligible dependent of such an employee in any
Employee Benefit Plan maintained by any of the CK Companies and such
termination of participation shall not be a "qualifying event" within the
meaning of Section 4980B of the Code.   (f) Following the Closing, each of
Mr. Klein and Mr. Schwartz, will be entitled under "COBRA" to continue their
current group health plan coverage for a period of up to 18 months;
continuation of such coverage shall be at Mr. Klein\'s and Mr. Schwartz\'s
respective sole discretion and at their sole cost.   6.3 Non-Competition,
Non-Solicitation, Non-Derogation and Confidentiality.   (a) From and after
the Closing Date (until the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date with
respect to Mr. Schwartz), each of Mr. Klein and Mr. Schwartz agrees
individually on his own behalf that he will not, directly or
indirectly (including, without limitation, through any other Seller), engage
in, be employed by, be a consultant to, own, manage, operate, provide
financing to, control or participate in the ownership, management or control
of, or otherwise have an interest in any other Person in the conduct of, any

ownership of (i) the PVH Shares, the Warrant or the shares underlying the
Warrant, as applicable, (ii) less than 5% of the issued and outstanding stock
or other securities of a corporation listed on a national securities
exchange, electronic quotation and trading system or traded in the over-the-
counter market, and (iii) 10% or less in a fund or similar investment
vehicle, as a passive investor, provided, further that, if PVH has breached
its obligations under Section 1.5(a), and such breach continues for 60 days
or more after a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction relating to such breach, Mr. Klein shall not be restricted by
the provisions of this Section 6.3. For purposes of this Section 6.3,

any activity that is incidental to the equine business including, horse
breeding and horse racing or any other business in which he engages that is
not a Restricted Business (e.g., selling NYRA t-shirts), and (y) with respect
to Mr. Klein, engaging in any activity that is incidental to any other
business in which he engages that is not a Restricted Business (e.g. selling
t-shirts at a restaurant bearing the name of the restaurant). In no event
shall any agreement contained in this Section 6.3 modify the rights and
obligations of Mr. Klein and PVH contained in the Agreement and Assignment.
No Seller shall be in violation of this Section 6.3(a) if the action of such
Seller would otherwise be permitted by another subparagraph of this Section
6.3 or under the Agreement and Assignment.   (b) From and after the Closing
Date, until the third anniversary of the Closing Date, each of Mr. Klein and
Mr. Schwartz agrees individually on his own behalf that he will not, without
the prior written consent of PVH, directly or indirectly, for or on behalf of
himself or any other Person, employ or solicit for employment any officer or
executive or key employee of PVH or of any CK Company (other than those staff
members listed in Section 6.3(b) of the CK Companies Disclosure Schedule) at
the time of such solicitation or hiring or during the immediately preceding
six-month period or cause or seek to cause any such individual to leave the
employ of PVH or any CK Company, provided, that this Section 6.3(b) will not
be deemed to apply to a general solicitation to the public.   (c) (i) Each
Seller agrees that such Seller shall not make any public comment with the
intent to hurt or disparage the Marks or make any public comment with the
intent to hurt, disparage or be derogatory of PVH or any of its Affiliates
known to such Seller and those individuals known to such Seller to be its
officers, directors and key employees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
in this Agreement shall prevent Sellers from (A) making public statements
including complimentary statements about third parties and their goods and
services in the Restricted Business, or (B) providing general commentary,
opinions or interviews regarding any goods or services of a Restricted
Business, so long as such commentary, opinions or interviews are not intended
to (x) provide any comparison with the goods or services Bearing a Mark that
is adverse to such goods or services Bearing a Mark, or (y) be negative about
any goods or services marked under the Marks or (C) making any
comments otherwise restricted by this Section 6.3(c) that are specifically
related to asserting his or their claims filed in a court of law or with
another body exercising arbitration or similar quasi-judicial authority or
power or defending itself against claims made by PVH or any of its
Affiliates.   (ii) PVH shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
issue or make any public comment with the intent to hurt or to be disparaging
or derogatory to a Seller or any member of his or her immediate family or any
of their respective affiliates known to PVH to be affiliates of such Seller.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent PVH or
its Affiliates from making any such comments that are specifically related to
asserting their claims or defending themselves against claims filed in a
court of law or with another body exercising arbitration or similar quasi-
judicial authority or power or defending itself against claims made by a
Seller.    47    (d) Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the
covenants and agreements contained in this Section 6.3 have been negotiated
in good faith by each of them and reflect the fame, prestige and geographic
coverage of the businesses operated by the CK Companies and their licensees
and distributors, as well as the fame and prestige of the Sellers. Each
Seller further acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and agreements
contained in this Section 6.3 are reasonable and not more restrictive or
broader than necessary to protect the interests of PVH in purchasing the CK
Companies and would not achieve their intended purpose if they were on
different terms or for shorter periods of time or applied in more restrictive
geographical and business line areas than are provided herein. If any one or
more of the provisions contained in this Section 6.3 shall be held to be
excessively broad as to scope, territory or period of time, such provisions
shall be construed by limiting and reducing them so as to be enforceable to
the maximum extent allowed by applicable Law.   (e) Each Seller agrees to
hold confidential in accordance with commercial business practice all
Confidential Information obtained in the course of its ownership of shares or
participation in the management of any CK Company or otherwise which is
either non-public, confidential or proprietary in nature.   (f) Each Seller
agrees that PVH shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including
injunction and specific performance, in the event of any breach of
the provisions of this Section 6.3. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be
the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Section 6.3 by any Seller but
shall be in addition to all other remedies available at Law or equity
(subject to the provisions of Article IX). It is further understood and
agreed that failure or delay by PVH in exercising any right, power or
privilege under this Section 6.3 shall not operate as a waiver thereof nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise of any right, power or privilege under this Agreement. Each Seller
hereby waives any requirement that PVH post a bond in connection with any
claim for equitable relief.   6.4 Tax Matters.   (a) The Sellers shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed in a timely
manner all Tax Returns for the CK Companies and the CK Trust for all periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Periods"). Any such
Tax Returns filed between the date hereof and the Closing Date for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be prepared, and each item thereon treated, in a
manner consistent with past practices (including, without limitation, prior
Tax elections and accounting methods or conventions made or utilized by the
CK Companies and the CK Trust), except as required by a change in the
applicable Law.   (b) PVH shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the CK Companies and the CK Trust for
all periods beginning before and ending after the Closing Date ("Straddle
Periods") which are filed after the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns with
respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods with respect to which the Sellers have
agreed to indemnify PVH pursuant to Section 9.2 shall be prepared and filed
in a manner that is consistent with past practices (including, without
limitation, prior Tax elections and accounting methods or conventions made or
utilized by the CK Companies and the CK Trust), except (i) as is due to the
termination of the Subchapter S status (or analogous status under state or
local Law) of the CK    48   Companies in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) as required by a change in the
applicable Law. PVH shall submit such Tax Returns to the Sellers\'
Representative for review and comment at least 30 days prior to filing.
However, if the Sellers\' Representative disputes any item on such
Tax Return, it shall promptly notify PVH of such disputed item (or items) and
the basis for its objection. The parties shall act in good faith to resolve
any such dispute prior to the date on which the Tax Return is required to be
filed. If the parties cannot resolve any disputed item, the item in question
shall be resolved by an independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to
the Sellers and PVH. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be
borne equally by the Sellers and PVH. All disputes must be resolved prior to
the date on which the Tax Return is required to be filed and the parties
shall resolve all disputes (in the manner described herein) and the
applicable CK Company (or the CK Trust) shall sign and file the Tax Return on
or before the last day on which such Tax Return is required to be filed.  
(c) The Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid when due and payable
all unreserved Taxes of each of the CK Companies and the CK Trust, to the
extent allocable to any of the CK Companies, for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
and any pre-Closing portion of a Straddle Period; and (ii) PVH shall so pay
or cause to be paid such Taxes for any Tax periods commencing on or after the
Closing Date and any post-Closing portion of a Straddle Period. If the
aggregate reserves for accrued and unpaid Taxes of the CK Companies for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period and any pre-Closing portion of a Straddle Period
exceeds the aggregate Taxes shown on the applicable Tax Returns later filed
for such periods, then PVH shall pay such excess to the Sellers, but only to
the extent that such Tax reserves were reflected as liabilities or otherwise
reduced the Closing Date Net Book Value.   (d) PVH and the Sellers agree to
furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance relating to each CK Company and
the CK Trust (including, without limitation, access to books and records,
employees, contractors and representatives) as is reasonably necessary for
the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any election related to Taxes,
the preparation for and conduct of any audit by any Tax Authority, and the
prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax
Return. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of
relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying
schedules, related work papers and documents relating to rulings or other
determinations by Tax Authorities at the sole cost of the requesting party.
If reasonably requested by PVH, the Sellers\' Representative shall
make himself available on a basis mutually convenient to both parties to
provide explanations of any documents or information provided hereunder. PVH
and the Sellers shall retain all books and records with respect to Taxes
pertaining to the CK Companies and the CK Trust in their respective
possession (which shall include, in the case of PVH, books and records in the
possession of the CK Companies) until the later of (i) the expiration of the
statute of limitations of the Tax periods to which such Tax Returns and other
documents relate, without regard to extensions except to the extent notified
by the other party in writing of such extensions for the respective Tax
periods prior to such expirations, and (ii) six years following the due date
(without extension) for such Tax Returns. At the end of such period, each
party shall provide the others with at least ten days\' prior written notice
before destroying any such books and records, during which period the parties
receiving such notice can elect to take possession, at their own expense, of
such books and records. PVH and the Sellers shall cooperate with each other
in the    49   conduct of any audit or other proceeding related to Taxes
involving the CK Companies. Any information provided or obtained under this
Section 6.4 shall be kept confidential except as may be otherwise necessary
in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in conducting an audit or
other proceeding.   (e) As a result of the transfer of the Purchase Shares,
each of the CK Companies and the CK Trust shall be treated for federal income
Tax purposes as having two short years for Tax purposes during the calendar
year in which the Closing occurs pursuant to Section 1362(e)(1) of the Code:
(i) a period from January 1 of the calendar year in which the Closing occurs
through the end of the day prior to the Closing Date; and (ii) a period from
the beginning of the Closing Date through December 31 of the calendar year in
which the Closing occurs. Accordingly, each of the CK Companies and the CK
Trust shall close their books as of the Closing Date.   (f) The Sellers and
PVH agree that each will pay one-half of all applicable transfer Taxes, sales
and/or use Taxes, real property transfer or excise Taxes, recording, deed,
stamp and other similar Taxes, fees and duties under applicable Law incurred
in connection with the transfer of the Purchase Shares. The Sellers and PVH
agree to jointly prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to
be filed in a timely manner, all Tax Returns required to be filed with
respect to such Taxes.   (g) For all Tax purposes, PVH, the Sellers, and
the CK Companies agree that they will report the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement, and
all parties agree to file their Tax Returns accordingly.   (h) Mr. Klein
shall, and shall cause each holder, if any, of rights with respect to the
Design Services Purchase Payments (in either case, a "Rights Holder") to,
provide to PVH two properly completed and executed Internal Revenue Service
Forms W-9 or other applicable forms, certificates or documents prescribed by
the Internal Revenue Service of the United States certifying as to such
Rights Holder\'s entitlement to exemption from United States withholding
Tax and back-up withholding Tax with respect to the Design Services
Purchase Payments to be made to such Rights Holder hereunder ("Certificates
of Exemption"). Mr. Klein shall provide such Certificates of Exemption on or
before the Closing Date and thereafter as and when requested to do so by PVH.
Mr. Klein shall cause each Person that becomes a Rights Holder after the
Closing Date to provide Certificates of Exemption on or before the date such
Person becomes a Rights Holder and thereafter as and when requested to do so
by PVH. Mr. Klein agrees, and shall cause each Rights Holder to agree, to
provide PVH with new Certificates of Exemption (x) upon the obsolescence of
any letter, form, certificate or document previously delivered by such Rights
Holder to PVH hereunder or (y) promptly after the occurrence of any event
requiring a change in the status of the Rights Holder or in any of the other
information provided on the most recent letter, form, certificate or document
previously delivered by the Rights Holder to PVH hereunder. If PVH shall
provide written notice to a Rights Holder that new Certificates of Exemption
are required, and if the Rights Holder does not submit them within 30 days
following the receipt of such notice, then PVH shall be permitted to deduct
all applicable withholding Taxes from the payment due to such Rights
Holder.    40    6.5 Access. From and after the Closing Date, PVH shall
and shall cause the CK Companies to afford to the Sellers and their agents
reasonable access to their properties, books, records, employees and auditors
(during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior written notice) to
the extent necessary to permit the Sellers to determine any matter relating
to their rights and obligations hereunder or to any period ending on or
before the Closing Date; provided, that any such access by the Sellers or
their agents shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
business of PVH or the CK Companies.   6.6 Directors\' and Officers\'
Indemnification and Insurance. To the extent any director, officer or
employee of any of the CK Companies has the benefit of any right to
indemnification pursuant to the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or
similar organizational documents of any of the CK Companies or the CK Trust,
PVH agrees to continue such indemnification and not to amend, alter or waive
in any adverse respect any such indemnification for a period of not less than
six years following the Closing; provided, however, PVH shall not be required
to provide such indemnification for any liability or expense of
such director, officer or employee arising out of the willful malfeasance,
bad faith or fraud of any such director, officer or employee, or for any
liability or expense arising from any state of facts, event or condition for
which any PVH Group Member would be entitled to indemnification under Article
IX, disregarding any limitations set forth in Section 9.4 and the survival
periods set forth in Section 9.1. In addition, PVH will provide, or cause the
CK Companies to provide, for a period of not less than six years after the
Closing, each of the CK Companies\' current directors and officers an
insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring at or prior to the Closing that is no less favorable than the
existing policy pursuant to which such directors and officers are covered;
provided, however, that PVH and the CK Companies shall not be required to pay
an annual premium for such policy in excess of 200% of the annual premium
currently paid by the CK Companies for such insurance, but in such case shall
purchase as much of such coverage as possible for such amount.   6.7
Offices. PVH agrees that it will maintain and make available, at PVH\'s sole
cost and expense, to Mr. Klein and Mr. Schwartz, their existing office space
for the benefit of each of Mr. Klein and Mr. Schwartz on an as-needed basis
and for transition purposes for a period of up to 90 days following the
Closing.   6.8 Legend.   (a) The certificates evidencing the PVH Shares,
the Warrant and the shares of the PVH Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of the Warrant will bear a legend substantially similar to the following:  
"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT  BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS  AMENDED, OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY

Section 6.8(a) shall be removed and the Company shall issue a certificate

occur of (i) a registration statement with respect to the sale of such

allegation in writing by any third party of the existence of  any liability,

hereunder), provided, that for purposes of  this Section 9.2(b)(iii), with

prior to the Closing) contained in Article  III (as of the date of this

agreement, indemnification agreement, partnership or trust  agreement or

(viii) the notice from Union of Needletrades Industrial and Textile

ownership or operation of PVH, the CK Companies and the CK Trust with respect
to all periods and the allegation in writing by any third party of the
existence of any liability, obligation, lease, agreement, contract,
other commitment or state of facts which, if such allegation were true, would
give rise to indemnification under this Section 9.3(d); provided, however,
PVH shall not be required to provide such indemnification to the extent such
Damages are incurred as a result of a state of facts, event or condition for
which any PVH Group Member would be entitled to indemnification under this
Article IX, disregarding any limitations set forth in Section 9.4 and the
survival periods set forth in Section 9.1 or as a result of fraud by a Seller
Group Member.   9.4 Limitations on Indemnification.   (a) No PVH Group
Member shall be entitled to be indemnified pursuant to Sections 9.2(a)(ii) or
(iii), 9.2(b)(ii) or (iii), 9.2(c)(ii) or (iii), or for any breach of Section
5.2, as the case may be, unless and until the aggregate of all Damages
incurred by PVH Group Members shall exceed $5,000,000 (the "Basket"), and the
maximum aggregate amount of indemnification pursuant to Sections 9.2(a)(ii)
or (iii), 9.2(b)(ii) or (iii), 9.2(c)(ii) or (iii) or for breaches of Section
5.2 that may be received by PVH Group Members shall not exceed $100,000,000
(the "Cap"); provided, however, PVH Group Members shall be entitled to be
indemnified for all Damages on a dollar-for-dollar basis from the first
dollar of Damages, without regard to the Basket or the Cap, incurred as
a result of any breach of the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 2.1, 2.3, 3.1(b), 3.3, 3.6 or 3.15. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, nothing in this Section 9.4 shall limit
PVH\'s or CKI\'s (as constituted after the Closing) rights under the
Agreement and Assignment or the Consulting Agreement.   (b) The maximum
aggregate amount of indemnification for breaches of the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 4.9, 4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, 4.15 and
4.16 that may be received by Seller Group Members shall not exceed
$30,000,000.   (c) Without limitation to the foregoing, for purposes of
Sections 9.2(c)(ii) and 9.2(c)(iii), in determining the amount of any Damages
in connection with any inaccuracy of a representation and warranty (but not
for purposes of determining whether any such inaccuracy has occurred),
any materiality or CK Companies Material Adverse Effect qualifier in
such representation or warranty will be disregarded.   (d) Notwithstanding
the preamble to Article III, in no event will Mr. Klein or Mr. Schwartz be
liable for more than one-half of any Damages arising under Section 9.2(c).
PVH    59   agrees to proceed against Mr. Klein and Mr. Schwartz at the
same time in connection with any action arising under Section 9.2(c).   (e)
The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under this
Article IX shall be net of (i) any amount accrued or reserved for on
the Closing Date Balance Sheet in respect of Damages, and (ii) any
insurance proceeds available under any insurance policies as then in effect
to an Indemnitee hereunder in connection with the events or circumstances
giving rise to the indemnification, but only to the extent that the
Indemnitee actually receives any such insurance proceeds or any benefits
thereof and only in an amount not to exceed the amount of any such insurance
proceeds actually received by the Indemnitee. The Indemnitee will use
commercially reasonable efforts to claim and recover under such insurance
policies.   (f) The parties acknowledge and agree that after the Closing,
the indemnification provisions contained in Sections 9.2 and 9.3 shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy for Damages arising out of or caused by the breach
of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered in
connection herewith, except for any remedies that may be available under
Section 6.3, for a breach of Section 1.5, or with respect to claims arising
out of fraud.   9.5 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. It is the intention
of the parties to treat any indemnity payment made under this Agreement as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all federal, state, local and foreign
Tax purposes, and the parties agree to file their Tax Returns
accordingly.   9.6 Tax Refunds. PVH shall pay to Sellers or credit against
their indemnification obligations (if applicable), all refunds or credits of
Taxes received by PVH or any CK Company after the Closing Date and
attributable to Taxes paid by or on behalf of any CK Company (unless paid by
PVH) with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods net of any Taxes imposed on such
refund amount; provided, however, that the rights and obligations described
in this sentence shall not apply (i) if such refunds or credits of Taxes were
reflected as assets or otherwise increased the Closing Date Net Book Value,
(ii) to any net operating loss of any CK Company arising in any Pre-Closing
Tax Period that is utilized by PVH in any period beginning after the Closing
Date, or (iii) to any refund or credit that is attributable to the carry-back
of losses, deductions, or credits from a taxable period other than a Pre-
Closing Tax Period. The Sellers agree that they will promptly pay PVH the
amount of any refund or credit received by them that results from PVH\'s
carry-back of any losses or other Tax attributes to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.
Each such payment (which shall include any interest received or credited with
respect to such refund or credit) shall be made to the other party promptly
after receipt of any such refund from, or allowance of such credit by, the
relevant Tax Authority. The Sellers and PVH shall cooperate (at the sole cost
and expense of the party seeking the applicable refund or credit) in
obtaining any refund or credit of Taxes available from the relevant Tax
Authority. In the event that any refund or credit of Taxes for which a
payment has been made pursuant to this Section 9.6 is subsequently reduced or
disallowed, the party that ultimately received the benefit of the refund or
credit pursuant to this Section 9.6 shall promptly pay to the other party the
amount of any refund or credit that has been disallowed or the amount by
which such refund or credit has been    60   reduced and shall
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other parties for any Tax liability,
including interest and penalties, assessed against such indemnified person by
reason of the reduction or disallowance.   9.7 Notice of Claims. Any PVH
Group Member or Seller Group Member seeking indemnification hereunder (an
"Indemnitee") shall give to the party or parties obligated to provide
indemnification to such Indemnitee (an "Indemnitor") a notice ("Claim
Notice") describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim
for indemnification hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then
known) the amount or the method of computation of the amount of such claim,
and a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any other agreement,
document or instrument executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon
which such claim is based.   9.8 Third Party Claims. In the case of any
third party Action as to which indemnification is sought by an Indemnitee,
the Indemnitor shall have 15 Business Days after receipt of a Claim Notice to
notify the Indemnitee that it elects to conduct and control such Action. If
the Indemnitor elects to conduct and control such Action, the Indemnitor
shall agree promptly to reimburse the Indemnitee for the full amount of any
Damages resulting from such Action, except fees and expenses of counsel for
the Indemnitee incurred after the assumption of the conduct and control of
such Action by the Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor does not give the foregoing
notice, the Indemnitee shall have the right, at the sole expense of the
Indemnitor, to conduct and control such Action, provided, that (x) the
Indemnitee shall permit the Indemnitor to participate in such conduct
or settlement through counsel chosen by the Indemnitor, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitor, and (y) the
Indemnitee may not compromise or settle such Action without the consent of
the Indemnitor (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
unless (i) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law by the
Indemnitor or any violation by the Indemnitor of the rights of any Person and
no effect on any other claims that may be made against the Indemnitor, (ii)
the sole relief provided is monetary Damages that are paid in full by the
Indemnitee, (iii) the Indemnitor shall have no liability with respect to any
compromise or settlement and (iv) such settlement includes an unconditional
release in favor of the Indemnitor by the third-party claimant from all
liability with respect to such claim, or (v) the claim is solely for other
than money Damages which would not affect the business of the Indemnitor and
the Indemnitee waives any right to indemnification for any claim of the type
identified in this clause (v), other than with respect to reimbursement of
the reasonable fees and expenses incurred in the defense of such Action. If
the Indemnitor gives the foregoing notice, subject to the first and second
sentences of this Section 9.8, the Indemnitor shall have the right, at the
sole expense of the Indemnitor, to conduct and control, such Action with
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee, and the Indemnitee shall
cooperate with the Indemnitor in connection therewith, provided, that (x) the
Indemnitor shall permit the Indemnitee to participate in such conduct or
settlement through counsel chosen by the Indemnitee, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitee, and (y)
the Indemnitor may not compromise or settle any such Action without the
consent of the Indemnitee (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) unless (i) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law
by the Indemnitee or any violation by the Indemnitee of the rights of any
Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the
Indemnitee, (ii) the sole relief provided is money Damages that are paid in
full by the     61   Indemnitor, (iii) the Indemnitee shall have no
liability with respect to any compromise or settlement and (iv) such
settlement includes an unconditional release in favor of the Indemnitee by
the third-party claimant from all liability with respect to such claim. In
the case of any third party Action as to which indemnification is sought by
the Indemnitee which involves a claim for Damages other than solely for money
Damages which could have a continuing effect on the business of the
Indemnitee, the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor shall jointly control the
conduct of such Action. The parties hereto shall use their reasonable best
efforts to minimize any Damages from claims by third parties and shall act in
good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing
with such claims, notwithstanding any dispute as to liability under this
Article IX.   ARTICLE X.   TERMINATION   10.1 Termination. This
Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date:   (a) by
mutual consent of PVH and all of the Sellers; or   (b) by PVH, if there has

representations and warranties contained in this Agreement when taken as a
whole or (ii) a material violation by any CK Company or any Seller of any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, provided, that written
notice of such violation or breach shall have been given to such CK Company

been cured within ten days of receipt of such notice (provided,
further, that, to exercise its rights under this Section 10.1(b) for any
particular violation or breach, PVH must terminate this Agreement within 15
Business Days after the cure period provided for in this Section 10.1(b));
or   (c) by all of the Sellers, if there has been (i) a material breach by
PVH of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement when

violation or breach shall have been given to PVH and such violation or breach

(provided, further, that, to exercise their rights under this Section 10.1(c)
for any particular violation or breach, the Sellers must terminate this
Agreement within 15 Business Days after the end of the cure period provided

costs and expenses, except as provided in Section 11.1; provided, however,
that any termination of this Agreement under this Article X shall not relieve

waiver of any claim with respect thereto.   ARTICLE XI.

Schedules, Appendices and Exhibits hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement,
sets forth the entire agreement and understanding among the parties as to the
subject matter hereof and merges and supersedes all prior discussions,
agreements and understandings of every kind and nature among them with
respect to such subject matter.   11.5 Severability. If any provision of
this Agreement or the application of any provision hereof to any person or
circumstances is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement   
64   and the application of such provision to other persons or
circumstances shall not be affected unless the provision held invalid shall
substantially impair the benefits of the remaining portions of this
Agreement.   11.6 Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs,

may not be assigned by any Seller or any CK Company except with the prior
written consent of PVH; provided, however, Mr. Klein may assign all or part
of his rights to receive the Design Services Purchase Payments. PVH may
assign its rights, but not its obligations, under this Agreement to any
Affiliate of PVH so long as said Affiliate agrees in writing provided to the
Sellers that it will also be bound by and perform all obligations of PVH in
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVH may assign its rights
under Section 6.3 to any Person in connection with the sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of PVH or all or substantially all of the
assets comprising the business of the CK Companies (whether conducted
directly, or indirectly, by PVH) to such Person, so long as such Person

the Related Agreements.   11.7 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.   (a) This
Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of
the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed wholly
within said State, without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles
thereof.   (b) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of (i) the courts of the State of New York located in
New York County and (ii) the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, for the purposes of any Action arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.   (c) Notwithstanding
Sections 11.7(a) and (b), in the event of any dispute between PVH, on the one
hand, and any Seller, on the other hand, prior to the commencement of any
litigation proceeding, such parties may (but are not obligated to) select an
independent mediator to assist in the mediation and resolution of such
disputes. PVH and the Sellers with the assistance of such mediator, shall use
reasonable best efforts to mediate their disputes within 60 days after the
submission of the dispute to such mediator. If the parties are not able to
successfully mediate such disputes within such 60-day period, the parties
agree that the resolution of such dispute will be governed by
Sections 11.7(a) and (b). Unless provided otherwise in this Agreement, the
cost of such mediator shall be borne equally by the parties.   11.8
Specific Performance. The parties agree that if any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed by PVH, on the one hand, or the Sellers and the
CK Companies, on the other hand, in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached by such parties, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at Law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and that the non-breaching party will be entitled to specific
performance of the terms hereof. The parties waive any requirement for the
posting of a bond in connection with any Action seeking specific performance;
provided, however, that nothing    65   herein will affect the right of
any of the parties to seek recovery against any party hereto, at Law, in
equity or otherwise, with respect to any covenants, agreements or obligations
to be performed by such party or parties after the Closing Date.   11.9

hereof. Any reference in this Agreement (including in any Exhibit, Appendix
or Schedule hereto) to a "Section," "Article," or "Exhibit" shall mean a
Section, Article or Exhibit of or to this Agreement unless expressly
stated otherwise.   11.10 Interpretation. In this Agreement, (a) words used
herein regardless of the gender specifically used shall be deemed and
construed to include any other gender, masculine, feminine or neuter, as the
context shall require, and (b) all terms defined in the singular shall have
the same meanings when used in the plural and vice versa. Any statute defined
or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to
herein means such statute as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable
successor statutes. References to a Person are also its predecessors and
permitted successors and assigns.   11.11 Schedules. Any item that is
disclosed in any part of the CK Companies Disclosure Schedule, the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule or of the PVH Disclosure Schedule with sufficient
specificity so that it is apparent on the face of such Schedule that such
disclosure is also applicable to one or more other parts of such Schedule
shall also be deemed disclosed for purposes of such other parts of such
Schedule to which such disclosure is applicable. Terms used in any Schedule
to this Agreement and not otherwise defined in such Schedule shall have the

Except as expressly provided herein or as otherwise agreed by the parties
hereto, the provisions of this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the
parties hereto and shall not inure to the benefit of any third party.  
11.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
taken together shall constitute a single agreement. This Agreement will
become binding when one or more counterparts taken together will have been
