vii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 27, 2004 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and between Unizan Financial Corp., an Ohio corporation (" _Unizan_
"), and Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, a Maryland corporation ("
_Huntington_ ").



W I T N E S S E T H:



WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Unizan and Huntington have determined that
it is in the best interests of their respective companies and
their shareholders and stockholders to consummate the strategic business
combination transaction provided for in this Agreement in which Unizan will,
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge
with and into Huntington (the " _Merger_ "), so that Huntington is the
surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as
the " _Surviving Corporation_ "); and



WHEREAS, for Federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and
this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization"
for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and



WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, and other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as
follows:



ARTICLE I



THE MERGER



1.1 _The Merger_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
in accordance with the Ohio General Corporation Law (the " _OGCL_ ") and the
Maryland General Corporation Law (the " _MGCL_ "), at the Effective Time,
Unizan shall merge with and into Huntington. Huntington shall be the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under
the laws of the State of Maryland. As of the Effective Time, the
separate corporate existence of Unizan shall cease.



(b) Huntington may at any time change the method of effecting the combination
(including by providing for the merger of Unizan and a wholly owned subsidiary
of Huntington), and Unizan shall cooperate in such efforts, including by
entering into an appropriate amendment to this Agreement (to the extent such
amendment only changes the method of effecting the business combination and
does not substantively affect this Agreement or the rights and obligations of
the parties or their respective shareholders hereunder);  _provided_ ,  



 

1   _however_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or
kind of consideration to be issued to holders of the capital stock of Unizan
as provided for in this Agreement (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), (ii)
adversely affect the Tax treatment of Unizans shareholders as a result of
receiving the Merger Consideration or the Tax treatment of either party
pursuant to this Agreement or (iii) materially impede or delay consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") that shall be filed with
the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation and the certificate
of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") that shall be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Ohio on or before the Closing Date. The
term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes
effective as set forth in the Articles of Merger and the Certificate of
Merger. " _Effective Date_ " shall mean the date on which the Effective Time
occurs.



1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in Section 1701.72 of the OGCL and Section
3-114 of the MGCL.



1.4 _Conversion of Unizan Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Huntington, Unizan or the
holder of any of the following securities:



(a) Subject to  _Section 2.2(e)_ , each share of the common stock, without
par value, of Unizan issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (" _Unizan Common Stock_ "), except for shares of Unizan Common Stock
owned by Unizan or Huntington (other than shares of Unizan Common Stock held
in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a
fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties
(any such shares, " _Trust Account Common Shares_ ") and other than shares of
Unizan Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, by Unizan or Huntington in
respect of a debt previously contracted (any such shares, " _DPC Common
Shares_ ")) and for Dissenting Shares (as defined in _Section 1.10_ ), shall
be converted into the right to receive 1.1424 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_
") of common stock, without par value, of Huntington (together with the
preferred share purchase rights attached thereto issued pursuant to that
certain Rights Agreement (the " _Rights Agreement_ "), dated as of February
22, 1990, by and between Huntington and The Huntington National Bank, as
successor to The Huntington Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent, as amended,
" _Huntington Common Stock_ ").



(b) All of the shares of Unizan Common Stock converted into the right to
receive Huntington Common Stock (as defined in _Section 1.4(a)_ ) pursuant to
this _Article I_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and, subject
to _Section 1.10_ , each certificate previously representing any such shares
of Unizan Common Stock (each a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive (A) a certificate representing the number of whole
shares of Huntington Common Stock and (B) cash in lieu of fractional shares
into which the shares of Unizan Common Stock represented by such Certificate
have been converted pursuant to this _Section 1.4_ and _Section 2.2(e)_.
Certificates previously representing shares of Unizan Common Stock shall be
exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of Huntington Common
Stock and cash in  



 

2  lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such Certificates in accordance with _Section 2.2_ , without
any interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares
of Huntington Common Stock or Unizan Common Stock shall have been increased,
decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares
or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other
similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment
shall be made to the Exchange Ratio.

 



(c) Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, at
the Effective Time, all shares of Unizan Common Stock that are owned by
Unizan or Huntington (other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of Huntington or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.



1.5 _Huntington Common Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of
Huntington capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected
by the Merger.



1.6 _Unizan Stock Plans_. (a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each then
outstanding option to purchase shares of Unizan Common Stock (each a " _Unizan
Stock Option_ "), pursuant to the equity-based compensation plans identified
on _Schedule 3.11(a)_ (the " _Unizan Stock Plans_ "), granted to any current
or former employee or director of, or consultant to, Unizan or any of its
subsidiaries shall be assumed by Huntington and shall be converted into an
option to purchase a number of shares of Huntington Common Stock (rounded
to the nearest whole share) (an " _Assumed Stock Option_ ") equal to (i) the
number of shares of Unizan Common Stock subject to such Unizan Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio;
and the per share exercise price for Huntington Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise of such Assumed Stock Option shall be equal to (i) the exercise
price per share of Unizan Common Stock at which such Unizan Stock Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (ii) the
Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole cent); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the case of any Unizan Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code
applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the
conversion formula shall be adjusted, if necessary, to comply with Section
424(a) of the Code. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Assumed Stock
Options shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including
expiration date, vesting and exercise provisions) as were applicable to the
corresponding Unizan Stock Options immediately prior to the Effective Time.



(b) Huntington has taken all corporate actions necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Huntington Common Stock upon the
exercise of the Assumed Stock Options. On or as soon as practicable following
the Closing, Huntington shall file a registration statement on an appropriate
form or a post-effective amendment to a previously filed
registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the issuance
of the shares of Huntington Common Stock subject to the Assumed Stock Options
and shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such equity awards remain outstanding.



 

3 (c) Unizan shall take such action as is necessary to (i) cause the exercise
(as of a date that is no later than the earlier of the expiration of the
current purchase period and three business days prior to the Effective Date)
of each outstanding purchase right under the Unizan Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the " _Unizan ESPP_ "); (ii) provide that no further purchase period
shall commence under the Unizan ESPP following such date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such exercise and cessation of further purchase periods shall
be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger; (iii) provide that
participation in the Unizan ESPP shall be limited to those employees who were
participants on the date hereof; and (iv) provide that participants as of the
date hereof may not increase their payroll deduction election or
purchase elections from those in effect on the date hereof. On such new
exercise date, Unizan shall apply the funds credited as of such date under the
Unizan ESPP within each participants payroll withholding account to the
purchase of shares of Unizan Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the
Unizan ESPP. In addition, Unizan shall take such action as is necessary to
provide that as of no later than three business days prior to the Effective
Date no further shares of Unizan Common Stock will be purchased under the
Unizan Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the " _Unizan DRIP_ " and,
together with the Unizan ESPP, the " _Unizan Stock Purchase Plans_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that such cessation of further purchases shall be
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. Immediately prior to and
effective as of the Effective Time and subject to the consummation of the
Merger, Unizan shall terminate the Unizan Stock Purchase Plans. 



1.7 _Certificate of Incorporation of Huntington_. At the Effective Time, the
Huntington Charter (as defined in _Section 4.1(b)_ ) shall be the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable law.



1.8 _Bylaws of Huntington_. At the Effective Time, the Huntington
Bylaws shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with applicable law.



1.9 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.



1.10 _Dissenting Shares_. No outstanding shares of Unizan Common Stock as to
which rights have been asserted pursuant to Section 1701.75 of the OGCL and
duly perfected in accordance therewith and not effectively withdrawn ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall be converted into or represent a right to receive
the Huntington Common Stock in the Merger, and the holder thereof shall
be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the OGCL. Unizan shall give
Huntington (i) prompt notice upon receipt by Unizan of the assertion of any
such rights and of withdrawals thereof (any holder of such shares, a "
_Dissenting Shareholder_ ") and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or
notices. Unizan shall not, without the prior written consent of Huntington,
make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise
negotiate, any such demands. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall effectively
withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to such
payment, such holders shares of the Unizan Common Stock shall be converted
into a right to receive shares of Huntington Common Stock in accordance with
_Section 1.4(a)_ and the other applicable provisions of this Agreement.



 

4 ARTICLE II



EXCHANGE OF SHARES



2.1 _Huntington to Make Shares Available_. As promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time, Huntington shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with a bank or trust company Subsidiary of Huntington, or
another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to each of Unizan and
Huntington (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_ ,
certificates representing the shares of Huntington Common Stock, and cash in
lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and certificates for shares of
Huntington Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto, being referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "), to be issued
pursuant to _Section 1.4_ and paid pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ in exchange
for outstanding shares of Unizan Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares).



2.2 _Exchange of Shares_. (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of one or more
Certificates (except to the extent representing Dissenting Shares) a letter of
transmittal in customary form as prepared by Huntington and reasonably
acceptable to Unizan (which shall specify, among other things, that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing the shares of Huntington Common Stock
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of Unizan
Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate
or Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder
of such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, as applicable, (i) a certificate representing the number of whole
shares of Huntington Common Stock to which such holder of Unizan Common Stock
shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of _Article I_ , (ii) a
check representing the amount of any cash in lieu of fractional shares which
such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or
Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ , and
(iii) a check representing the amount of any dividends or distributions then
payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)(i)_ , and the Certificate or Certificates
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends
and distributions payable to holders of Certificates.



(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to
Huntington Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in
accordance with this _Article II_. After the surrender of a Certificate in
accordance with this _Article II_ , the record holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid, without any interest
thereon, with respect to the whole shares of Huntington Common Stock
represented by such Certificate and (ii), at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent
to surrender, with respect to shares of Huntington Common Stock represented
by such Certificate.



 

5 (c) If any certificate representing shares of Huntington Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition
to the issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
representing shares of Huntington Common Stock in any name other than that of
the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered, or
required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.



(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Unizan of the shares of Unizan Common Stock that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle
transfers of Unizan Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are
presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for certificates representing shares of Huntington Common Stock as
provided in this _Article II_.



(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Huntington Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no
dividend or distribution with respect to Huntington Common Stock shall be
payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of Huntington. In lieu of the issuance of any such
fractional share, Huntington shall pay to each former shareholder of Unizan
who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in
cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average
of the closing-sale prices of Huntington Common Stock on the Nasdaq National
Market (the " _Nasdaq_ ") as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five
full Nasdaq trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the date
on which the Effective Time occurs by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to
the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Huntington Common
Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section 1.4_.



(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Unizan as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall
be paid to Huntington. Any former shareholders of Unizan who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only
to Huntington for payment of the shares of Huntington Common Stock, cash in
lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on
the Huntington Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Unizan
Common Stock, as the case may be, such shareholder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Huntington, Unizan, the Exchange Agent
or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Unizan
Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.



 

6 (g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
Huntington, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Huntington
may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of
Huntington Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable
in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

(a) Section 3.11(a) of the Unizan Disclosure Schedule includes a complete list
of all material Unizan Benefit Plans and all Employment Agreements.



(b) With respect to each Plan, Unizan has delivered to Huntington a true,
correct and complete copy of: (i) each writing constituting a part of such
Plan, including without limitation all plan documents, employee
communications, benefit schedules, trust agreements, and insurance contracts
and other funding vehicles; (ii) the most recent Annual Report (Form 5500
Series) and accompanying schedule, if any; (iii) the current summary plan
description and any material modifications thereto, if any (in each case,
whether or not required to be furnished under ERISA); (iv) the most recent
annual financial report, if any; (v) the most recent actuarial report, if any;
and (vi) the most recent determination letter from the IRS, if any. Unizan has
delivered or made available to Huntington a true, correct and complete copy
of each Employment Agreement. Except as specifically provided in the foregoing
documents delivered to Huntington, there are no amendments to any Plan or
Employment Agreement that have been  



 

14  adopted or approved nor has Unizan or any of its Subsidiaries undertaken to
make any such amendments or to adopt or approve any new Plan or
Employment Agreement.



(c) All contributions required to be made to any Plan by applicable law or
regulation or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and all
premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any Plan,
for any period through the date hereof have been timely made or paid in full
or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date
hereof, have been fully reflected on the financial statements. Each Unizan
Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of
ERISA either (i) is funded through an insurance company contract and is not a
"welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code or (ii)
is unfunded.



 

(d) With respect to each Unizan Benefit Plan, Unizan and its Subsidiaries have
complied, and are now in compliance, in all material respects, with
all provisions of ERISA, the Code and all laws and regulations applicable to
such Unizan Benefit Plans. Each Plan has been administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms. There is not now, nor do any
circumstances exist that could give rise to, any requirement for the posting
of security with respect to a Plan or the imposition of any lien on the assets
of Unizan or any of its Subsidiaries under ERISA or the Code. Section 3.11(c)
of the Unizan Disclosure Schedule identifies each Plan that is intended to be
a "qualified plan" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code
("Qualified Plans"). The Internal Revenue Service has issued a favorable
determination letter with respect to each Qualified Plan and the related
trust that has not been revoked, and there are no existing circumstances and
no events have occurred that could adversely affect the qualified status of
any Qualified Plan or the related trust. No trust funding any Plan
is intended to meet the requirements of Code Section 501(c)(9). None of
Unizan and its Subsidiaries nor any other person, including any fiduciary, has
engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 406 of ERISA), which could subject any of the Unizan Benefit
Plans or their related trusts, Unizan, any of its Subsidiaries or any person
that Unizan or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify, to any
material tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502
of ERISA.



(e) With respect to each Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of
ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code: (i) there does not exist any
accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code
or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived; (ii) the fair market value of
the assets of such Plan equals or exceeds the actuarial present value of all
accrued benefits under such Plan (whether or not vested) on a termination
basis; (iii) no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of
ERISA for which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived has
occurred, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
agreement will not result in the occurrence of any such reportable
event; (iv) all premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation have
been timely paid in full; (v) no liability (other than for premiums to the
PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by Unizan
or any of its Subsidiaries; and (vi) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings
to terminate any such Plan and, to Unizans knowledge, no condition exists
that presents a risk that such proceedings will be instituted or which would
constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the
appointment of a trustee to administer, any such Plan.



 

15 (f) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(g) of the Unizan Disclosure Schedule:
(i) no Unizan Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a plan that has two or
more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control,
within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer Plan"); (ii)
none of Unizan and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Unizan ERISA
Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been
obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan;
and (iii) none of Unizan and its Subsidiaries nor any Unizan ERISA Affiliates
has incurred any Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied in full.
There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could result in,
any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of Unizan or any of
its Subsidiaries following the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, neither Unizan nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective Unizan ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described
in Section 4069 or Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA.



(g) Except for any such benefits described in Section 3.11(g) of the Unizan
Disclosure Schedule with respect to the individuals listed thereon, Unizan and
its Subsidiaries have no liability for life, health, medical or other
welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof,
except for health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of the
Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and at no expense to Unizan and its
Subsidiaries. Unizan and each of its Subsidiaries has reserved the right to
amend, terminate or modify at any time all plans or arrangements providing for
retiree health or life insurance coverage.



(h) Section 3.11(i) of the Unizan Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) an
accurate and complete description of each provision of any Plan or Employment
Agreement under which the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby could (either along or in
conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the accelerated vesting,
funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment or
benefit to any employee, officer or director of Unizan or any of its
Subsidiaries, or could limit the right of Unizan or any of its Subsidiaries to
amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Unizan
Benefit Plan or related trust or any Employment Agreement or related trust,
and (ii) the maximum amount of the "excess parachute payments" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code that could become payable by Unizan or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.



(i) No labor organization or group of employees of Unizan or any of
its Subsidiaries has made a pending demand for recognition or certification,
and there are no representation or certification proceedings or petitions
seeking a representation proceeding presently pending or threatened to be
brought or filed, with the National Labor Relations Board or any other labor
relations tribunal or authority. Each of Unizan and its Subsidiaries is in
compliance with all applicable laws and collective bargaining agreements
respecting employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment, wages and hours and occupational safety and health.



(j) Each individual who renders services to Unizan or any of its Subsidiaries
who is classified by Unizan or such Subsidiary, as applicable, as having the
status of an  



 

16  independent contractor or other non-employee status for any purpose
(including for purposes of taxation and tax reporting and under Unizan Benefit
Plans) is properly so characterized. Unizan, its Subsidiaries and each member
of their respective business enterprises has complied with the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and all similar state, local and
foreign laws.



(k) All Unizan Benefit Plans subject to the laws of any jurisdiction
outside of the United States (i) have been maintained in accordance with all
applicable requirements, (ii) if they are intended to qualify for special tax
treatment meet all requirements for such treatment, and (iii) if they are
intended to be funded and/or book-reserved are fully funded and/or book
reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions.



3.12 _SEC Reports_. Unizan has previously made available to Huntington an
accurate and complete copy of each (i) final registration
statement, prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed
since January 1, 2000 by Unizan with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act (the " _Unizan Reports_ "), and prior to the date of this
Agreement and (ii) communication mailed by Unizan to its shareholders since
January 1, 2000 and prior to the date of this Agreement, and no such Unizan
Report or communication, as of the date of such Unizan Report or
communication, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which
they were made, not misleading, except that information as of a later date
(but before the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information
as of an earlier date. Since January 1, 2000, as of their respective dates,
all Unizan Reports filed under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto.



3.13 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. (a) Unizan and each of its Subsidiaries
hold all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the
lawful conduct of their respective businesses under and pursuant to each, and
have complied in all respects with and are not in default in any respect under
any, applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy or guideline of
any Governmental Entity relating to Unizan or any of its Subsidiaries, except
where the failure to hold such license, franchise, permit or authorization or
such noncompliance or default is not reasonably likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Unizan. Unizan
Bank, N.A., is "well-capitalized" and "well-managed" under applicable
regulatory definitions, and its examination rating under the Community
Reinvestment Act of 1977 is "satisfactory" or better.



(b) Except as is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Unizan, Unizan and each Unizan
Subsidiary have properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a
fiduciary, including accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent,
custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment
advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents, applicable
state and federal law and regulation and common law. None of Unizan,
any Unizan Subsidiary, or any director, officer or employee of Unizan or of
any Unizan Subsidiary, has committed any breach of trust or fiduciary duty
with respect to any such fiduciary account that is reasonably likely to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Unizan,
and, except as would not be reasonably likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a  



 

17  Material Adverse Effect on Unizan, and the accountings for each such
fiduciary account are true and correct and accurately reflect the assets of
such fiduciary account.



3.14 _Certain Contracts_. (a) Except as set forth in the exhibit index for
Unizans Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 or as
permitted pursuant to Section 5.2 or as set forth on Section 3.14 of Unizan
Disclosure Schedule, neither Unizan nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
or bound by (i) any agreement relating to the incurring of Indebtedness (as
defined below) by Unizan or any of its Subsidiaries in an amount in excess in
the aggregate of $250,000 (collectively, " _Instruments of Indebtedness_ "),
(ii) any "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC), (iii) any non-competition or exclusive dealing
agreement, or any other agreement or obligation which purports to limit or
restrict in any respect (A) the ability of Unizan or its Subsidiaries to
solicit customers or (B) the manner in which, or the localities in which, all
or any portion of the business of Unizan and its Subsidiaries or,
following consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Huntington and its Subsidiaries, is or would be conducted, (iv) any agreement
providing for the indemnification by Unizan or a Subsidiary of Unizan of any
Person other than customary agreements with directors or officers of Unizan
or its Subsidiaries or with vendors providing goods or services to Unizan or
its Subsidiaries where the potential indemnity obligations thereunder are not
reasonably expected to be material to Unizan, (v) any joint venture or
partnership agreement material to Unizan, (vi) any agreement that grants any
right of first refusal or right of first offer or similar right or that limits
or purports to limit the ability of Unizan or any of its Subsidiaries to own,
operate, sell, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of any assets or
business, (vii) any contract or agreement providing for any payments that are
conditioned, in whole or in part, on a change of control of Unizan or any of
its Subsidiaries, (viii) any collective bargaining agreement, (ix) any
employment agreement (other than agreements terminable by Unizan or any
Subsidiary of Unizan on not more than 30 days notice without penalty and
which will not in any respect be affected by a change of control of Unizan),
with, or any agreement or arrangement that contains any severance pay or post-
employment liabilities or obligations (other than as required by law) to, any
current or former director, officer or employee of Unizan or its
Subsidiaries, (x) any agreement regarding any agent bank or other similar
relationships with respect to lines of business, (xi) any agreement that
contains a "most favored nation" clause or other term providing preferential
pricing or treatment to a third party, (xii) any agreement material to Unizan
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, pertaining to the use of or granting
any right to use or practice any rights under any Intellectual Property,
whether Unizan is the licensee or licensor thereunder, (xiii) any agreements
pursuant to which Unizan or any of its Subsidiaries leases any real property,
(xiv) any contract or agreement material to Unizan and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, providing for the outsourcing or provision of servicing of
customers, technology or product offerings of Unizan or its Subsidiaries, and
(xv) any contract or other agreement not made in the ordinary course of
business which (A) is material to Unizan and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole or (B) which would reasonably be expected to materially delay the
consummation of the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the agreements, contracts and obligations of the type described
in clauses (i) through (xv) being referred to herein as " _Unizan Material
Contracts_ ").



(b) Each Unizan Material Contract is valid and binding on Unizan (or, to the
extent a Subsidiary of Unizan is a party, such Subsidiary) and, to
the knowledge of Unizan, any  



 

18  other party thereto and is in full force and effect. Neither Unizan nor any
of its Subsidiaries is in breach or default under any Unizan Material
Contract except where any such breach or default would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on Unizan. Neither Unizan nor any Subsidiary of Unizan knows of, or has
received notice of, any violation or default under (nor, to the knowledge of
Unizan, does there exist any condition which with the passage of time or the
giving of notice or both would result in such a violation or default under)
any Unizan Material Contract by any other party thereto except where any such
violation or default would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Unizan. Prior to the
date hereof, Unizan has made available to Huntington true and complete copies
of all Unizan Material Contracts. There are no provisions in any Instrument of
Indebtedness that provide any restrictions on the repayment of the outstanding
Indebtedness thereunder, or that require that any financial payment
(other than payment of outstanding principal and accrued interest) be made in
the event of the repayment of the outstanding Indebtedness thereunder prior to
expiration. For purposes of this _Section 3.14_ and elsewhere through this
Agreement, " _Indebtedness_ " of a person shall mean (i) all obligations of
such person for borrowed money, (ii) all obligations of such person evidenced
by bonds, debentures, notes and similar instruments, (iii) all leases of such
person capitalized pursuant to GAAP, and (iv) all obligations of such person
under sale-and-lease back transactions, agreements to repurchase securities
sold and other similar financing transactions.



3.15 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Neither Unizan nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement
action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or
memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or
similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has
been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or has been since January 1,
2000, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or since January 1, 2000,
has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request or
suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that
currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or
that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to
pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its management or its
business, other than those of general application that apply to similarly
situated financial holding companies or their Subsidiaries (each item in this
sentence, whether or not set forth in the Unizan Disclosure Schedule, a "
_Unizan Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has Unizan or any of its Subsidiaries
been advised since January 1, 2000 by any Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering, or
requesting any such Unizan Regulatory Agreement.



3.16 _Interest Rate Risk Management Instruments_. Except as would not be
reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on Unizan, (i) all interest rate swaps, caps,
floors and option agreements and other interest rate risk management
arrangements, whether entered into for the account of Unizan or for the
account of a customer of Unizan or any of its Subsidiaries, were entered into
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and in
accordance with prudent banking practice and applicable rules, regulations and
policies of any Regulatory Authority and with counterparties believed to be
financially responsible at the time and are legal, valid and binding
obligations of Unizan or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable against it in
accordance with their terms (except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting
the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies),
and are in full force  



 

19  and effect, (ii) its Subsidiaries have duly performed their obligations
thereunder to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued, and,
(iii) to Unizans knowledge, there are no breaches, violations or defaults or
allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder.



3.17 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except for those liabilities that are
reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of
Unizan included in the Unizan 10-Q (including any notes thereto) and for
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since September 30, 2003, since such date, neither Unizan nor any of
its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due)
that has had or is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Unizan.



3.18 _Environmental Liability_. There are no legal, administrative, arbitral
or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental
investigations or remediation activities or governmental investigations of any
nature seeking to impose, or that are reasonably likely to result in the
imposition, on Unizan of any liability or obligation arising under common law
or under any local, state or federal environmental statute, regulation or
ordinance including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, pending or threatened against Unizan,
which liability or obligation is reasonably likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Unizan. To the
knowledge of Unizan, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding,
claim, action or governmental investigation that would impose any liability or
obligation that would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Unizan. Unizan is not subject to any
agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any
Governmental Entity or third party imposing any liability or obligation with
respect to the foregoing that is reasonably likely to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Unizan.



3.19 _Real Property_.



(a) Each of Unizan and its Subsidiaries has good title free and clear of all
Liens to all real property owned by such entities (the " _Owned Properties_
"), except for Liens that do not materially detract from the present use of
such real property.



(b) A true and complete copy of each agreement pursuant to which Unizan
or any of its Subsidiaries leases any real property (such agreements,
together with any amendments, modifications and other supplements thereto,
collectively, the " _Leases_ ") has heretofore been made available to
Huntington. Each Lease is valid, binding and enforceable against Unizan or
its applicable Subsidiary in accordance with its terms and is in full force
and effect (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally
and the availability of equitable remedies). There are no defaults by Unizan
or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, under any of the Leases which, in
the aggregate, would result in the termination of such Leases and a Material
Adverse Effect on Unizan. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not cause defaults under the Leases, except for any such
default which would not individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on Unizan.



 

20 (c) The Owned Properties and the properties (the " _Leased Properties_ ")
leased pursuant to the Leases constitute all of the real estate on which
Unizan and its Subsidiaries maintain their facilities or conduct their
business as of the date of this Agreement, except for locations the loss of
which would not result in a Material Adverse Effect on Unizan.



(d) A true and complete copy of each agreement pursuant to which Unizan or
any of its Subsidiaries leases real property to a third party (such
agreements, together with any amendments, modifications and other supplements
thereto, collectively, the " _Third Party Leases_ ") has heretofore been made
available to Huntington. Each Third Party Lease is valid, binding and
enforceable in accordance with its terms and is in full force and effect
(except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally
and the availability of equitable remedies). There are no existing defaults by
the tenant under any Third Party Lease which, in the aggregate, would result
in the termination of such Third Party Leases except for any such default
which would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect
on Unizan.



3.20 _State Takeover Laws_. The Board of Directors of Unizan has approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as required to render
inapplicable to such agreements and transactions the provisions of Chapter
1704 and Section 1707.043 of the OGCL, Article VIII of the Unizan Articles and
all other similar "takeover" or "interested shareholder" law (any such laws,
" _Takeover Statutes_ ").



3.21  _Reorganization_. As of the date of this Agreement, Unizan is not aware
of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent the
Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.



3.22 _Opinions_. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, Unizan has
received an opinion from Sandler ONeill and Partners, L.P. to the effect that
as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the matters set forth
therein, the Exchange Ratio is fair to the shareholders of Unizan from a
financial point of view. Such opinion has not been amended or rescinded as of
the date of this Agreement.



3.23 _Internal Controls_. None of Unizan or its Subsidiaries records,
systems, controls, data or information are recorded, stored,
maintained, operated or otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or held by
any means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process,
whether computerized or not) which (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom) are not under the exclusive ownership and direct control of it or
its Subsidiaries or accountants except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a materially adverse effect on
the system of internal accounting controls described in the next sentence.
Unizan and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.



3.24 _Insurance_. Unizan and its Subsidiaries are insured with reputable
insurers against such risks and in such amounts as its management reasonably
has determined to be prudent in accordance with industry practices.



 

21 3.25 _Unizan Information_. The information relating to Unizan and its
Subsidiaries contained in the Proxy Statement and the Form S-4, or that is
provided by Unizan or its representatives for inclusion in any other document
filed with any other Regulatory Agency in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not
misleading. The Proxy Statement (except for such portions thereof that relate
only to Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries) will comply in all material
respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF HUNTINGTON



Except as disclosed in a correspondingly numbered section of the disclosure

all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as now conducted, except in each of (i) 

(except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and
the availability of equitable remedies).



(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Huntington, nor

respective properties or permits, licenses or authorizations, is pending or,
to the knowledge of Huntington, threatened.



(b) There is no material Injunction, judgment, or regulatory restriction

financial or bank holding companies or their Subsidiaries) imposed upon
Huntington, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of Huntington or any of its
Subsidiaries.



4.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_. Each of Huntington and its Subsidiaries has duly
filed all federal, state, foreign and local information returns and Tax
returns required to be filed by it on or prior to the date of this Agreement
(all such returns being accurate and complete in all material respects) and
has duly paid or made provision for the payment of all Taxes that have been
incurred or are due or claimed to be due from it by federal, state, foreign or
local taxing authorities other than (i) Taxes or other governmental charges
that are not yet delinquent or are being contested in good faith, have not
been finally determined and have been adequately reserved against, or (ii)
information returns, Tax returns or Taxes as to which the failure to file, pay
or make provision for is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Huntington.



4.11 _SEC Reports_. Huntington has previously made available to Unizan an
accurate and complete copy of each (i) final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive Proxy Statement filed since
January 1, 2000 by Huntington with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or

Agreement and (ii) communication mailed by Huntington to its stockholders
since January 1, 2000 and prior to the date of this Agreement, and no such
Huntington Report or communication, as of the date of such Huntington Report
or communication, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they were made, not misleading, except that information as of a later
date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify
information as of an earlier date. Since January 1, 2000, as of their
respective dates, all Huntington Reports filed under the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto.



4.12 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. (a) Huntington and each of its
Subsidiaries hold all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations
necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses under and
pursuant to each, and have complied in all respects with and are not in
default in any respect under any, applicable law, statute, order, rule,
regulation, policy or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to
Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries, except where the failure to hold such
license, franchise, permit or authorization or such noncompliance or default
is not reasonably likely to, either individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on Huntington. The Huntington National Bank is "well-
capitalized" and "well-managed" under applicable regulatory definitions, and
its examination rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 is
"satisfactory" or better.



 

26 (b) Except as is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Huntington, Huntington and each
Huntington Subsidiary have properly administered all accounts for which it
acts as a fiduciary, including accounts for which it serves as a trustee,
agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or
investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents,
applicable state and federal law and regulation and common law. None of
Huntington, any Huntington Subsidiary, or any director, officer or
employee of Huntington or of any Huntington Subsidiary, has committed any
breach of trust or fiduciary duty with respect to any such fiduciary account
that is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Huntington, and, except as would not be reasonably
likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Huntington and the accountings for each such fiduciary account are
true and correct and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.



4.13 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Neither Huntington nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement
action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or
memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or
similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has
been since January 1, 2000, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or has
been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or since January 1, 2000, has
adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request or
suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that
currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or
that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to
pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its management or its
business, other than those of general application that apply to similarly
situated financial holding companies or their Subsidiaries (each, whether or
not set forth in the Huntington Disclosure Schedule, a " _Huntington
Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries been
advised since January 1, 2000, by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental
Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering or requesting any
such Huntington Regulatory Agreement.



4.14 _Interest Rate Risk Management Instruments_. Except as would not be
reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on Huntington, (i) all interest rate swaps, caps,
floors and option agreements and other interest rate risk management
arrangements, whether entered into for the account of Huntington or for the
account of a customer of Huntington or one of its Subsidiaries, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and in
accordance with prudent banking practice and applicable rules, regulations and
policies of any Regulatory Authority and with counterparties believed to be
financially responsible at the time and are legal, valid and binding
obligations of Huntington or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable against it in
accordance with their terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies), and are in
full force and effect, (ii) each of its Subsidiaries have duly performed
their obligations thereunder to the extent that such obligations to perform
have accrued, and (iii) to Huntingtons knowledge, there are no breaches,
violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party
thereunder.



 

27 4.15 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except for those liabilities that are
reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Huntington
included in the Huntington 10-Q (including any notes thereto) and for
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since September 30, 2003, since such date, neither Huntington nor
any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to
become due) that, either individually or in the aggregate, has had or
is reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Huntington.



4.16 _Environmental Liability_. There are no legal, administrative, arbitral
or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental
investigations or remediation activities or governmental investigations of
any nature seeking to impose, or that are reasonably likely to result in the
imposition, on Huntington of any liability or obligation arising under common
law or under any local, state or federal environmental statute, regulation or
ordinance including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, pending or threatened against
Huntington, which liability or obligation is reasonably likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Huntington. To
the knowledge of Huntington, there is no reasonable basis for any such
proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation that would impose any
liability or obligation that would be reasonably likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Huntington. Huntington is
not subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by
or with any Governmental Entity or third party imposing any liability
or obligation with respect to the foregoing that is reasonably likely to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Huntington.



4.17 _Reorganization_. As of the date of this Agreement, Huntington is not
aware of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be expected
to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.



4.18 _Internal Controls_. None of Huntington or its Subsidiaries records,
systems, controls, data or information are recorded, stored, maintained,
operated or otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or held by any means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) which (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom) are not under the exclusive ownership and direct control of it or
its Subsidiaries or accountants except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a materially adverse effect on
the system of internal accounting controls described in the next sentence.
Huntington and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.



4.19 _Huntington Information_. The information relating to Huntington and its
Subsidiaries that is provided by Huntington for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement and the Form S-4, or the information relating to Huntington and its
Subsidiaries that is provided by Huntington or its representatives for
inclusion in any other document filed with any other Regulatory Agency in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements  



 

28  therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not
misleading. The Form S-4 will comply with the provisions of the Securities Act

(c) Each of Huntington and Unizan shall, upon request, furnish to the other
all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Huntington,
Unizan or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



(d) Each of Huntington and Unizan shall promptly advise the other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity consent or approval
of which is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that
the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed.



 

33 6.2 _Access to Information_. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, each of Unizan and
Huntington shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of the
other, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts,
commitments and records, and, during such period, the parties shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party all
other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the
other may reasonably request. Unizan shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, provide to Huntington a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or
state banking laws (other than reports or documents that such party is not
permitted to disclose under applicable law). Neither Unizan nor Huntington
nor any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene
any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties shall
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.



(b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement shall
be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement entered into
between the parties as of December 19, 2003 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_
"). Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the disclosure of the tax
treatment and tax structure, as those terms are used in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.6011-4, of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (but no
other details about the matters covered by this Agreement, including without
limitation the identities of the parties) from and after the date of the
public announcement by the parties of this Agreement and the Merger.



(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of the other
set forth in this Agreement.



6.3  _Shareholder Approval_. Unizan shall call a meeting of its shareholders
to be held as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of obtaining the
requisite shareholder approval required in connection with this Agreement and
the Merger (the " _Unizan Shareholder Meeting_ "), and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such meeting to occur as soon as reasonably
practicable. The Board of Directors of Unizan shall recommend to Unizans
shareholders the approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Unizan Recommendation_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that Unizans Board of Directors shall not be
required to make such Unizan Recommendation to the extent provided in
_Section 6.13_. Notwithstanding any Change in Unizan Recommendation, unless
otherwise directed in writing by Huntington, this Agreement and the Merger
shall be submitted to the shareholders of Unizan at the Unizan Shareholders
Meeting for the purpose of approving the Agreement and the Merger and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Unizan of such obligation,
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Board of Directors of Unizan shall have
effected a Change in Unizan Recommendation in accordance with this Agreement,
then in submitting this Agreement to Unizans shareholders, the Board of
Directors of Unizan may submit this Agreement to Unizans
shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions adopting  



 

34  this Agreement and the Plan of Merger as of the date hereof may not be
rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors of Unizan may
communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to Unizans
shareholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement
thereto to the extent required by law.



6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Each of Huntington and Unizan shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (i) to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party
or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions
set forth in _Article VII_ , to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to
obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or
any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is
required to be obtained by Unizan or Huntington or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 



6.5 _Affiliates_. Unizan shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each
director, executive officer and other person who is an "affiliate" (for
purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of Unizan to deliver to
Huntington, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement,
and prior to the date of the meeting of the Unizan shareholders to be held
pursuant to _Section 6.3_ , a written agreement, in the form of _Exhibit A_.



6.6 _Nasdaq Approval_. Huntington shall cause the shares of Huntington Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for quotation on the Nasdaq,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.



6.7 _Employee Matters_. (a) From and after the Effective Time, the employees
of Unizan who are employed by the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time (the " _Assumed Employees_ ") and who remain employed with the Surviving
Corporation during such period will be offered participation and coverage
under employee benefit plans that are comparable, on an aggregate basis, to
the plans generally in effect for similarly situated employees of Huntington
and its Subsidiaries (" _Huntington Benefit Plans_ "); _provided_ , that
continued participation and coverage following the Effective Time under the
employee benefit plans of Unizan and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be deemed to satisfy the obligations under this
sentence, it being understood that the Assumed Employees may commence
participating in the Huntington Benefit Plans on different dates following
the Effective Time with respect to different Huntington Benefit Plans.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 6.7(a) to the contrary, from and
after the Effective Time, each Assumed Employee (other than those with
individual agreements providing for severance or "change of control"
benefits) shall be eligible for participation in Huntington Transition Pay
Plan in accordance with the terms thereof, as such terms may be amended from
time to time, which shall be the exclusive source of severance benefits in
connection with the Merger (other than as provided under individual agreements
providing for severance or "change of control" benefits, which agreements are
listed in _Section 6.7_ of the Unizan Disclosure Schedule).



 

35 (b) To the extent permitted by applicable law or the terms of any applicable
insurance policies, Huntington shall cause each Huntington Benefit Plan in
which Assumed Employees are eligible to participate to take into account for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals under the Huntington
Benefit Plans (other than benefit accruals under any of Huntington defined
benefit pension plans including any supplemental defined benefit plans) the
service of such employees with Unizan and its Subsidiaries (and any
predecessor entities) to the same extent as such service was credited for
such purpose by Unizan and its Subsidiaries, _provided_ , _howeve_ r, that
such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period
of service or with respect to newly implemented plans for which prior service
is not taken into account; _provided_ , _further_ , that for purposes of
calculating benefits and determining an Assumed Employees years of service
under Huntington Transition Pay Plan, service with Huntington shall be
measured commencing with the most recent hire date by Unizan and its
Subsidiaries (including any predecessor employers). Nothing herein shall limit
the ability of Huntington or the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate
any of the Unizan Benefit Plans or Huntington Benefits Plans in accordance
with their terms at any time.



(c) At and following the Effective Time, Huntington will cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor the obligations of Unizan or any of its Subsidiaries
as of the Effective Time under the provisions of the Employment Agreements
that are set forth on _Section 6.7(c)_ of the Unizan Disclosure Schedule
between and among Unizan or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
current or former officer, director, consultant or employee of Unizan or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, _provided_ that this provision shall
not prevent the Surviving Corporation from amending, suspending or terminating
any such agreements to the extent permitted by the respective terms of such
agreement.



(d) If Assumed Employees become eligible to participate in a medical, dental
or health plan of Huntington or its Subsidiaries, Huntington shall cause each
such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent
such conditions are covered under the applicable medical, health or dental
plans of Huntington, (ii) honor under such plans any deductible, co-payment
and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such employees and their beneficiaries
during the portion of the calendar year prior to such participation and (iii)
waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement
which would otherwise be applicable to such employee on or after the Effective
Time for the year in which the Effective Time occurs, in each case to the
extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under
an analogous medical dental or health plan of Unizan prior to the Effective
Time for the year in which the Effective Time or participation in such
medical, dental or health plan of Huntington, as applicable, occurs.



(e) Huntington will consider in good faith the recommendations of Mr. Mann
with respect to retention payments to key Unizan employees in order to
maintain continuity of management in connection with the Merger. 



6.8 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) In the event
of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal or administrative, including any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation in which any individual who is now, or has
been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who  



 

36  becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of
Unizan or any of its Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of
Unizan or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another person (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), is, or is threatened to be,
made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out
of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or
employee of Unizan or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or arising
before or after the Effective Time, the parties shall cooperate and use their
best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. From and after the
Effective Time, Huntington shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the
fullest extent currently provided under applicable law, the Unizan Articles,
the Unizan Code and any agreement set forth in _Section 6.8_ of the Unizan
Disclosure Schedule, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reimbursement for reasonable
fees and expenses incurred in advance of the final disposition of any claim,
suit, proceeding or investigation upon receipt of any undertaking required by
applicable law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation.



(b) Huntington shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the individuals
serving as officers and directors of Unizan or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a
period of six years from the Effective Time by the directors and officers
liability insurance policy maintained by Unizan ( _provided_ that Huntington
may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than such
policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time that were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as
such; _provided_ , that in no event shall Huntington be required to expend
more than 200% per year of coverage of the amount currently expended by Unizan
per year of coverage as of the date of this Agreement (the "Maximum Amount")
to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto, and (iii) if
notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts to do so, Huntington is
unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this  _Section 6.8_
, Huntington shall obtain as much comparable insurance as available for the
Maximum Amount, and (iv) such Indemnified Parties may be required to make
reasonable application and provide reasonable and customary representations
and warranties to Huntingtons insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining
such insurance, comparable in nature and scope to the applications,
representations and warranties required of persons who are officers and
directors of Huntington as of the date hereof.



(c) Huntington acknowledges and agrees that it shall assume, effective as of
the Effective Time, the indemnification and other obligations of Unizan set
forth in Section 7.9 of that certain Agreement of Merger and Plan of
Reorganization, dated as of September 5, 2001, by and among UNB Corp. (which
was subsequently renamed Unizan Financial Corp.), The United National Bank and
Trust Company, BancFirst Ohio Corp. and The First National Bank of Zanesville,
N.A., as amended.



(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.



 

37 6.9 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Huntington, on the one
hand, and a Subsidiary of Unizan, on the other) or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals,
immunities and franchises of either party to the Merger, the proper officers
and directors of each party and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all
such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole
expense of, Huntington.



6.10 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Huntington and Unizan shall promptly advise
the other of any change or event (i) having or reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would or would be
reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement; _provided_ _further_ that a failure to comply
with this _Section 6.10_ shall not constitute the failure of any condition
set forth in Article VII to be satisfied unless the underlying Material
Adverse Effect or material breach would independently result in the failure of
a condition set forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied.



6.11 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, Unizan shall coordinate
with Huntington the declaration of any dividends in respect of Unizan Common
Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto such that
holders of Unizan Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to
receive one dividend, for any quarter with respect to their shares of Unizan
Common Stock and any shares of Huntington Common Stock any such holder
receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.



6.12 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Huntington and Unizan
agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain Unizan
Insiders (as defined below) in connection with the Merger, both prior to and
after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Unizan Insiders not be subject
to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares
of Unizan Common Stock and Unizan Stock Options into shares of Huntington
Common Stock and Assumed Stock Options, as applicable, in the Merger, and for
that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this
_Section 6.12_. Assuming that Unizan delivers to Huntington the Section 16
Information (as defined below) in a timely fashion, the Board of Directors of
Huntington, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is
defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a
resolution providing that the receipt by Unizan Insiders of Huntington Common
Stock in exchange for shares of Unizan Common Stock, and of options on
Huntington Common Stock upon conversion of options on Unizan Common Stock, in
each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are
intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the
Exchange Act. " _Section 16 Information_ " shall mean information accurate in
all material respects regarding Unizan Insiders, the number of shares of
Unizan Common Stock held by each such Unizan Insider and expected to be
exchanged for Huntington Common Stock in the Merger, and the number and
description of the options on Unizan Common Stock held by each such Unizan
Insider and expected to be converted into options on Huntington Common Stock
in connection with the  



 

38  Merger; _provided_ that the requirement for a description of any Unizan
Stock Options shall be deemed to be satisfied if copies of all Unizan
Stock Plans, and forms of agreements evidencing grants thereunder, under
which such Unizan Stock Options have been granted, have been made available to
Huntington. " _Unizan Insiders_ " shall mean those officers and directors of
Unizan who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act and who are listed in the Section 16 Information.



6.13 _No Solicitation_.



(a) None of Unizan, its Subsidiaries or any officer, director, employee, agent
or representative (including any investment banker, financial
advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained representative) of Unizan or
any of its Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate or
encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) or take
any other action designed to facilitate any inquiries or proposals regarding
any merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of
capital stock (including, without limitation, by way of a tender offer) or
similar transactions involving Unizan or any of its Subsidiaries that, if
consummated, would constitute an Alternative Transaction (any of the foregoing
inquiries or proposals being referred to herein as an " _Acquisition Proposal_
"), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an
Alternative Transaction or (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any
Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors
of Unizan shall be permitted, prior to the meeting of Unizan shareholders to
be held pursuant to _Section 6.3_ , and subject to compliance with the other
terms of this _Section 6.13_ and to first entering into a confidentiality
agreement with the person proposing such Acquisition Proposal on
terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to Unizan than, those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, to (A) consider and participate in
discussions and negotiations with respect to a bona fide Acquisition Proposal
received by Unizan, and (B) withdraw, modify or qualify the _Unizan
Recommendation, in each case_ if and only to the extent that the Board of
Directors of Unizan reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would cause it to violate
its fiduciary duties.



As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction_ " means any of (i) a
transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) other than
Huntington or its affiliates, directly or indirectly, acquires or would
acquire more than 25 percent of the outstanding shares of Unizan Common Stock
or outstanding voting power or of any new series or new class of preferred
stock that would be entitled to a class or series vote with respect to the
Merger, whether from Unizan or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer
or otherwise, (ii) a merger, share exchange, consolidation or other business
combination involving Unizan (other than the Merger), (iii) any transaction
pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) other than Huntington or
its affiliates acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this
purpose the outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries of Unizan and
securities of the entity surviving any merger or business combination
including any of Unizans Subsidiaries) of Unizan, or any of its subsidiaries
representing more than 25 percent of the fair market value of all the assets,
net revenues or net income of Unizan and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
immediately prior to such transaction, or (iv) any other consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving Unizan
or any of its subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as a result of which the holders of shares of Unizan Common Stock
immediately prior to such transaction do not, in the aggregate, own at  



 

39  least 75 percent of each of the outstanding shares of common stock and the
outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity in such
transaction immediately after the consummation thereof in substantially the
same proportion as such holders held the shares of Unizan Common Stock
immediately prior to the consummation thereof.



(b) Unizan shall notify Huntington promptly (but in no event later than 24
hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any material
modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or any
request for nonpublic information relating to Unizan or any of its
Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of Unizan or
any Subsidiary by any Person or entity that informs the Board of Directors of
Unizan or any Subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to Huntington shall be made orally and in
writing, and shall indicate the identity of the Person making the Acquisition
Proposal or intending to make or considering making an Acquisition Proposal or
requesting non-public information or access to the books and records of Unizan
or any Subsidiary, and the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or
modification or amendment to an Acquisition Proposal. Unizan shall keep
Huntington fully informed, on a current basis, of any material changes in the
status and any material changes or modifications in the terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. Unizan shall also promptly, and
in any event within 24 hours, notify Huntington, orally and in writing, if it
enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal
in accordance with _Section 6.13(a)_.



(c) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.13_ shall prohibit Unizan or its
Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act.



(d) Unizan and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons
(other than Huntington) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
foregoing, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons other
than Huntington who have been furnished confidential information regarding
Unizan in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an
Acquisition Proposal within the 12 months prior to the date hereof promptly to
return or destroy such information. Unizan agrees not to, and to cause its
Subsidiaries not to, release any third party from the confidentiality and
standstill provisions of any agreement to which Unizan or its Subsidiaries is
or may become a party, and shall immediately take all steps necessary
to terminate any approval that may have been heretofore given under any such
provisions authorizing any person to make an Acquisition Proposal.



(e) Unizan shall ensure that the officers, directors and all employees, agents
and representatives (including any investment bankers, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants or other retained representatives) of Unizan
or its Subsidiaries are aware of the restrictions described in this _Section
6.13_ as reasonably necessary to avoid violations thereof. It is understood
that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.13_ by
any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained
representative) of Unizan or its Subsidiaries, at the direction or with the
consent of Unizan or its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section 6.13_ by Unizan.



 

40 6.14 _Transition_. (a) Commencing following the date hereof, Huntington and
Unizan shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their
reasonable best efforts to facilitate the integration of Unizan and its
Subsidiaries with the businesses of Huntington and its Subsidiaries to be
effective as of the Closing Date or such later date as may be determined by
Huntington. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from the date
hereof through the Closing Date and consistent with the performance of their
day-to-day operations and the continuous operation of Unizan and
its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business, Unizan shall cause the
employees and officers of Unizan and its Subsidiaries, including the Bank, to
use their reasonable best efforts to provide support, including support from
its outside contractors, and to assist Huntington in performing all tasks,
including equipment installation, reasonably required to result in a
successful integration at the Closing or such later date as may be determined
by Huntington.



(b) Huntington and Unizan agree to consult with respect to their
litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices and Unizan shall
make such modifications or changes to its policies and practices, if any, and
at such date prior to the Effective Time, as Huntington shall reasonably
request. Unizan shall continue to utilize its existing loan policies and
practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves); _provided_
, _however_ , that Unizan shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent
to any reasonable request by Huntington that Unizan make modifications or
changes thereto and Unizan shall make such changes promptly after granting any
such consent or at such later date as the parties may agree. Huntington and
Unizan shall also consult with respect to the character, amount and timing of
restructuring charges to be taken by each of them in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and shall take such charges as Huntington
shall reasonably request. No partys representations, warranties
and covenants contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be untrue or
breached in any respect for any purpose as a consequence of any modifications
or changes to such policies and practices which may be undertaken on account
of this _Section 6.14_.



6.15 _Directorship_. Huntington shall increase the size of its Board of
Directors, to the extent necessary, and shall appoint to its Board of
Directors one additional director selected by Huntington from the current
Unizan Board of Directors (who shall be reasonably acceptable to Unizan),
with such appointment to be effective as of the Effective Time, with the
intent being that such new director would serve a term ending no earlier than
the 2007 annual shareholder meeting.

43 ARTICLE VIII



TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT



8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the shareholders of Unizan or Huntington:



(a) by mutual consent of Unizan and Huntington in a written instrument, if the
Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the
members of its respective entire Board of Directors;

 



(b) by either the Board of Directors of Unizan or the Board of Directors of
Huntington if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory
Approval has denied approval of the Merger and such denial has become final
and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall
have issued a final and nonappealable order permanently enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement;



(c) by either the Board of Directors of Unizan or the Board of Directors of
Huntington if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before
the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement unless the failure of the
Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking
to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements
of such party set forth in this Agreement;



(d) by either the Board of Directors of Huntington or the Board of Directors
of Unizan if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or
agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in this
Agreement on the part of Unizan, in the case of a termination by Huntington,
or Huntington, in the case of a termination by Unizan, which breach, either
individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if occurring or continuing
on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_
 or _7.3_ , as the case may be, and which is not cured within 45 days
following written notice to the party committing such breach or by its nature
or timing cannot be cured within such time period;



(e) by either the Board of Directors of Huntington or the Board of
Directors of Unizan if Unizan shall have failed to obtain the requisite
affirmative vote in favor of approving and adopting this Agreement from the
holders of Unizan Common Stock entitled to vote thereon at the Unizan
Shareholder Meeting; _provided_ that the right of Unizan to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) shall not be available to it if it
has failed to comply in all material respects with its obligations under
_Section 6.3_ or _6.13_ ;



(f) By the Board of Directors of Huntington if Unizan has (i) failed to
make the Unizan Recommendation or has modified or qualified such
recommendation in a manner adverse to Huntington, (ii) failed to substantially
comply with its obligations under _Section 6.3_ or _6.13_ or (iii) recommended
or endorsed an Alternative Transaction; or



(g) by Unizan, if the Unizan Board of Directors so determines by the vote of
a majority of all of its members, by giving written notice to Huntington not
later than the end of  



 

44  the second Business day next following the Determination Date, in the event
that, as of the Determination Date, both of the following conditions
are satisfied:



(i) the Average Closing Price shall be less than 80% of the Huntington
Starting Price; and



(ii) (A) the number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the
Huntington Starting Price (such number, the " _Huntington Ratio_ ") is less
than (B) the number obtained by dividing the Final Index Price by the Initial
Index Price and subtracting 0.15 from such quotient (such number, the "
_Index Ratio_ ").



If Unizan elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to this Section
8.1(g), it shall give written notice to Huntington. During the five-business-
day period commencing with its receipt of such notice, Huntington may, at its
option (the " _Fill Option_ "), adjust the Exchange Ratio to equal the lesser
of (i) a number equal to a quotient (rounded to the nearest one-ten-
thousandth), the numerator of which is the product of 0.80, the Huntington
Starting Price and the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) and the denominator
of which is the Average Closing Price, and (ii) a number equal to a quotient
(rounded to the nearest one-ten-thousandth), the numerator of which is the
Index Ratio multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) and the
denominator of which is the Huntington Ratio. If Huntington makes an election
contemplated by the preceding sentence within such five-day period, it shall
give prompt written notice to Unizan of such election and the revised
Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this
Section 8.1(g) and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with
its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified), and any
references in this Agreement to " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall thereafter be
deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio as adjusted pursuant to this Section
8.1(g).



For purposes of this Section 8.1(g), the following terms shall have
the meanings set forth below:



" _Average Closing Price_ " of the Huntington Common Stock shall mean the
arithmetic mean of the daily closing sales prices per share of Huntington
Common Stock reported on the Nasdaq National Market (as reported by the _Wall
Street Journal_ or, if not reported thereby, another authoritative source)
for the five consecutive full Nasdaq trading days ending at the close of
trading on the Determination Date (with a proportionate adjustment in the
event that the outstanding shares of common stock of Huntington shall be
changed into a different number of shares by reason of any stock dividend,
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares
or similar transaction between the date of the Agreement and
the Determination Date).



" _Business day_ " means Monday through Friday of each week, except a legal
holiday recognized as such by the U.S. Government or any day on which banking
institutions in the State of Ohio are authorized or obligated by law to close.



 

45 " _Determination Date_ " means the date on which the last Requisite Regulatory
Approval shall have been obtained, without regard to any requisite waiting
period, or, if later, on the date ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date.



" _Final Index Price_ " means the arithmetic mean of the daily closing values
of the SandP Bank Index (Bloomberg: S5BANKX) (the " _Bank Index_ ") for the
five trading days utilized in calculating the Average Closing Price.



" _Initial Index Price_ " means $354.67, the closing value of the Bank Index
on January 26, 2004.



" _Huntington Starting Price_ " means $23.10, the closing sale price per
share of Huntington Common Stock reported on the Nasdaq National Market on
January 26, 2004.



8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Unizan or Huntington as provided in _Section 8.1_ , this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of Unizan,
Huntington, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or
directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever
under this Agreement, or in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except that (i) _Sections 6.2(b)_ , _8.2_ , _8.3_ , _9.2_ ,
_9.3_ , _9.8_ and _9.9_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and
(ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
neither Unizan nor Huntington shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its willful breach of any provision of
this Agreement.



8.3 _Termination Fee_. (a) In the event that (A) a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal shall have been communicated to or otherwise made known
to the shareholders, senior management or Board of Directors of Unizan, or any
person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional)
to make an Acquisition Proposal, after the date of this Agreement, which
Acquisition Proposal shall not have been irrevocably withdrawn prior to the
Unizan Shareholder Meeting, (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by
either Huntington or Unizan pursuant to Section 8.1(e), by Huntington
pursuant to Section 8.1(f) or by Huntington pursuant to Section 8.1(d) as a
result of a willful breach by Unizan and (C) prior to the date that is
eighteen (18) months after the date of such termination Unizan consummates
an Alternative Transaction or enters into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to an
Alternative Transaction, then Unizan shall on the date an Alternative
Transaction is consummated or any such letter executed or agreement entered
into, pay Huntington a fee equal to $20,000,000 (twenty million dollars) by
wire transfer of same day funds.



(b) Unizan acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, Huntington would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Unizan fails promptly to pay the amount due
pursuant to this Section 8.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, Huntington
commences a suit which results in a judgment against Unizan for the fee set
forth in this Section 8.3, Unizan shall pay to Huntington its costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount  



 

46  of the fee at the rate on six-month U.S. Treasury obligations plus 300 basis
points in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

 



8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law and  _Section
1.1(b)_ , this Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action taken or
authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or
after approval of the matters presented in connection with Merger by the
shareholders of Unizan or Huntington; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any
approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
shareholders of Unizan, there may not be, without further approval of such
shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement governed by Section 1701.79(E)
of the OGCL. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.



8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties,
by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of Directors, may, to
the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and (iii)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the shareholders of Unizan and
Huntington, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders,
any extension or waiver of this Agreement or any portion hereof that reduces
the amount or changes the form of the consideration to be delivered to the
holders of Unizan Common Stock under this Agreement, other than as
contemplated by this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement
or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure.

50 Form of Affiliate Letter



Huntington Bancshares Incorporated

41 South High Street

Columbus, Ohio 43287



Ladies and Gentlemen:



I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of Unizan Financial Corp., an Ohio corporation (" _Unizan_ "), as
the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule
145 of the Rules and Regulations (the " _Rules and Regulations_ ") of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _Commission_ ") under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Act_ "). I have been further
advised that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated
as of January 27, 2004 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and between
Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, a Maryland corporation (" _Huntington_ "),
and Unizan, Unizan shall be merged with and into Huntington (the " _Merger_ ")
and each share of the common stock, without par value, of Unizan (" _Unizan
Common Stock_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive 1.1424 shares of
common stock, without par value, of Huntington (" _Huntington Common Stock_
"). All terms used in this letter but not defined herein shall have the
meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement.



I represent, warrant and covenant to Huntington that in the event I receive
any Huntington Common Stock as a result of the Merger:



(a) I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of
Huntington Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.



(b) I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed
its requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of Huntington Common Stock to the extent I
believed necessary with my counsel or counsel for Unizan.



(c) I have been advised that the issuance of Huntington Common Stock to me
pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act on
a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that,
since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the shareholders
of Unizan I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of Unizan and the
distribution by me of Huntington Common Stock has not been registered under
the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Huntington Common
Stock issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other
disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or
other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations
of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act, or (iii) in the
opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Huntington, such sale, transfer or
other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act.



(d) I understand that Huntington is under no obligation to register the
sale, transfer or other disposition of Huntington Common Stock by me or on my
behalf under the Act or to take  



 

51  any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption
from such registration available.



(e) I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given
to Huntingtons transfer agents with respect to Huntington Common Stock and
that there will be placed on the certificates for Huntington Common Stock
issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:



"The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in
a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933
applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in compliance with the
requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a registration statement under said
act or an exemption from such registration."



(f) I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Huntington Common
Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with
the provisions of Rule 145, Huntington reserves the right to put the following
legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:



"The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under
the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such
shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act
of 1933 applies. The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view
to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the
meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or
otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."



It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth above shall be removed
by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend, and/or the
issuance of a letter to Huntingtons transfer agent removing such stop
transfer instructions, and the above restrictions on sale will cease to
apply, if (A) one year (or such other period as may be required by Rule
145(d)(2) under the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have
elapsed from the Closing Date and the provisions of such Rule are then
available to me; or (B) if two years (or such other period as may be required
by Rule 145(d)(3) under the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall
have elapsed from the Effective Date and the provisions of such Rule are then
available to me; or (C) I shall have delivered to Huntington (i) a copy of a
letter from the staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Huntington, or other evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Huntington, to the effect that such legend and/or stop
transfer instructions are not required for purposes of the Securities Act or
(ii) reasonably satisfactory evidence or representations that the securities
represented by such certificates are being or have been transferred in a
transaction made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act or pursuant to an effective registration under the Securities
Act.



 

52 I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to (i) my
spouse, (ii) any relative of mine or my spouse occupying my home, (iii) any
trust or estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10%
beneficial interest or of which any of us serves as trustee, executor or in
any similar capacity and (iv) any corporate or other organization in which I,
my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% of any class of equity
securities or of the equity interest.



It is understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall terminate and be
of no further force and effect if the Merger Agreement is terminated
in accordance with its terms.



Execution of this letter should not be construed as an admission on my part
that I am an "affiliate" of Unizan as described in the first paragraph of this
letter or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that I
am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.
