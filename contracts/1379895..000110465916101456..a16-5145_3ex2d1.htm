(ii) _Dollars_. Any reference in this Agreement to $ or dollar amounts or
funds or sums (or phrases of similar import) shall mean and refer to U.S.
dollars, the lawful currency of the United States. The specification of any
dollar amount in the representations and warranties or otherwise in this
Agreement or in the schedules hereto is not intended and shall not be deemed
to be an admission or acknowledgement of the materiality of such amounts or
items, nor shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy between the
parties to determine whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not
described herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for
purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(iii) _Exhibits/Schedules_. The exhibits and schedules to this Agreement are
an integral part of this Agreement. All exhibits and schedules annexed hereto
or referred to herein are hereby incorporated in and made a part of this
Agreement as if set forth in full herein. Any matter or item disclosed on one
schedule shall be deemed to have been disclosed on each other schedule to the
extent it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. Disclosure of
any item on any schedule shall not constitute an

 



      
 

 



 

admission or indication that any such item is required to be disclosed, or
that such item or matter is material or has resulted in or will result in a
Material Adverse Effect. No disclosure on a schedule relating to a possible
breach or violation of any Contract, Law or Order shall be construed as an
admission or indication that a breach or violation exists or has actually
occurred. Any capitalized terms used in any schedule or exhibit to this
Agreement but not otherwise defined therein shall be defined as set forth in
this Agreement.

 



 

(iv) _Gender and Number_. Any reference in this Agreement to gender shall
include all genders, and words imparting the singular number only shall
include the plural and vice versa.

 



 

(v) _Headings_. The provision of a table of contents, the division of this
Agreement into articles, sections and other subdivisions and the insertion of
headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect or be
utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All references in this
Agreement to any "Section" are to the corresponding section of this Agreement
unless otherwise specified.

 



 

(vi) _Herein_. The words such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof," and
"hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a subdivision
in which such words appear unless the context otherwise requires.

 



 

(vii) _Or_. The word "or" is disjunctive but not necessarily exclusive.

 



 

(viii) _Including_. The word "including" or any variation thereof means
(unless the context of its usage otherwise requires) "including, without
limitation" and shall not be construed to limit any general statement that it
follows to the specific or similar items or matters immediately following it.

 



 

(ix) _Reflected On or Set Forth In_. An item arising with respect to a
specific representation or warranty shall be deemed to be "reflected on" or
"set forth in" a balance sheet or financial statements, to the extent any such
phrase (or phrase of similar import) appears in such representation or
warranty, if (a) there is an identifiable reserve, accrual or other similar
item underlying a number on such balance sheet or financial statements that
related to the subject matter of such representation, (b) such item is
otherwise specifically set forth on the balance sheet or financial statements
or (c) such item is reflected on the balance sheet or financial statements and
is specifically set forth in the notes thereto.

 



 

(x) _Order of Precedence_. If any provision of any schedule or any exhibit
conflicts with a provision in the body of this Agreement, the provision in the
body of this Agreement shall control, unless such provision of the schedule or
exhibit expressly states that it supersedes a specifically identified section
in the body of this Agreement, in which case such specifically identified
section shall be superseded only with respect to the specific provision of the
schedule or exhibit. If any provision of this Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

conflicts with a provision in any Related Document, the provision of this
Agreement shall control, unless such provision of a Related Document expressly
states that it supersedes a specifically identified section in the body of
this Agreement, in which case such specifically identified section of this
Agreement shall be superseded only with respect to such provision in the
applicable Related Document.

 



 

(xi) _Books and Records_. For purposes of _Section 8.1(b)_, the phrase "books
and records" (and correlative terms) shall not include e-mail, instant
messages, text messages, recorded voicemails and other electronic employee
communications whether on employee-owned devices or company-owned devices.

 



 

(xii) _Northeast Energy LP_. Except with respect to the first sentence of
_Section 5.5(a)_ and the entirety of _Section 5.5(b)_, to the extent the
Company makes any representation or warranty in _ARTICLE V_ regarding
Northeast Energy LP, such representation or warranty, solely to the extent it
regards Northeast Energy LP, shall be deemed to be qualified by the phrase "to
the Knowledge of the Company."

 



 

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly
drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. Further, prior drafts of this Agreement or any
ancillary agreements hereto or the fact that any clauses have been added,
deleted or otherwise modified from any prior drafts of this Agreement or any
ancillary agreements hereto shall not be used as an aide of construction or
otherwise constitute evidence of the intent of the parties hereto; and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
hereto by virtue of such prior drafts.

(a) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than ninety (90) days
following Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a certificate executed by
Purchasers Chief Financial Officer or equivalent executive officer (the " **
_Closing Certificate_** "), setting forth a good faith calculation, prepared
based upon the books and records of the Company and the Subsidiaries and in
accordance with applicable Accounting Policies and the methodology set forth
on _Exhibit C_, of (i) Net Working Capital (it being understood and agreed
that Net Working Capital shall be used to measure changes in Net Working
Capital and not as a form of indemnification and, in furtherance of the
foregoing, to the extent Purchaser asserts there is a current liability under
this _Section 3.3(a)_ that was not reflected in the calculation of the Target
Net Working Capital, the Target Net Working Capital shall be recalculated in
accordance with the definitions of Net Working Capital and Target Net Working
Capital and the methodology set forth on _Exhibit C_ to reflect such current
liability to the extent such current liability is included in the calculation
of Final Net Working Capital, _provided_ that, other than as described in the
foregoing, the Target Net Working Capital shall not be subject to
recalculation for any reason and may not be objected to or disputed by
Purchaser), (ii) any adjustments to Target Net Working Capital pursuant to
clause (i) above and the resultant adjustments to Estimated Net Working
Capital (which shall be recalculated to reflect such adjustments), (iii)
Closing Date Cash, (iv) Closing Date Indebtedness, (v) Seller Transaction
Expenses, (vi) Seller Severance Expenses, (vii) CapEx Spend Adjustment, (viii)
2016 Cash Flow Adjustment and (ix) the proposed Adjustment Amount based upon
such items. No actions taken by Purchaser on its own behalf or on behalf of
the Company, at or following Closing, shall be given effect for purposes of
determining the Final Net Working Capital. Purchaser shall not add items or
change any amounts in the Closing Certificate after it is delivered to Seller.
If the Adjustment Amount reflected in the Closing Certificate is positive,
Purchaser shall pay the Adjustment Amount to Seller by wire transfer of
immediately available funds into an account designated by Seller.

 



 

(b) After receipt of the Closing Certificate, Seller and its representatives
shall have reasonable access to all relevant books and records (including
accountant work papers), accountants, officers and employees of the Company
and the Subsidiaries solely for the purpose of reviewing the Closing
Certificate in accordance with this Agreement. If, within forty-five (45) days
following the delivery of the Closing Certificate, Seller has not given
Purchaser notice of its objection to any item in the Closing Certificate
reasonably detailing the basis of such objection (an " ** _Objection Notice_**
"), then the Closing Certificate shall be deemed final and binding on
Purchaser and Seller. If Seller delivers an Objection Notice, then Purchaser
and Seller shall consult in good faith to resolve the disputed items set forth
in the Objection Notice and, if any disputed items have not been resolved
within thirty (30) days following delivery of such notice, from and after such
time either Seller or Purchaser may submit the remaining disputed items to one
of PwC, EY or KPMG as agreed upon in writing by Seller and Purchaser or, if
such firm is unable to serve in such capacity, to such other nationally
recognized independent accounting firm that is mutually agreeable to Seller
and Purchaser (the " ** _Accountant_** ") or, if no such agreement can be
reached, Seller and Purchaser each shall, within ten (10) days thereof, select
a candidate for the Accountant and the two candidates so selected shall
promptly select a third nationally recognized independent accounting firm
which shall be appointed as the Accountant. The scope of the disputes to be
resolved by the Accountant shall be limited to fixing

 



      
 

 



 

mathematical errors and determining whether the items in dispute were
determined in accordance with the definitions of Cash and Cash Equivalents,
Indebtedness, Net Working Capital, Target Net Working Capital and Seller
Transaction Expenses and the methodology set forth on _Exhibit C_ without
regard to materiality, and the Accountant is not to make any other
determination and shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. If any
items in dispute are submitted to the Accountant for resolution: (x) Seller
and Purchaser shall use their respective Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
cause the Accountant to resolve all remaining disagreements with respect to
the Closing Certificate as soon as practicable but in any event shall direct
the Accountant to render a determination within ninety (90) days after its
retention; (y) Seller and Purchaser shall furnish to the Accountant and each
other such work papers and other documents and information relating solely to
the disputed issues as the Accountant may request and are available to that
party (including, in the case of Purchaser, the Company and the Subsidiaries
or their accountants), and shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the
Accountant any materials relating to the determination and to discuss the
determination with the Accountant, _provided_ , that copies of all such
materials are concurrently provided to the other party and that such
discussions may only occur in the presence (including by telephone) of the
other party, _provided_ , _further_ , that the Accountant shall consider only
those items and amounts which are identified as being in dispute; and (z) the
determination by the Accountant of the disputed items in the Closing
Certificate, as shall be set forth in a notice delivered to both parties by
the Accountant, shall be binding and conclusive on the parties. In resolving
any disputed item, the Accountant may not assign a value to any item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The fees of the
Accountant for such determination shall be borne by Purchaser, on the one
hand, and Seller, on the other hand, in proportion to the portion of the
aggregate amount in dispute that is finally resolved by the Accountant in a
manner adverse to such party. For example, if Purchaser claims the appropriate
adjustments are $1,000, and Seller contests $500 of the amount claimed by
Purchaser, and if the Accountant ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding
Purchaser $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the
Accountant will be allocated sixty percent (60%) (i.e., 300/500) to Seller and
forty percent (40%) (i.e., 200/500) to Purchaser.

 



 

(c) The Closing Date Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows (without
duplication): (i)(A) increased by the amount, if any, by which the Net Working
Capital, as finally determined (" ** _Final Net Working Capital_** "), is
greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital, as finally determined or (B)
reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Final Net Working Capital is less
than the Estimated Net Working Capital, as finally determined; (ii)(A)
increased by the amount, if any, by which the Closing Date Indebtedness, as
finally determined (" ** _Final Indebtedness_** "), is less than the Estimated
Closing Date Indebtedness or (B) reduced by the amount, if any, by which the
Final Indebtedness is greater than the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness;
(iii)(A) _increased_ by the amount, if any, by which the Closing Date Cash,
as finally determined (" ** _Final Cash_** "), is greater than the Estimated
Closing Date Cash or (B) _reduced_ by the amount, if any, by which the Final
Cash is less than the Estimated Closing Date Cash; (iv)(A) reduced by the
amount, if any, by which the Seller Transaction Expenses, as finally
determined (" ** _Final Seller Transaction Expenses_** "), are greater than
the Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses or (B) increased by the amount, if
any, by which the Final Seller

 



       
 

 



 

Transaction Expenses are less than the Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses;
(v)(A) increased by the amount, if any, by which the Seller Severance
Expenses, as finally determined (" ** _Final Seller Severance Expenses_** "),
are greater than the Estimated Seller Severance Expenses or (B) decreased by
the amount, if any, by which the Final Seller Severance Expenses are less than
the Estimated Seller Severance Expenses; (vi) _increased_ by the amount, if
any, by which the CapEx Spend Adjustment, as finally determined (" ** _Final
CapEx Spend Adjustment_** "), is greater than the Estimated CapEx Spend
Adjustment or (B) _reduced_ by the amount, if any, by which the Final CapEx
Spend Adjustment is less than the Estimated CapEx Spend Adjustment; and (vii)
_increased_ by the amount, if any, by which the 2016 Cash Flow Adjustment, as
finally determined (" ** _Final 2016 Cash Flow Adjustment_** "), is greater
than the Estimated 2016 Cash Flow Adjustment or (B) _reduced_ by the amount,
if any, by which the Final 2016 Cash Flow Adjustment is less than the
Estimated 2016 Cash Flow Adjustment.

 



 

(d) No later than the second Business Day following the final determination of
the Adjustment Amount:

 



 

(i) if the Adjustment Amount is greater than the amount (if any) actually paid
by Purchaser pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 3.3(a)_, Purchaser
shall pay such positive Adjustment Amount (less the portion already paid to
Seller pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 3.3(a)_) to Seller by wire
transfer of immediately available funds into the account designated by Seller;
or

 



 

(ii) if the Adjustment Amount is negative, Seller shall pay the absolute value
of such negative Adjustment Amount to Purchaser by wire transfer of
immediately available funds into the account designated by Purchaser.

 



 

(e) The Adjustment Amount shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price for income Tax purposes.

under this Agreement, the Related Documents or the Related Claims, in each
case, whether arising before or after such termination, and such termination

 _further_ , that the obligations of the parties set forth in _Section 4.4_,
_Section 4.5_, _Section 8.6_, _Section 8.8_ and _ARTICLE XI_ shall survive

4.5 _Reverse Termination Fee_.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated: (i) by Purchaser or Seller pursuant to
_Section 4.3(c)_ (if, and only if, the applicable Order giving rise to such
termination arises in connection with FERCs approval of the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to Section 203 of the Federal Power Act, the
approval of the transactions contemplated hereby by the Public Utility
Commission of Texas or in connection with the condition set forth in _Section
9.1(d)_ and _Section 9.2(d)_); (ii) by Purchaser or Seller pursuant to
_Section 4.3(a)_ and, in the case of this clause (ii), at the time of such
termination, FERCs approval of the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant
to Section 203 of the Federal Power Act has not been obtained, the approval of
the transactions contemplated hereby by the Public Utility Commission of Texas
has not been obtained or the condition set forth in _Sections 9.1(d)_ or
_9.2(d)_ has not been satisfied; (iii) by Seller pursuant to _Section
4.3(d)_, and in each case of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), at the
time of such termination, all of the conditions set forth in _Sections 9.1(a)_
, _9.1(b)_ , _9.1(c)_ (except for any nonsatisfaction arising in connection
with FERCs approval of the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to
Section 203 of the Federal Power Act, the approval of the transactions
contemplated hereby by the Public Utility Commission of Texas or in connection
with the condition set forth in _Section 9.1(d)_), _9.1(e)_ (other than the
receipt of FERCs approval of the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to
Section 203 of the Federal Power Act or the approval of the transactions
contemplated hereby by the Public Utility Commission of Texas), _9.1(f)_ ,
_9.1(g)_ and _9.1(h)_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing and are
capable of being satisfied assuming a Closing would occur); or (iv) by Seller
pursuant to _Section 4.3(f)_, then Purchaser shall pay to the Company or its
designee a fee in an amount equal to $132,000,000 (the " ** _Reverse
Termination Fee_** ") in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated by the Company. The Reverse Termination Fee shall be
paid no later than three (3) Business Days after any such notice of
termination of this Agreement. If Purchaser fails to promptly pay the Reverse
Termination Fee when due pursuant to this _Section 4.5(a)_, then interest
shall accrue on the amount of the Reverse Termination Fee from the date such
payment was required to be paid

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until the date of payment at a rate
per annum equal to the prime rate as published in the _Wall Street Journal,
Eastern Edition_ in effect from time to time during such period. In addition,
if Purchaser fails to pay the Reverse Termination Fee when due, Purchaser also
shall pay to the Company all of Sellers and the Companys costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with efforts to collect
the Reverse Termination Fee and interest thereon.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that (i) the agreements
contained in this _Section 4.5_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that, without such agreements, Seller and
the Company would not enter into this Agreement and (ii) payment by Purchaser
of the Reverse Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather a reasonable
amount that will compensate Seller and the Company for the efforts and
resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement, relying on this Agreement and expecting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision. Without in any way limiting the Companys rights
set forth in _Section 4.5(c)_, the parties agree that, in the event that this
Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which the Reverse Termination
Fee is payable, the Reverse Termination Fee (together with the interest
obligations and cost and expense reimbursement obligations set forth in
_Section 4.5(a)_) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller, the
Company and their respective Affiliates and equity holders against (A)
Purchaser, (B) the former, current and future holders of any equity interest
in or the controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
representatives, attorneys, Affiliates, stockholders or assignees of
Purchaser, (C) any future holders of any equity interest or any future
controlling person, director, officer, employee, agent, attorney,
representative, Affiliate or stockholder of any of the foregoing or (D) any
Financing Source or Sponsor (the Persons described in clauses (A), (B), (C)
and (D) above, collectively, the " ** _Purchaser Group_** "), for any Loss
suffered by Seller, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates based
upon or arising out of this Agreement, the Related Documents, the Related
Claims or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
abandonment or termination of this Agreement, the Related Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby). Further, upon payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee and, if applicable, the interest, costs and expenses required
pursuant to _Section 4.5(a)_, the Purchaser Group shall have no further
liability to Seller, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates or
equity holders based upon or arising out of this Agreement, the Related
Documents, the Related Claims or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the abandonment or termination of this Agreement, the
Related Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Purchaser fails to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement after satisfaction
or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.1_ in breach of
Purchasers obligations under this Agreement, Seller may, in its sole
discretion: (i) seek specific performance pursuant to _Section 11.11_; (ii)
withdraw any claim for specific performance, terminate this Agreement under
_Section 4.3(f)_, if otherwise permitted to do so, and seek payment of the
Reverse Termination Fee; or (iii) terminate this Agreement under _Section
4.3(f)_, if otherwise permitted to do so, and

 



      
 

 



 

seek payment of the Reverse Termination Fee; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall Seller or the Company be entitled to both a grant of specific
performance and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee.

8.1(a)_, Purchaser shall be permitted, through its officers, employees and
representatives (including its legal advisors, accountants and Financing
Sources), to investigate and examine the properties, businesses and
operations, and the books and records, of the Company and the Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to investigation and examination of
properties, businesses and operations, such investigation and examination is

shall cause the officers, employees, consultants, agents, accountants,
attorneys and other representatives of the Company and the Subsidiaries to

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably cooperate with Purchaser and Purchasers representatives in
connection with such investigation and examination. Purchaser and Purchasers
representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as to
minimize any disruption to, and to not interfere unreasonably with, the
business or operations of the Company or the Subsidiaries or the prompt and
timely discharge by the employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries of their
normal duties. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no such
investigation or examination shall be permitted to the extent that it would

disclosable for any reason (including information that will be transferred out
of the Company Group prior to Closing pursuant to the terms of _Exhibit B_),
(ii) information regarding the Excluded Legal Proceeding; _provided_ that the
Company shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed of all material developments
with respect to the Excluded Legal Proceedings, or (iii) information subject

Commercially Reasonable Efforts to disclose such information (or as much as
possible) in a manner that does not result in the loss of attorney-client
privilege. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, prior to the
Closing, without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Purchaser shall not
contact any employee (excluding employees listed on _Schedule 8.1(a)_ ),
director, independent contractor distributor, suppliers to, or customers of,
the Company in connection with transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and Purchaser shall have no right to perform invasive or subsurface
investigations of the properties or facilities of the Company or any of the

become commingled with books and records of Purchaser and its Affiliates), and
personnel and representatives of the Company Group, as may be reasonably
required by Seller including to the extent necessary for the preparation of
financial statements, regulatory filings or Tax Returns of Seller or its
Affiliates in respect of periods ending on or prior to Closing, or in

agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby. Seller, its
Affiliates and its and their representatives shall be entitled to make copies
of, and conduct searches with respect to or in order to identify, the books
and records to which such Persons are entitled to access pursuant to this

hours upon reasonable advance notice and under reasonable circumstances, and
shall be subject to restrictions under applicable Law and any confidentiality
obligations to which the Company or any of its Affiliates are bound. Purchaser
agrees that it shall preserve and keep the books and records held by
Purchaser, the Company or their respective Affiliates relating to the
respective businesses of the Company and the Subsidiaries prior to the Closing
for a period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date. In the event

such books and records after that time, Purchaser shall first give 90 days
prior written notice to Seller

 



      
 

 



 

and Seller shall have the right at its option and expense, upon prior written
notice given to Purchaser within that 90 day period, to take possession of
such books and records within 180 days after the date of such notice. In
exercising its access rights with respect to books and records pursuant to
this _Section 8.1(b)_, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its
and their representatives to, use reasonable care to preserve the condition
of, and not to destroy or render unusable in any manner, such books and
records. Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and representatives to:
(i) keep all information and books and records accessed pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(b)_ confidential, (ii) not publicly disclose such information or
books and records to any other Person (except where such disclosure, upon the
advice of outside counsel, is required by applicable Law and only to the
extent required by applicable Law) and (iii) not use such information or books

and (iii) cooperate with each other in connection with any such filing

Purchaser shall consult and coordinate with Seller and the Company to file or
cause to be filed, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than 30

officers, or directors of the recipient, unless express written permission is

any other United States federal or state or foreign statutes, rules,
regulations, Orders, administrative or judicial doctrines or other Laws that
are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, the " **
_Regulatory Laws_** "). In connection therewith, if any Legal Proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as in violation of any Regulatory Law, each of
Purchaser, Seller and the Company shall cooperate and use its reasonable best
efforts to contest and resist any such Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed, or overturned any Order whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts

is not in their respective best interests. Each of Purchaser, Seller and the
Company shall take any and all actions as may be required to cause the

of this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each
of Purchaser, Seller and the Company agree to take promptly any and all steps
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Regulatory
Laws that may be asserted by any federal, state and local and non-United
States antitrust or competition authority, so as to enable the parties to
close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as
possible, including effecting or committing to effect, by consent decree, hold
separate orders, trust or otherwise (i) the sale or disposition of such of its
assets or businesses as are required to be divested and (ii) any other
restriction, limitation or encumbrance on the businesses or assets of the
Purchaser or the Company Group, in order to avoid the entry of, or to
effectuate the dissolution of, any Order in any suit or preceding, that would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the
contrary, (A) neither Seller nor its Affiliates shall be required to undertake
any actions to resolve any objections asserted by any Governmental Body with
respect to any Regulatory Laws other than actions related to the Business and
(B) Purchaser shall not be required to undertake any actions to resolve any
objections asserted by any Governmental Body with respect to obtaining the
approval set forth in Item 7 of _Schedule 5.3(b)_.

Company and Seller in accordance with this _Section 8.4_ (except for fees of

8.5 _Further Assurances._

 



 

(a) Subject to, and not in limitation of, _Section 8.4_, each of Purchaser,
Seller and the Company shall use (and the Company shall cause each of the
Subsidiaries to use) its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to, and the parties
shall reasonably cooperate with one another to, (a) take all actions necessary
or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(b) cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the
conditions to their respective obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (c) execute and cause to be delivered to
each other party hereto such instruments and other documents, and shall take
such other actions, as such other party may reasonably request (prior to, at
or after the Closing) for the purposes of carrying out or evidencing any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) If at any time or from time to time following the Closing, any party (or
any member of such partys respective Group), shall receive or otherwise
possess any asset or liability that is allocated to any other Person pursuant
to this Agreement or any Related Document (including in connection with the
Reorganization), such Person (or any member of such partys respective Group,
the " ** _Transferor Party_** ") shall promptly transfer, or cause to be
transferred, such asset (each, a " ** _Non-Transferred Asset_** ") or
liability (each, a " ** _Non-Transferred Liability_** "), as the case may be,
to the Person (or any member of such partys respective Group, the " **
_Transferee Party_** ") entitled to such Non-Transferred Asset or responsible
for such Non-Transferred Liability, as the case may be, and the Transferee
Party entitled to such Non-Transferred Asset or responsible for such Non-
Transferred Liability shall accept such Non-Transferred Asset or accept,
assume and agree faithfully to perform or discharge such Non-Transferred
Liability, as applicable. If any transfer or assignment of any Non-Transferred
Asset under this _Section 8.5(b)_ is unable to be consummated promptly for
any reason, then, insofar as reasonably possible, the Transferor Party
retaining such Non-Transferred Asset, shall thereafter hold such Non-
Transferred Asset for the use and benefit of the Transferee Party entitled
thereto (at the expense of the Transferee Party entitled thereto). In
addition, the Transferor Party retaining such Non-Transferred Asset shall,
insofar as reasonably possible and to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
treat such Non-Transferred Asset in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice and take such other actions as may be reasonably requested
by the Transferee Party to whom such Non-Transferred Asset is to be
transferred or assigned, in order to place such Transferee Party in a
substantially similar position as if such Non-Transferred Asset had been
transferred as contemplated hereby and so that all the benefits and burdens
relating to such Non-Transferred Asset, including use, risk of loss, potential
for gain, and dominion, control and command over such Non-Transferred Asset,
is to inure from and after the Closing to the Transferee Party. The reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses associated with any such transfers or
assignments of Non-Transferred Assets or assumption of Non-Transferred
Liabilities, including reasonable attorneys fees and all recording or similar
fees, shall be borne by the party that would have been responsible for such
costs and expenses if the transfer, assignment or assumption had occurred at
or prior to the Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

8.6 _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) As used in this _Section 8.6_, the term " ** _Confidential Information_**
" means all or any part of the information, data or knowledge (in whatever
form communicated or maintained, whether documentary, computer or other

Agreement; and (iii) without limiting the foregoing, not disclose the
Confidential Information to any Person, except with Sellers written consent.

Closing with respect to that portion of the Confidential Information that
relates primarily to the Company Group.

 



 

(c) The restrictions set forth in _Section 8.6(b)_ do not apply to that part
of the Confidential Information that (i) becomes available to the public other
than as a result of a breach of this _Section 8.6_ by Purchaser, its
Affiliates or its representatives, (ii) is required to be disclosed by
applicable Laws, provided that in such event, Purchaser comply with the
procedure set forth in _Section 8.6(d)_ below, or (iii) is disclosed to
Purchasers Affiliates, the Sponsors or their respective representatives (each
of whom shall be advised by Purchaser of this confidentiality obligation) in
each case, on a need to know basis and who agree to treat such information
confidentially. Further, the restrictions set forth in _Section 8.6(b)_ shall
not prevent Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or representatives from
disclosing any Confidential Information (A) under, and subject to, customary
confidentiality agreements, to any Financing Source in connection with any
Financing Transaction (including to perform any diligence with respect to, or
confirm the accuracy of, the Required Financial Information), (B) in an
offering circular, prospectus, bank book or private placement memorandum in
connection with any Financing Transaction, (C) in connection with any public
filing requirement or (D) for the purposes of establishing a "due diligence"
defense in connection with any Financing Transaction, as applicable.

 



 

(d) If Purchaser is required by Law or in any Legal Proceeding to make any
disclosure that is prohibited by this _Section 8.6_, Purchaser shall, to the
extent legally permissible, provide Seller with reasonably prompt notice of
such requirement so that Seller may seek, at its sole cost and expense, an
appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance
with the provisions of this _Section 8.6_. In the absence of a protective
order or other

 



      
 

 



 

remedy, Purchaser may disclose that portion (and only that portion) of the
Confidential Information that, based upon the opinion of its counsel,
Purchaser is legally required to disclose; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Purchaser shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain assurance
that any Person or entity to whom any Confidential Information is so disclosed
shall accord confidential treatment to the Confidential Information.

 



 

(e) The parties hereto agree that this _Section 8.6_ supersedes the
confidentiality agreement by and between Dynegy Inc. and GDF SUEZ Energy
Development NA, Inc. dated September 28, 2015, in all respects, and Seller and
the Company shall cause GDF SUEZ Energy Development NA, Inc. to abide by this
_Section 8.6(e)_ as if it were a party hereto.

 



 

8.7 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the Company and the
Subsidiaries to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, including contractual indemnification and
under the respective certificate of incorporation, bylaws or comparable
organizational documents of the Company or such Subsidiary in effect on the
date hereof, the individuals who on or prior to the Closing Date were
directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " ** _Indemnitees_** ") with respect to all acts or
omissions by them in their capacities as such or as trustees or fiduciaries of
any plan for the benefit of employees of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries or taken at the request of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
at any time prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser agrees that all rights of the
Indemnitees to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date as provided in the
respective certificate of incorporation or bylaws or comparable organizational
documents of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries as now in effect, and any
indemnification agreements or arrangements of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms. Purchaser shall not permit the
Company or any Subsidiary to amend, or otherwise modify such rights or
agreements in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the
Indemnitees, unless such modification is required by Law. In addition,
Purchaser shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to pay any and all
legal and other fees, costs and expenses (including the cost of investigation
and preparation) of any Indemnitee under this _Section 8.7_, as incurred and
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and the respective
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or comparable organizational documents of
the Company or such Subsidiary in effect on the date hereof, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by applicable Law
and the applicable certificate of incorporation, bylaws or comparable
organizational documents of the Company or such Subsidiary in effect on the
date hereof. Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid all fees, costs and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by an
Indemnitee in enforcing this _Section 8.7_.

 



 

(b) For the six-year period commencing immediately following the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall cause the Company or the Subsidiaries to maintain their
current respective directors and officers liability insurance, if any,
covering acts or omissions occurring prior to

 



      
 

 



 

the Closing Date with respect to those persons who are covered immediately
prior to the Closing Date by the Companys or the Subsidiaries directors and
officers liability insurance policy on terms with respect to such coverage
and amount no less favorable to the Companys or the Subsidiaries directors
and officers currently covered by such insurance than those of such policy in
effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser may cause
the Company or the Subsidiaries, as applicable, to substitute therefor
policies of a reputable insurance company the terms of which, including
coverage and amount, are no less favorable to such directors and officers than
the insurance coverage otherwise required under this _Section 8.7(b)_; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that Purchaser may elect to cause the Company or the
Subsidiaries to purchase at or after the Closing Date, in lieu of the
foregoing insurance, a directors and officers liability insurance "tail" or
"runoff" insurance program (the " ** _Tail Policy_** ") to be in effect until
the end of such six-year period (and for so long thereafter as any claim is
being adjudicated thereunder) with respect to acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Closing Date (such coverage to be on terms and conditions and for
an amount no less favorable to the Companys or the Subsidiaries directors
and officers currently covered by such insurance than those of such policy in
effect on the date hereof).

 



 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 8.7_: (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives; (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person
may have by Contract or otherwise; and (iii) shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnitee to whom this
_Section 8.7_ applies without the consent of the affected Indemnitee.

 



 

(d) In the event that Purchaser or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Purchaser shall assume all of the
obligations of Purchaser set forth in this _Section 8.7_.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim (whether
arising before, at or after the Closing) is made against any Person covered by
the Tail Policy on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Closing, the
provisions of this _Section 8.7_ shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such claim.

 



 

8.8 _Publicity_.

 



 

(a) None of Seller, the Company and the Subsidiaries or Purchaser, or any
Affiliates of the foregoing, shall issue any press release or public
announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
without obtaining the prior written approval of the other parties hereto,
which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless, in the
sole judgment of Seller, the Company or Purchaser, as applicable, disclosure
is otherwise required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules of any
stock exchange on which Seller, the Company or Purchaser lists securities,
_provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent required by

 



      
 

 



 

applicable Law, the party intending to make such release shall use its
Commercially Reasonable Efforts consistent with such applicable Law to consult
with the other party with respect to the timing and content thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the prior written approval of any party
hereto, the ECP Sponsors and their Affiliates may disclose customary
information to investors or potential investors or to their respective
Affiliates who are subject to customary confidentiality obligations.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, and subject to applicable Law, (i) prior
to Closing, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not publicly disclose (whether
in a press release, public announcement, securities disclosure or otherwise)
anything regarding the Excluded Legal Proceedings, and (ii) from and after
Closing, Purchaser, the Company Group and their respective Affiliates shall
not publicly disclose (whether in a press release, public announcement,
securities disclosure or otherwise) anything regarding the Excluded Legal
Proceedings without first consulting with Seller regarding such disclosure and
obtaining the prior written consent from Seller with respect to the form,
substance and timing of such disclosure.

 



 

8.9 _Use of Name_. Purchaser agrees that it: (a) shall have no right to use
the name or term "ENGIE" or "GDF" or "Suez" or "International Power" or
"Tractebel" or any service marks, trademarks, trade names, identifying
symbols, logos, emblems, signs, insignia or domain names related thereto or

domain name confusingly similar to any of the foregoing (collectively, the "
** _Subject Marks_** "); and (b) will not at any time hold itself out as
having any affiliation with ENGIE S.A. (formerly known as GDF SUEZ S.A.) or
any of its Affiliates. As promptly as practicable but in no event later than
90 days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall (i) remove, strike over or
otherwise obliterate all Subject Marks from all materials including any
vehicles, facilities, business cards, schedules, stationery, packaging
materials, displays, signs, promotional materials, manuals, forms, computer
software or other materials and (ii) cease all use of the Subject Marks.

 



 

8.10 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and consummate the Debt Financing on the terms
and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter (including the flex
provisions set forth in the Fee Letter), including (i) using reasonable best
efforts to (w) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter, (x) satisfy on a
timely basis all terms, covenants and conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter (including, to the extent the same are exercised, the flex
provisions set forth in the Fee Letter), (y) enter into definitive agreements
with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (including, to the extent the same are exercised, the flex
provisions set forth in the Fee Letter) and (z) consummate the Debt Financing
at or prior to Closing and (ii) enforcing its rights under the Debt Commitment
Letter.

 



 

(b) Except as contemplated by the Fee Letter, Purchaser shall not permit any
amendment, modification or waiver of the Debt Commitment Letter that (i)
reduces the amount of aggregate cash proceeds available from the Debt
Financing below the amount necessary to

 



      
 

 



 

finance the transactions to be consummated on the Closing Date unless the
Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount or (ii) imposes new or
additional conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, in each of the
cases of clauses (i) and (ii), in a manner that would reasonably be expected
to delay or prevent the Closing (it being understood and agreed the Purchaser
may, without the consent of the Seller, (A) amend or otherwise modify the Debt
Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter
as of the date of this Agreement or (B) amend or modify the Debt Commitment
Letter to implement the flex provisions set forth in the Fee Letter).

 



 

(c) Until the earlier of the Closing and such time as this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall cooperate (or cause
its Subsidiaries to cooperate) in connection with the Debt Financing, any
other financings undertaken by Purchaser or its Affiliates in substitution for
or in addition thereto for the purpose of funding the purchase of the Shares
or any offerings that are registered under the Purchasers (or its direct or
indirect parents) existing or future shelf registration statements on Form
S-3 (each, a " ** _Financing Transaction_** ") and, in each case, as may be
reasonably requested by Purchaser, at Purchasers sole cost and expense,
including (i) assisting Purchaser and each agent, arranger, lender, investor,
potential agent, potential arranger, potential lender, potential investor,
underwriter, initial purchaser and placement agent providing or potentially
providing, or acting in connection with, any Financing Transaction, or any
Affiliate of such Person (each of the foregoing, and each of its respective
officers, controlling persons, directors, employees, agents, counsel and
representative or any respective successors and assigns, a " ** _Financing
Source_** ") in the preparation of customary (A) offering documents, private
placement memoranda and bank information memoranda and similar marketing
documents (including providing such information and data in connection
therewith as Purchaser shall reasonably request), including the execution and
delivery of customary representation letters in connection with bank
information memoranda authorizing the distribution of information to
prospective lenders and identifying any portion of such information that
constitutes material, non-public information regarding the Business and (B)
materials for rating agency presentations, (ii) cooperating with the marketing
efforts for each Financing Transaction, including participating in a
reasonable number of customary meetings, presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions (including accounting due diligence sessions), drafting
sessions and sessions with prospective lenders, initial purchasers, investors
and rating agencies, including direct contact with senior management of the
Company (and other employees with appropriate seniority and expertise) and
advisors, in each case, at times and locations to be mutually agreed upon,
(iii) furnishing all financial statements, financial data, audit reports and
such other financial information, including the Required Financial
Information, regarding the Business of the type and form required by
Regulation S-K (including, without limitation, Item 303 Managements
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and
Item 301 Selected Financial Data; provided that such Selected Financial Data
shall not include any information for any period prior to the year ended
December 31, 2013) and Regulation S-X under the Securities Act for offerings
of non-convertible debt securities on a registration statement on Form S-1,
but in each case limited to (a) the type and form customarily included in a
private placement of debt securities pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated under
the

 



      
 

 



 

Securities Act, which for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be required to
include "segment reporting," information required by Regulation S-X Rule 3-09,
Regulation S-X Rule 3-10, Regulation S-X Rule 3-16 and Item 402 of Regulation
S-K, and information regarding executive compensation or projections or pro
forma financial statements, which shall be the responsibility of Purchaser, to
consummate an offering of debt securities incurred to provide funds to
consummate the purchase of the Shares and (b) the type and form customarily
included in offering documents used to syndicate credit facilities of the type
to be included in the Debt Financing, (iv) causing the independent
accountants of the Company to provide assistance and cooperation, including
providing customary consents and comfort letters in connection with any
Financing Transaction, (v) cooperating, to the extent the satisfaction of such
condition requires the cooperation of, or is within the control of, the
Company and its Subsidiaries in satisfying the conditions precedent set forth
in any definitive document relating to any Financing Transaction and (vi) upon
request, furnishing any documentation and other information required by a
Governmental Body under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Purchaser shall,
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or their
respective Affiliates in connection with such cooperation. Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, any of the Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates, and each of their representatives from and against any
and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement
of the Debt Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than information provided by the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or
their respective Affiliates). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) nothing
contained in this _Section 8.10(c)_ shall require cooperation with Purchaser
to the extent it would materially and unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
customary operations of the business of the Company, any of the Subsidiaries,
or any of their respective Affiliates (provided that, the delivery of Required
Financial Information and the information required by Item 303 Managements
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of
Regulation S-K shall not constitute such interference), encumber any of the
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to Closing, or require
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other fee or
make any other payment in connection with the Financing prior to the Closing
Date and (y) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective directors or officers, shall (A) be required to take any action in
the capacity as a member of the board of directors of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to authorize or approve the Financing, (B) have any liability
or any obligation under any definitive agreement or any other agreement or
document related to the Financing (except with respect to any customary
authorization letters contemplated by this _Section 8.10(c)_) or (C) enter
into any definitive agreement in connection with the Financing Transaction (or
Alternate Financing), in each case, that would be effective prior to the
Closing Date.

 



 

(d) Purchaser shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to keep the
Company reasonably informed with respect to the status of the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and shall give the Company prompt
notice of any material adverse change with respect to the availability of the
Debt Financing. Without limiting the foregoing,

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any event within two
(2) Business Days, if at any time (i) the Debt Commitment Letter shall expire
or be terminated for any reason, (ii) any Financing Source that is a party to
the Debt Commitment Letter notifies Purchaser that such Financing Source no
longer intends to provide financing to Purchaser on the terms set forth
therein, or (iii) for any reason Purchaser no longer believes in good faith
that it will be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms described therein.
Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, without
the prior written consent of the Company, take or fail to take any action or
enter into any transaction, including any merger, acquisition, joint venture,
disposition, Contract or debt or equity financing, that could reasonably be
expected to materially impair, delay or prevent consummation of the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or any Alternate
Financing contemplated by any New Debt Commitment Letter.

 



 

(e) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter (including the flex
provisions set forth in the Fee Letter) or the Debt Commitment Letter shall be
terminated or modified in a manner materially adverse to Purchaser for any
reason, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder (" ** _Alternate
Financing_** ") and to obtain, and, if obtained, will provide the Company with
a correct and complete copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for
at least the same amount of financing as the Debt Commitment Letter as
originally issued, to the extent needed to fund the transactions contemplated
hereby (the " ** _New Debt Commitment Letter_** "). To the extent applicable,
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions necessary, proper or advisable to arrange promptly and consummate
the Alternate Financing on the terms and conditions described in any New Debt
Commitment Letter, including (i) using reasonable best efforts to (x) satisfy
on a timely basis all terms, covenants and conditions set forth in the New
Debt Commitment Letter, (y) enter into definitive agreements with respect
thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the New Debt Commitment
Letter and (z) consummate the Alternate Financing at or prior to the Closing
and (ii) enforcing its rights under the New Debt Commitment Letter. In the
event Alternate Financing is obtained and a New Debt Commitment Letter is
entered into, references in this Agreement to the Debt Commitment Letter shall
be deemed to refer to the New Debt Commitment Letter, as applicable.

 



 

(f) " ** _Required Financial Information_** " means (i) audited financial
statements, including combined balance sheets, statements of operations,
statements of cash flows and statements of stockholders equity, of the
Business as of and for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 as
required by, and in compliance with GAAP, (ii) unaudited financial statements,
including combined balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of
cash flows, of the Business as of and for each subsequent fiscal quarter
(other than the fourth quarter) ended at least forty-five (45) days prior to
the earlier of the Closing Date and the Financing Completion Date, which shall
have been reviewed by the independent accountants for the Business as provided
in the procedures specified by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
in AU 722; provided, that if the Businesss independent accountants shall have

 



      
 

 



 

withdrawn or announced their intention to restate their audit opinion with
respect to any of the audited financial statements of the Business for any of
the fiscal years ending December 31, 2013, December 31, 2014 or December 31,
2015, the Required Financial Information shall not be deemed to be provided
for purposes of clause (i) of this definition until such time as a new audit
opinion has been issued with respect to such audited financial statements by
such independent accountants or another independent accounting firm reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if the Company shall in good faith reasonably believe that it has
delivered, or caused to be delivered, the Required Financial Information
and/or the information contemplated by _Section 8.10(c)_(iii), then the
Company may deliver to Purchaser written notice to that effect (stating when
it believes it completed the applicable delivery), in which case the Required
Financial Information and/or the information contemplated by _Section
8.10(c)_(iii), as applicable, shall be deemed to have been delivered on the
date of the applicable notice, in each case unless Purchaser in good faith
reasonably believes that the Company shall have not completed delivery of the
Required Financial Information or the information contemplated by _Section
8.10(c)_(iii), as applicable, and, within three Business Days after its
receipt of such notice from the Company, Purchaser delivers a written notice
to the Company to that effect (stating with specificity the Required Financial
Information or the information contemplated by _Section 8.10(c)_(iii), as
applicable, that has not been delivered).

 



 

(g) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and
conditions of the Equity Commitment Letters, Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Equity Financing contemplated by the
Equity Commitment Letters simultaneously with the receipt of the Debt
Financing, (ii) maintain in effect the Equity Commitment Letters, (iii)
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Purchaser set forth in
the Equity Commitment Letters that are within its control and (iv) consummate
the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letters at or prior
to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Purchaser be
required to waive any condition set forth in _Section 9.1_.

 



 

(h) Purchaser shall not amend, alter or waive, or agree to amend, alter or
waive (in any case whether by action or inaction), any term of the Equity
Commitment Letters without the prior written consent of the Company or except
as permitted pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letters. Purchaser shall
promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) notify the Company of
(i) the expiration or termination (or attempted or purported termination,
whether or not valid) of any Equity Commitment Letter, or (ii) any refusal by
a Sponsor named in an Equity Commitment Letter to provide the full financing
contemplated by such Equity Commitment Letter.

 



 

8.11 _Employment and Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser shall provide or shall cause to be provided to each Continuing
Employee, for a period of 18 months following the Closing Date, (i) a base
wage or salary that is no less favorable than the base wage or salary in
effect for such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date,
(ii) target incentive compensation opportunities (including equity-based
incentive compensation opportunities) that are no less favorable in the

 



      
 

 



 

aggregate than those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Closing Date; _provided_ that, with respect to long-term incentive
compensation opportunities, compliance with _Sections 8.11(d)(ii) (iv) shall
be deemed compliance with this Section 8.11(a)(ii)_, and (iii) employee
benefits (including without limitation retirement, health, welfare, vacation
and all other fringe benefits and taking into account the value of the
employer matching contribution provided under the Companys 401(k) Plan) that
are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to similarly
situated employees of the Affiliates of Purchaser.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall (i) waive any applicable
pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements in any successor employee benefit plan
of the Purchaser or its Affiliate that a Continuing Employee is eligible to
participate in following the Closing Date to the extent such exclusions or
waiting periods were inapplicable to, or had been satisfied by, such employee
prior to the Closing Date under an analogous Company Benefit Plan, (ii) cause
any eligible expenses incurred by a Continuing Employee and such employees
covered dependents under any Company Benefit Plan during the portion of the
plan year ending on the date such employees participation in any successor
employee benefit plan of the Purchaser or its Affiliates begins to be taken
into account under such successor plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such
amounts had been paid under the same plan and (iii) cause each employee
benefit plan of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates following the Closing Date
to recognize and credit the service of each Continuing Employee with the
Company and the Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date to the same extent as
such Continuing Employee was entitled, immediately prior to the Closing Date,
to credit for such service under any Company Benefit Plan for purposes of
eligibility to participate, determination of level of benefits, vesting,
vacation entitlement and severance benefits (but not for benefit accrual under
any defined benefit plan); _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to
the extent it would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period
of service.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.11(a)_, from and after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall retain, honor and continue all of the Companys
obligations and responsibilities in respect of all Continuing Employees (i)
arising under the terms of the Company Sale Severance Plan (it being
understood that in the event that a Continuing Employee becomes entitled to
benefits under the Company Sale Severance Plan, such individual shall be
entitled to payments and benefits under both the Company Sale Severance Plan
and Severance Pay Plan), the Severance Pay Plan, the 2016 Short-Term Incentive
Plan, the 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the 2015-Long Term Incentive Plan,
the 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan and, if in effect from and after the
Closing, the SUEZ Energy North America, Inc. Senior Management Deferred
Compensation Plan, in each case, in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) except as otherwise provided in
_Section 8.11(e)_, accrued, unused vacation and other paid time off benefits
accrued as of the Closing Date, and (iii) as provided in _Exhibit B_ with
respect to the Companys 401(k) plan. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall
take all actions reasonably necessary to provide that, subject to _Section
8.11(d)_, Purchaser shall not retain, and, at and after the Closing, the
Company and the

 



       
 

 



 

Company Group shall not retain any other Company Benefit Plan or any other
compensation or benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained by
the Company or any ERISA Affiliate (or to which the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate contributes or is required to contribute).

and conditions for payment under such plan as in effect immediately prior to
the Closing Date, the incentive payment that would have been payable under
such plan assuming achievement of 120% of applicable performance targets under
such plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that if a participant experiences a

calculated assuming achievement of 175% of applicable performance targets
under such plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that if a participant experiences a
Qualifying Termination on or following the Closing Date but prior to December
31, 2016, such participants incentive payment shall be governed by the terms
of the Company Sale Severance Plan;

 



 

(iii) in the event that the Closing Date occurs on or prior to March 15, 2018,

calculated assuming achievement of 150% of applicable performance targets
under such plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that if a participant experiences a
Qualifying Termination on or following the Closing Date but prior to December
31, 2017, such participants incentive payment shall be governed by the terms
of the Company Sale Severance Plan; and

 



 

(iv) in the event that the Closing Date occurs on or prior to March 15, 2019,

as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, an incentive payment
calculated assuming achievement of 150% of applicable performance targets
under such plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that if a

 



      
 

 



 

participant experiences a Qualifying Termination on or following the Closing
Date but prior to December 31, 2018, such participants incentive payment
shall be governed by the terms of the Company Sale Severance Plan.

 



 

(e) Seller shall make, or shall cause its Affiliates to make, a payment as of
Closing to each Continuing Employee in full satisfaction of any accrued but
unused vacation in excess of 40 hours credited to such Continuing Employee as
of immediately before the Closing such that, as of the Closing, the Continuing
Employee shall be credited with no accrued but unused vacation in excess of 40
hours in respect of employment by the Company or its Affiliates.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this _Section 8.11_ shall (i) create any right in any
Continuing Employee or other employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries to
continued employment by Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof or (ii) require
Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof to continue any Company Benefit Plan or
prevent the amendment, modification or termination of any Company Benefit Plan
after the Closing Date. Nothing in this _Section 8.11_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be construed as an amendment to any benefit plan of the
Company, the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates.

 



 

8.12 _Disclosure Schedules; Supplementation and Amendment of Schedules_. From
time to time prior to the Closing, the Company may deliver updates to the
disclosure schedules that are necessary to complete or correct any
representation or warranty of the Company or Seller that has been rendered
inaccurate or incomplete due solely to any change, event, effect or occurrence
since the date of this Agreement (each such update, a " ** _Schedule Update_**
"). If (a) Purchaser would have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 4.3(e)_ as a result of any change, event, effect or occurrence
set forth in a Schedule Update and does not exercise such right within twenty
(20) Business Days thereof and (b) such Schedule Update relates solely to
changes, events, effects or occurrences arising after the date of this
Agreement, then such Schedule Update shall be deemed to have amended the
disclosure schedules as of the date of this Agreement, to have qualified the
representations and warranties contained in _ARTICLE V_ and _ARTICLE VI_, as
the case may be, as of the date of this Agreement, and to have cured any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty that otherwise might have existed
hereunder by reason of the existence of any such change, event, effect or
occurrence. Seller and the Company, as applicable, shall provide to Purchaser
any information relating to any Schedule Update reasonably requested by
Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, if (i) Purchaser would not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 4.3(e)_ as a result of
any change, event, effect or occurrence set forth in a Schedule Update or (ii)
a Schedule Update does not relate solely to changes, events, effects or
occurrences arising after the date of this Agreement, then such Schedule
Update shall not be deemed to have amended the schedules as of the date of
this Agreement, to have qualified the representations and warranties contained
in _ARTICLE V_ and _Article VI_ as of the date of this Agreement or to have
cured any misrepresentation or breach of warranty that may exist hereunder by
reason of the existence of such matter.

 



 

8.13 _Control of Business_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Purchaser acknowledges on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and
its and their directors, officers,

 



      
 

 



 

employees, Affiliates, agents, representatives, successors and assigns that
the operation of the Company and the Subsidiaries remains in the dominion and
control of the Company and the Subsidiaries until the Closing and that none of
the foregoing Persons will provide, directly or indirectly, any directions,
orders, advice, aid, assistance or information to any director, officer or
employee of the Company and the Subsidiaries, except as specifically
contemplated or permitted by _ARTICLE VIII_ or as otherwise consented to in
advance by an officer of the Company and the Subsidiaries.

 



 

8.14 _Hedge Contracts_. Prior to the Closing, Purchaser and Seller shall each
use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to negotiate, and deliver on the Closing,
master documentation consistent with the industry standard master
documentation that governs the Hedge Contracts, including master agreements
and master netting agreements, which master documentation shall reflect arms
length terms as modified by this _Section 8.14_ and under which Seller or a
member of Seller Group shall be one party and Company or a member of Company
Group shall be the other party (the " ** _Back-to-Back Documentation_** "). On
the Closing, the Company or a member of Company Group on the one hand and
Seller or a member of Seller Groups on the other hand shall enter into Back-
to-Back Trades governed by the applicable Back-to-Back Documentation, with
respect to each of the Hedge Contracts (including the Proprietary Hedge
Contracts). The Company shall procure that the Back-to-Back Documentation and
the Back-to-Back Trades are secured (and shall have the benefit of each
guarantee) on a _pari passu_ basis with the payment of principal (whether upon
liquidation or otherwise) on the senior-most class of debt incurred by the
Company or any member of the Company Group in connection with the Closing. The
Back-to-Back Documentation or the confirmations of the Back-to-Back Trades
executed thereunder (i) shall contain the price, period of time, delivery or
receipt points (if applicable) and other terms that correspond to the rights
and obligations of the Seller or member of the Seller Group under the
corresponding Hedge Contract so as to provide a seamless transfer of the risk
and title of the product in the Hedge Contract from the Seller or the
applicable member of the Seller Group to Company or the applicable member of
the Company Group, (ii) shall pass-through of all rights and obligations with
respect to payment, cover damages, replacement costs, indemnification,
liabilities, excuses (including force majeure claims) from the Seller or the
applicable member of the Seller Group to Company or the applicable member of
the Company Group, (iii) shall provide that the failure of the Back-to-Back
Trades to be secured and guaranteed as described in this _Section 8.14_ shall
constitute a default or termination event providing the non-defaulting or non-
affected party with industry standard remedies consistent with the remedies
under the corresponding Hedge Contract as modified by this _Section 8.14,_
and (iv) shall provide for payment by the Company or the applicable member of
the Company Group of the Monthly Intermediation Fee with respect to Hedge
Contracts that are not Proprietary Hedge Contracts. Notwithstanding any of the
foregoing, (a) with respect to the Hedge Contracts listed on _Schedule 8.14_,
Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably cooperate to novate or otherwise
transfer to the Company or the applicable member of the Company Group as of
Closing, at no cost, Seller or the member of Seller Groups position in such
Hedge Contract and, to the extent so novated or transferred, such Hedge
Contracts shall not be subject to Back-to-Back Trades and (b) where the Seller
determines it administratively convenient, in lieu of entering into a Back-to-
Back Trade with respect to any Hedge Contract, Seller may elect for Seller or
a member of Seller Group to

 



      
 

 



 

functionally convey the rights and obligations under such Hedge Contract to
Company or a member of Company Group by some other means, including but not
limited to the Company or a member of the Company Group accepting a novation
of the Hedge Contract, procuring a release of the Seller and all members of
the Seller Group under such Hedge Contract in connection with the Company or a
member of the Company Group entering into a replacement hedge contract on
substantially identical terms, entry into an asset management agreement with
the Company or a member of Company Group with respect to such position, or any
other commercially reasonable method (each, an **" _Alternative Hedge
Transfer_ "**) and the Company shall cooperate in good faith with the Seller
to execute any documentation reasonably required in connection with such
Alternative Hedge Transfer; _provided_ , that the Company shall not be
required to provide credit support in connection with such Alternative Hedge
Transfer, and notwithstanding such release, novation, transfer or conveyance,
such Alternative Hedge Transfer shall not relieve Seller of its obligation to
maintain, or to cause any applicable member of the Seller Group to maintain,
Seller Credit Support pursuant to _Section 8.15_ with respect to the Seller
Group Hedge Contract that is the subject of an Alternative Hedge Transfer.

 



 

8.15 _Credit Support_.

 



 

(a) For a period of 24 months after the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall
cause any applicable member of the Seller Group to, maintain in effect without
amendment all of letters of credit, guarantees and other contractual credit
support obligations entered into by or on behalf of Seller or any of its
Affiliates in connection with the Business (collectively, the " ** _Seller
Credit Support_** ") in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect as of
the Closing. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall use its Commercially
Reasonable Efforts (and shall reasonably cooperate with Sellers efforts) to
(i) terminate, or cause Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to be substituted
in all respects for Seller or any member of the Seller Group under, such
Seller Credit Support or (ii) to obtain from the creditor or other
counterparty a full release of Seller or any member of the Seller Group to the
extent liable, directly or indirectly, for reimbursement to the creditor or
fulfillment of other obligations to a counterparty in connection with amounts
drawn under such Seller Credit Support (such releases, collectively, the " **
_Credit Support Releases_** "), in the case of each of the foregoing clauses
(i) and (ii), to be effective as promptly as practicable after the Closing
Date. On the date that is 24 months after the Closing Date, Seller shall or
shall cause the applicable member of the Seller Group, to terminate any Seller
Credit Support for which Purchaser has not obtained any such substitution,
termination or Credit Support Release (each such Seller Credit Support, a " **
_Terminated Credit Support_** "). If Seller or a member of the Seller Group
incurs any liability or cost after the Closing in connection with the
Terminated Credit Support (including for breach of the obligation to maintain
the Seller Credit Support on and after the date that is 24 months after the
Closing Date), Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller
against, and reimburse Seller for, any and all Losses that Seller or a member
of the Seller Group becomes liable for in respect of such Terminated Credit
Support (including reasonable attorneys fees).

 



 

(b) In consideration of Sellers maintenance of the Seller Credit Support
pursuant to _Section 8.15(a)_, for so long as there is any such Seller Credit
Support outstanding,

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall pay to Seller (or to an Affiliate of
Seller designated in writing) the Credit Support Fee on the first Business Day
following the last day of each Credit Support Period. The Credit Support Fee
shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds into an account
designated by Seller in writing. If there ceases to be any Seller Credit
Support outstanding during any Credit Support Period, the Credit Support Fee
shall be prorated based on the number of days elapsed in such Credit Support
Period prior to and excluding the date that the Seller Credit Support ceased
to be outstanding and the Credit Support Fee will be due and payable on the
first Business Day following such date. The Credit Support Fee shall be the
sole compensation due to Seller in connection with Sellers maintenance of the
Seller Credit Support, but shall not affect Sellers or its Affiliates, as
applicable, rights under any Seller Credit Support or under this Agreement.

 



 

8.16 _Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to maintain or cause to
be maintained the Insurance Arrangements in full force and effect until the
Closing. From and after the Closing, the Company Group shall cease to be
insured by, have access or availability to, or be entitled to make claims on,
claim benefits from or seek coverage under any Seller Insurance Policies,
except: (i) with respect to any claim asserted against, or loss incurred by,
any member of the Company Group after the Closing (" ** _Post-Closing
Claims_** ") arising out of an act, claim, omission, event, circumstance,
occurrence or loss occurring prior to the Closing, the Company Group may
access coverage under the occurrence-based Seller Insurance Policies issued or
in place prior to the Closing under which any member of the Company Group is
insured (" ** _Pre-Closing Occurrence Based Policies_** ") to the extent such
insurance coverage exists; (ii) after the Closing, any member of the Company
Group may seek coverage for any Post-Closing Claim under any applicable Pre-
Closing Occurrence Based Policy to the extent such insurance coverage exists
and Seller and its Affiliates shall cooperate with the Company and Purchaser
in connection with tendering or pursuing such claims; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (A) Purchaser or the Company shall promptly notify Seller of all such
Post-Closing Claims and (B) without limiting any indemnity obligation of the
Seller under _Section 10.2_, Purchaser and the Company shall be responsible
for the satisfaction or payment of any applicable retention, deductible or
retrospective premium with respect to any Post-Closing Claim and shall
reimburse Seller and its Affiliates for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred in connection with such claims; and (iii) in the event that
a Post-Closing Claim relates to the same occurrence for which Seller, its
Affiliates or assignees are seeking coverage under Pre-Closing Occurrence
Based Policies, and the limits under an applicable Pre-Closing Occurrence
Based Policy are not sufficient to fund all covered claims of the Company or
any member of the Company Group, as applicable, and Seller or its Affiliates
and assignees, as applicable, amounts due under such a Pre-Closing Occurrence
Based Policy shall be paid to the respective entities in proportion to the
amounts which otherwise would be due were the limits of liability infinite.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the provisions set forth in _Section 10.6(a)_, with
respect to each claim, act, omission, event, circumstance, occurrence or loss
set forth on _Schedule 8.16(b)_ (the " ** _Excluded Claims_** ") that either
(i) in the case of claims-made Company Insurance Policies,

 



      
 

 



 

was reported to the applicable insurer on or prior to the Closing Date, or
(ii) is or may be covered by any occurrence-based Company Insurance Policy,
from and after the Closing, the Company shall (and shall cause the
Subsidiaries to) file, and use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to pursue and
collect, claims under the applicable Company Insurance Policies in respect of
any such Excluded Claim. The Company shall (and shall cause the Subsidiaries
to) promptly remit to the Seller any proceeds (less any reasonable costs or
expenses incurred to pursue such claims) received under the Company Insurance
Policies after the Closing in respect of any of the foregoing claims. Whenever
this _Section 8.16(b)_ requires any member of the Company Group to take any
action after the Closing, such requirement shall be deemed to constitute an
undertaking on the part of Purchaser to take such action or to cause such
member of the Company Group to take such action.

 



 

(c) With respect to any claim asserted against, or loss incurred by, any
member of the Company Group after the date of this Agreement for any act,
omission, event, circumstance, occurrence or loss (other than an Excluded
Claim) (" ** _Post-Signing Claim_** ") that is covered under a Company
Insurance Policy, Seller shall (and shall cause the Company and the
Subsidiaries to) file, and use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to pursue and
collect, claims under the applicable Company Insurance Policies in respect of
any such Post-Signing Claim. Seller shall cause the Company and the
Subsidiaries to hold any proceeds (less any reasonable costs or expenses
incurred to pursue such claims) received prior to the Closing, except for (i)
proceeds that reimburse the Company or any Subsidiary for out-of-pocket costs
incurred to fix or mitigate a Post-Signing Claim prior to Closing and (ii)
proceeds in respect of losses arising from business interruption covered under
the applicable Company Insurance Policies ( _provided_ that such proceeds
under this clause (ii) shall constitute Excluded Claims), under the Company
Insurance Policies in respect of any of the foregoing claims (" ** _Post-
Signing Insurance Proceeds_** ") for the benefit and account of the Company
Group. Any proceeds received after the Closing under the Company Insurance
Policies in respect of any of the foregoing claims shall be for the benefit
and account of the Company Group; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser
shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to promptly remit to Seller any
such proceeds that (A) reimburse the Company or any member of the Company
Group for any out-of-pocket costs incurred prior to the Closing to fix or
mitigate a Post-Signing Event or (B) are in respect of losses arising from
business interruption covered under the applicable Company Insurance Policies
prior to the Closing.

 



 

8.17 _Mutual Release_. Effective as of the Closing, the Seller Group, on the
one hand, and Purchaser and the Company Group, on the other hand, hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably and forever release and discharge the other
and its past, present and future directors, officers, equityholders and
employees, and all of the foregoing persons successors, assigns and agents
(each, a " ** _Released Party_** "), of and from, and hereby unconditionally
and irrevocably waive, any and all claims, debts, losses, expenses,
proceedings, covenants, liabilities, suits, judgments, damages, actions and
causes of action, obligations, accounts, and liabilities of any kind or
character whatsoever, known or unknown, contingent or unconditional, matured
or unmatured, fixed or variable, suspected or unsuspected, in contract or
tort, at Law or in equity, direct or indirect, that such party ever had, now
has or ever may have or claim to have against

 



      
 

 



 

any Released Party, for or by reason of any matter, circumstance, event,
action, inaction, omission, cause or thing whatsoever arising prior to the
Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that this release shall not affect (i) any
claims relating to any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or the
Related Documents or any of the provisions set forth herein or therein or any
claims for indemnification pursuant to _ARTICLE X_, (ii) any right to receive
salary, bonuses and expenses that have accrued in respect of employment with
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries in the Ordinary Course of Business or
any agreement with the Company or any of the Subsidiaries relating to
employment or pursuant to which the Company or any Subsidiary is or may be
obligated to make any retention, severance, termination or similar payment or
(iii) any right to indemnification, exculpation or advancement of expenses,
whether under corporate indemnification, director and officer insurance or
otherwise, to which any individual may be entitled as a result of such
individuals service as a director, officer, or employee of the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries.

 



 

8.18 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax Returns_. Seller shall control the preparation
and filing of all Tax Returns for the Company and the Subsidiaries with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period required to be filed after the Closing
Date, provided that, prior to such filing, Purchaser shall have the right to
review, comment on and approve any such Tax Returns (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). To the extent that any Tax Return prepared
by Seller pursuant to this _Section 8.18(a)_ shows a net operating loss of
the Company or any Subsidiary arising from any Pre-Closing Tax Period, such
net operating loss shall be carried back to previous Tax periods to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Law. Upon Sellers request, Purchaser
shall execute any powers of attorney or similar documents that may be required
to effectuate the intent of this _Section 8.18(a)_.

 



 

(b) _Straddle Period Tax Returns_. Purchaser shall control the preparation and
filing of all Tax Returns for the Company and the Subsidiaries with respect to
any Straddle Period, provided that, prior to such filing, Seller shall have
the right to review, comment on and approve any such Tax Returns (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Any Tax Return prepared
by Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 8.18(b)_ shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice of the Company unless otherwise required by
applicable Law; _provided_ that to the extent that such Tax Return shows a net
operating loss of the Company or any Subsidiary arising from the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, such net operating loss shall
be carried back to previous Tax periods to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. Purchaser or the Seller, as required by applicable Law,
shall file all Tax Returns required to be filed to report any transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration or such other similar Taxes and
fees (including any penalties and interest) (" ** _Transfer Taxes_** ")
imposed on or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
other than any Transfer Taxes with respect to the Reorganization which shall
be the sole responsibility of the Seller. Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Seller, on the other hand, shall each bear fifty percent of all such Transfer
Taxes.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Allocation of Tax Liabilities_. To the extent permitted or required by
Law or administrative practice, the taxable year of the Company and each of
the Subsidiaries which includes the Closing Date shall be treated as closing
on (and including) the Closing Date. Where it is necessary for purposes of
this Agreement to apportion between Seller and Purchaser the Taxes of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period (which is not treated
under the immediately preceding sentence as closing on the Closing Date), such
liability shall be apportioned between the period deemed to end at the close
of the Closing Date, and the period deemed to begin at the beginning of the
day following the Closing Date on the basis of an interim closing of the
books, except that property Taxes and ad valorem Taxes shall be allocated on a
daily basis.

 



 

(e) _Amended Returns_. Except upon Sellers written request pursuant to
_Section 8.18(f)_, neither Purchaser nor any Affiliate of Purchaser shall (or
shall cause or permit the Company or any Subsidiary to) amend, refile or
otherwise modify (or grant an extension of any statute of limitation with
respect to) any Tax Return with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any
Straddle Period without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may
be withheld in the sole discretion of Seller. Seller shall have the exclusive
right to (i) prepare (or cause to be prepared) any amended Tax Returns of the
Company or any Subsidiary to the extent that any such Tax Return relates to
any Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period. Upon Sellers request, Purchaser
shall file (or caused to be filed) any amended Tax Return described in the
immediately preceding sentence and shall execute any powers of attorney or
similar documents that may be required to effectuate the intent of this
_Section 8.18(e)_.

 



 

(f) _Refunds_. Purchaser shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Seller any Tax
refunds (including any interest paid thereon and net of any Taxes incurred in
respect of the receipt or accrual of the refund) that are received by the
Company or any Subsidiary (or Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser on their
behalf), and any amounts credited against Tax to which the Company or any
Subsidiary (or Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser on their behalf)
becomes entitled, that relate to Pre-Closing Tax Periods or the portion of any
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date. Upon Sellers request, Purchaser
shall file (or cause to be filed) all Tax Returns (including amended Tax
Returns) or other documents claiming any refunds, including through the
carryback of any net operating losses that are attributable to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period or the portion of any Straddle period ending on the Closing Date,
to which Seller is entitled pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

(g) _Post-Closing Actions_. Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Affiliates (including, after the Closing for the avoidance of doubt, the
Company or any Subsidiary) to (i) voluntarily approach any Taxing Authority
regarding any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or any Subsidiary relating
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of any Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date, (ii) take any action relating to Taxes, or that could create
a Tax Liability, on the Closing Date after the Closing that is outside the
ordinary course of business (other than as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement) or (iii) except upon Sellers request pursuant to _Section
8.18(f)_, carry back any net operating losses arising from any Tax

 



      
 

 



 

period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date.

 



 

(h) _Tax Cooperation_. Without limiting the obligations set forth in _Section
8.1_, Purchaser and Seller shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each
other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance relating to the Business (including access to books and records) as
is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any
election related to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Taxing
Authority, and the prosecution or defense of any audit, proposed adjustment or
deficiency, assessment, claim, suit or other proceeding relating to any Taxes
or Tax Returns. Purchaser agrees that it shall preserve and keep, or cause to
be preserved and kept, all original books and records in respect of the
Business relating to any Taxes with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods and the
portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and in the
possession of Purchaser or its Affiliates in accordance with _Section 8.1_.

 



 

8.19 _Continuing Employee Information_. Purchaser agrees that, immediately
following the Closing, Purchaser shall instruct each Continuing Employee and
use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause each Continuing Employee to
agree, (a) to at all times maintain the confidentiality of all confidential or
proprietary information in such Continuing Employees possession or control
that relates to any business of the Seller Group, including any such
confidential or proprietary information obtained inadvertently by such
Continuing Employee or contained or stored in such Continuing Employees
personal electronic devices (including mobile phones, smartphones, tablets,
laptop computers and desktop computers) (" ** _Personal Electronic Devices_**
"), (b) to delete from all of such Continuing Employees Personal Electronic
Devices all confidential or proprietary information that relates to any
business of the Seller Group and (c) not to use, or disclose or make available
to any third party, any confidential or proprietary information that relates
to any business of the Seller Group, including historical data relating solely
to the business of the Seller Group contained in ISO accounts that are
retained by the Company Group from and after Closing, for any purpose at any
time during or after such Continuing Employees employment by the Company or
any of its Affiliates. Purchaser agrees that it shall, as promptly as
practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days after the Closing Date, deliver to Seller a written
certification executed by each Continuing Employee acknowledging that (i)
Purchaser has notified such Continuing Employee of each of the foregoing
obligations in (a), (b) and (c) and (ii) such Continuing Employee is in
compliance with, and agrees to continue to comply with, the foregoing
obligations in (a), (b) and (c) from and after the term of such Continuing
Employees employment by the Company or any of its Affiliates. Purchaser
further acknowledges and agrees that the Company Group will be solely and
fully responsible and liable for any breach (y) of its obligations with
respect to any confidential or proprietary information that relates to any
business of the Seller Group or (z) by any Continuing Employee of any of the
foregoing obligations in (a), (b) or (c), that occurs from and after the
Closing. The provisions of this _Section 8.19_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, Retainco and shall not be modified or
terminated in any manner as to adversely affect Retainco, without the prior
written consent of Retainco.

 



      
 

 



 

8.20 _Termination of Affiliate Contracts and Obligations_. Except for any
Affiliate Contract or other liability or obligation set forth on _Schedule
8.20_ , any Proprietary Hedge Contract and any Back-to-Back Documentation,
prior to the Closing, Seller and the Company shall take all actions necessary
to cause (a) each Affiliate Contract to be terminated and the Company Group to
have no further liabilities or obligations thereunder and (b) all liabilities
and obligations of the Company Group to the Seller Group (except for any such
liabilities and obligations created by this Agreement or the Related
Documents) to be terminated and discharged, in each case, to be effective as
of the Closing.

 



 

8.21 _No Solicitation; Alternative Transactions_. Prior to the Closing, none
of Seller, the Company nor any Subsidiary shall, and Seller shall cause its
Affiliates and representatives not to, directly or indirectly, encourage,
solicit, participate in or initiate discussions or negotiations with, or
provide any information to, any Person or group (other than any party hereto
or any Affiliate, associate or designee of any party hereto) concerning any
proposal for the sale, merger, combination, joint venture or other transaction
involving all or any part of the businesses and properties of the Company and
the Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto agree that
this _Section 8.21_ shall not restrict the FirstLight Transfer.

 



 

8.22 _Merger of the Company into DebtCo_. Each of Purchaser, Seller and the
Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, take all
action necessary (including under applicable Law) to cause DebtCo to merge
with and into the Company (the " ** _DebtCo Merger_** ") substantially
simultaneously with the Closing, whereupon the separate existence of DebtCo
shall cease, and the Company shall continue its existence under the Laws of
the State of Delaware as the surviving company in the Merger. On the
effectiveness of the Merger, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of either DebtCo or the Company, all of the issued and outstanding
equity interests of DebtCo will be cancelled without exchange or conversion
into, or receipt of, any equity interests of the Company or any other person,
or any other consideration.

 



 

8.23 _Transition Services_. From and after the date of this Agreement, the
parties hereto shall cooperate in good faith and shall use their Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to (i) initiate integration and transition planning efforts
and (ii) complete the negotiation of a customary transition services agreement
to be entered into and effective as of the Closing pursuant to which Retainco
or one of its Affiliates will provide certain limited transition services to
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates for a defined period of time following the
Closing and for the compensation set forth therein.

 



 

8.24 _Additional Cooperation_ _._

 



 

(a) Until the earlier of the Closing and such time as this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall use its
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cooperate (or cause its Subsidiaries to
cooperate) in connection with (i) any offerings that are registered under
Dynegy Inc.s existing or future shelf registration statements on Form S-3 and
(ii) in order for Dynegy Inc. to comply with its reporting obligations under
the Exchange Act and its obligation to maintain the availability of its
existing and future shelf registration

 



       
 

 



 

statements on Form S-3 (each, a "Dynegy Financing Transaction "), at
Purchasers sole cost and expense, limited to the following (i) furnishing the
Dynegy Required Financial Information (provided that such Dynegy Required
Financial Information shall not include "segment reporting," information
required by Regulation S-X Rule 3-09, Regulation S-X Rule 3-10 and Regulation
S-X Rule 3-16, or projections or pro forma financial statements), (ii)
furnishing the information required by Item 303 Managements Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Regulation S-K
and (iii) causing the independent accountants of the Company to provide
assistance and cooperation, including providing customary consents in
connection with any Dynegy Financing Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, Purchaser shall, promptly upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred
by the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates in
connection with such cooperation. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, this _Section 8.24_ shall not be included for purposes of

representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement
(other than the Company/Seller Fundamental Warranties and the representations

employees, stockholders, agents, attorneys, representatives, successors and
permitted assigns (collectively, the " ** _Purchaser_**

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _Indemnified Parties_** ") harmless from and against, and pay to the
applicable Purchaser Indemnified Parties the amount of, any and all Losses

(i) the failure of any of the representations or warranties made by Seller or

Agreement and as of the Closing Date (as though made on the Closing Date),
unless such representations or warranties relate to an earlier date and are
true and correct as of such earlier date;

 



 

(ii) the failure by (A) the Company or the Seller to comply with any covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement to be performed by such party prior

(a) Subject to _Section 10.5_, Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify and hold

assigns (collectively, the " ** _Seller Indemnified Parties_** ") harmless
from and against, and pay to the applicable Seller Indemnified Parties the
amount of, any and all Losses based upon or resulting from:

 



 

(i) the failure of any of the representations or warranties made by Purchaser

as of the Closing Date (as though made on the Closing Date), unless such
representations or warranties relate to an earlier date and are true and
correct as of such earlier date;

 



 

(ii) the failure by Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary to comply with
any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement to be performed by such
Person following the Closing; and

 



 

(iii) any Assumed Liability.

 



 

(b) Seller shall take and cause its Affiliates to take all Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event which

10.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party
claim shall be asserted by a Notice of Claim to the party from whom
indemnification is sought setting forth the specific claim and the basis
therefor in reasonable detail.

 



 

(b) In the event that any Legal Proceedings shall be instituted, or that any
claim shall be asserted, by any third party in respect of which payment may be
sought under _Sections 10.2_ or _10.3_ (regardless of the limitations set
forth in _Section 10.5_) (an " ** _Indemnification Claim_** "), the
indemnified party shall promptly cause a Notice of Claim of the assertion of
any Indemnification Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by this
indemnity to be forwarded to the indemnifying party. The failure of the
indemnified party to give reasonably prompt notice of any Indemnification
Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the indemnifying partys
obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that the indemnifying
party is prejudiced as a result of such failure. The indemnifying party shall
have the right, at its sole option and expense, to be represented by counsel
of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party,
and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against by it
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the indemnifying party shall not be
entitled to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
Indemnification Claim that arises in connection with a criminal proceeding;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the indemnifying party shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of any such Indemnification Claim that arises in
connection with a criminal proceeding, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the indemnified party, at the indemnifying partys sole cost and expense. If
the indemnifying party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified against by it hereunder, it shall within 30 days (or sooner, if
the nature of the Indemnification Claim so requires) notify the indemnified
party in writing of its intent to do so. During such 30-day period, the
indemnified party, in consultation with the indemnifying party, may make such
filings, including motions for continuance (and answers if a motion for
continuance has not been granted), as may be necessary to preserve the
parties positions and rights with respect to such Indemnification Claim), and
the reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in connection therewith shall be
considered Losses indemnifiable under this Agreement. If the indemnifying
party elects not to, or is not permitted to, defend against, negotiate, settle
or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified against hereunder, the indemnified party may defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Indemnification Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the indemnified party shall not settle,
compromise, permit a default or consent to the entry of judgment with respect
to any such Indemnification Claim without the prior written consent of the
indemnifying party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). If the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of
any Indemnification Claim, the indemnified party may participate, at its own
expense, in the defense of such Indemnification Claim; _provided_ , _however_
, that such indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in any such
defense with separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party if, (i)
so requested by the indemnifying party to participate or (ii) in the
reasonable opinion of counsel to the indemnified party, a conflict or

 



      
 

 



 

potential conflict exists between the indemnified party and the indemnifying
party that would make such separate representation advisable; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the indemnifying party shall not be required to pay for more
than one such counsel (plus any appropriate local counsel) for all indemnified
parties in connection with any Indemnification Claim. The parties hereto agree
to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation
or settlement of any such Indemnification Claim. Notwithstanding anything in
this _Section 10.4_ to the contrary, the indemnifying party shall not,
without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), whether or not
the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such Indemnification
Claim, settle or compromise any Indemnification Claim or permit a default or
consent to entry of any judgment with respect thereto unless (A) such
settlement, compromise, default or judgment (1) includes a full and
unconditional waiver and release by the claimant of all applicable indemnified
parties without any cost or liability of any nature whatsoever to such
indemnified parties, (2) does not involve any finding or admission of any
violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by any applicable indemnified
party and (3) does not result in any Lien on any of the assets of, or contain
any restriction or condition that would adversely affect the future conduct
of, any applicable indemnified party and (B) the indemnifying party pays or
causes to be paid all amounts of such settlement, compromise, default or
judgement.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a settlement offer solely for money
damages is made by the applicable third party claimant, and the indemnifying
party notifies the indemnified party in writing of the indemnifying partys
willingness to accept the settlement offer and, subject to the applicable
limitations of _Sections 10.5_ and _10.6_ , pay the amount called for by such
offer, and the indemnified party declines to accept such offer, the
indemnified party may continue to contest such Indemnification Claim, free of
any participation by the indemnifying party, and the amount of any ultimate
liability with respect to such Indemnification Claim that the indemnifying
party has an obligation to pay hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of (i)
the amount of the settlement offer that the indemnified party declined to
accept or (ii) the aggregate Losses of the indemnified party with respect to
such Indemnification Claim.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section
10.4(b)-(c)_, with respect to an Indemnification Claim involving the Excluded
Legal Proceedings pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(iii)_, the following
procedures shall control and govern:

 



 

(i) Seller shall be represented by Bracewell LLP or other counsel of Sellers
choice and Seller shall have the right to cause the Company and any other
applicable members of the Company Group involved in the Excluded Legal
Proceedings to be represented by the same counsel or other counsel of Sellers
choice (and Purchaser and the Company Group shall not otherwise be represented
by counsel without obtaining the prior written consent of Seller). Seller
shall have the exclusive right to defend against, negotiate, settle,
compromise, discharge or otherwise deal with the Excluded Legal Proceedings in
its sole discretion, except that, without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, Seller shall not agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge
that (A) would reasonably be expected to result in any Lien on any of the
assets of, or any

 



      
 

 



 

restriction that would adversely affect, except in any immaterial respect, the
future conduct of, the Company Group or the Business. Purchaser may
participate in the defense of the Excluded Legal Proceedings only to the
extent and in the manner requested by Seller in its sole discretion or (B)
would require any member of the Company Group to pay any amount with respect
thereto.

 



 

(ii) Subject to _Section 10.4(d)(i)_, the parties hereto agree to cooperate
fully with each other in connection with defending against, negotiating,
settling, compromising, discharging or otherwise dealing with the Excluded
Legal Proceedings. Furthermore, Purchaser agrees to take all actions, and
cause applicable members of the Company Group to take all actions, reasonably
required by Seller in connection with defending against, negotiating,
settling, compromising, discharging or otherwise dealing with the Excluded
Legal Proceedings, including (A) executing and delivering settlement
agreements or other documents to third parties (including a Governmental
Body), (B) filing court papers as a named litigant or interested party in the
Excluded Legal Proceedings and (C) communicating with third parties (including
a Governmental Body) in consultation with Seller.

 



 

(e) After (i) any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered
by a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the
time in which to appeal therefrom, (ii) a settlement shall have been
consummated or (iii) the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall
have arrived at a mutually binding agreement, in each case, with respect to a
claim for indemnification hereunder, the indemnified party shall forward to
the indemnifying party notice of any sums due and owing by the indemnifying
party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter and the
indemnifying party shall pay all of such remaining sums so due and owing to
the indemnified party by wire transfer of immediately available funds within
five (5) Business Days after the date of such notice. If the indemnifying
party makes any payment on any claim for indemnification hereunder, the
indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all
rights and remedies of the indemnified party to any insurance benefits or
other claims of the indemnified party with respect to such claim for
indemnification hereunder.

 



 

10.5 _Certain Indemnification Matters; Certain Limitations on
Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of this _ARTICLE X_:

 



 

(i) Seller shall not have any indemnification obligations for Losses under
_Section 10.2(a)(i)_ (other than Sellers indemnification obligations arising
out of any failure of any Company/Seller Fundamental Warranty or Tax Warranty
to be true and correct) (A) for any individual item, or group of items arising
out of the same event, where the Loss relating thereto is less than $300,000
(the " ** _De Minimis Threshold_** ") and (B) in respect of each individual
item, or group of items arising out of the same event, where the Loss relating
thereto is equal to or greater than the De Minimis Threshold, unless the
aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds $50,000,000 (the " **
_Deductible_** "), and then only to the extent of such excess;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) in no event shall the aggregate indemnification obligations of Seller
under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ (other than Sellers indemnification obligations
arising out of any failure of any Company/Seller Fundamental Warranty or Tax
Warranty to be true and correct, which obligations shall not be taken into
account in determining whether the Cap has been exceeded) exceed $200,000,000
(the " ** _Cap_** ");

 



 

(iii) in no event shall the aggregate liability of Seller for (A) its
indemnification obligations under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ for the failure of any

parties set forth in this Agreement and (D) its indemnification obligations
under _Section 10.2(a)(iii)_ exceed the Base Purchase Price;

 



 

(iv) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be deemed not to
have suffered or incurred any Losses under _Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.3_
arising from any item or matter that was included in the determination of
Final Net Working Capital in accordance with _Section 3.3(a)_, as it is the
intent of the parties hereto that the procedures set forth in _Section 3.3_
shall provide the sole and exclusive remedies for such claims and that the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not have recourse pursuant to _Section
10.2_ for breaches of representations, warranties or covenants contained in
this Agreement for matters resolved pursuant to _Section 3.3_;

 



 

(v) no indemnifying party shall be liable for any Loss which is contingent,
unless and until such contingent Loss becomes an actual Loss of the
indemnified party which is due and payable;

 



 

(vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall be deemed to not have suffered or incurred any
Losses under this Agreement arising out of (and accordingly, for the avoidance
of doubt, shall not have any claim for indemnification under any provision of
this Agreement based on) the utilization, reduction, or limitation on the use,
of any Tax attributes of the Company or any Subsidiary that arose in a taxable
period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date (for the
avoidance of doubt, including any utilization or reduction of such Tax
attributes as a result of the Reorganization or the FirstLight Transfer),
except solely to the extent such utilization, reduction or limitation results
in a cash Tax liability of the Company or any Subsidiary that is attributable
to a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing
Date;

 



 

(vii) Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified
Party to the extent of any Losses in respect of any Taxes of the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries resulting from or attributable to any Tax period
ending after the Closing Date or to any Straddle Period, to the extent (as
determined pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 8.18(d)_) attributable
to the portion of such Straddle Period beginning on and ending after the
Closing Date; and

 



      
 

 



 

(viii) the obligation of any indemnifying party to indemnify for any Losses
pursuant to _Section 10.2_ or _10.3_ shall be effective and such indemnitors
shall be liable only if a written notice of claim (a " ** _Notice of Claim_**
") is delivered pursuant to _Section 10.4_ with respect to such Loss within
the applicable Survival Period specified in _Section 10.1_.

 



 

(b) Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party
and Purchaser shall not be required to indemnify any Seller Indemnified Party
to the extent of any Losses that a court of competent jurisdiction shall have
determined by final judgment to have resulted from any bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct occurring after the Closing of the party
seeking indemnification.

 



 

(c) All materiality qualifications (including the terms "material," "Material
Adverse Effect" and "material adverse effect") contained in the
representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement
(other than the representations and warranties contained in the last sentence
of _Section 5.6(a)_ and _Section 5.7(b)_) shall be disregarded for all
purposes of this _ARTICLE X_, including for (i) determining whether there is
a failure of any of the representations or warranties of the parties contained
in this Agreement to be true and correct as of the applicable date set forth
in _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 10.3(a)(i)_ and _(ii)_ determining the
amount of Losses based upon or arising from any such failure.

 



 

10.6 _Calculation of Losses_.

 



 

(a) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
_ARTICLE X_ shall be calculated net of, and reduced by (i) any amounts
actually recovered by the indemnified party pursuant to any Contract to which
it is a party or any applicable insurance coverage (including any applicable
corporate indemnification or director and officer insurance) covering such
Losses and (ii) any cash Tax benefit actually realized by the indemnified
party in connection with any of the events or circumstances giving rise or
otherwise related to such Losses in the year the applicable indemnification
payment is made. Purchaser shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
recover under any such Contract or insurance coverage prior to seeking
indemnification under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) With respect to any claim for indemnification for any matter not involving
an Indemnification Claim, in valuing a Loss, no adjustment shall be made as a
result of any multiple, increase factor, or any premium over fair market,
book, or historical value that may have been paid by Purchaser for the Shares,
whether or not such multiple, increase factor or other premium had been used
by Purchaser at the time of, or in connection with, calculating its bid for
the Shares, its proposed purchase price for the Shares or the final purchase
price for the Shares.

 



 

(c) Any Loss subject to indemnification under this Agreement shall be
determined without duplication of recovery due to the facts giving rise to
such Loss constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

10.7 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Seller and Purchaser agree to
treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_ as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

except for claims of intentional fraud with respect to the representations and
warranties of the parties set forth in this Agreement, following the Closing,

indirectly) under, out of, or related to this Agreement (including (i) the
transactions contemplated hereby and any representations and warranties set
forth herein, made in connection herewith or made as an inducement to enter
into this Agreement and (ii) any certificates to be delivered hereunder), or
the sale and purchase of the Shares, shall be the rights of indemnification
set forth in _ARTICLE X_ only, and (b) no Person will have any other
entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether in Contract, tort or otherwise, or
whether at Law or in equity, and regardless of the legal theory under which
such entitlement, remedy or recourse may be sought or imposed (including all
rights afforded by any statute which limits the effects of a release with
respect to unknown claims), it being agreed that all of such other remedies,
entitlements and recourse are expressly waived and released by the parties
hereto to the fullest extent permitted by Law. The provisions of this _Section

remedies provided in _Section 3.3_ and this _ARTICLE X_, in agreeing to the

Seller and Purchaser shall bear its own costs and expenses (including any
legal, accounting and other professional fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other
agreement, document and instrument contemplated by this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



 

11.2 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, the Related Documents and all Related
Claims shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rules (whether of the
State of Delaware or otherwise) that would cause the application of Laws of
any other jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto agrees that except as
specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, all claims or causes of
action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against
any Financing Source in any way relating to any Debt Financing or the
performance thereof, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York.

 



      
 

 



 

11.3 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process_.

 



 

(a) Except as provided in _Section 3.3_, the parties hereto hereby (i)
irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal
court within the State of Delaware) over all claims or causes of action
(whether in Contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement or the Related Documents or the Related Claims, and (ii)
irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York (or any appellate
court therefrom), for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding
against any Financing Source arising out of the Debt Financing or the
performance thereof, and, in each case, each party hereby irrevocably agrees
that all claims in respect of such dispute, claim or cause of action or any
Legal Proceeding related thereto may be heard and determined in such courts.
The parties hereto hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such dispute, claim or cause of action brought in such
court or any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such
dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a judgment in any such dispute
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to process being served by any
party to this Agreement in any Legal Proceeding by the delivery of a copy
thereof in accordance with the provisions of _Section 11.7_.

 



 

11.4 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. **EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST IT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY RELATED CLAIMS AND ANY OF
THE AGREEMENTS CONTEMPLATED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING ANY DEBT FINANCING).**

 



 

11.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the schedules and exhibits
to this Agreement) and the Related Documents contain the entire agreement and
understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements and
understandings (including any offer letters or term sheets), whether written
or oral, relating to such subject matter. The parties hereto have voluntarily
agreed to define their rights, liabilities and obligations respecting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement exclusively in Contract pursuant
to the express terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the parties hereto
expressly disclaim that they are owed any duties or entitled to any remedies
not expressly set forth in or contemplated by this Agreement. Furthermore, the
parties each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies the justifiable
expectations of

 



      
 

 



 

sophisticated parties derived from arms-length negotiations, and all parties
to this Agreement specifically acknowledge that no party has any special
relationship with another party that would justify any expectation beyond that
of an ordinary purchaser and an ordinary seller in an arms-length
transaction.

 



 

11.6 _Amendments and Waivers_. Subject to _Section 8.12_ and _Section 8.19_,
this Agreement and the Related Documents can be amended, supplemented or
changed, and any provision hereof or thereof can be waived, only by written
instrument making specific reference to this Agreement (and, if applicable,
the Related Documents) signed by the party against whom enforcement of any
such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is sought; _provided_ that
this _Section 11.6_ and _Sections 11.2_ , _11.3_ , _11.4_ , _11.9_ , _11.10_
and _11.14_ (and the related definitions and other provisions of this
Agreement to the extent a modification would serve to modify the substance of
such provisions in a manner adverse to a Financing Source) may not be amended
or modified in a manger that is adverse to any Financing Source without the
prior written consent of such Financing Source. No action taken pursuant to
this Agreement or the Related Documents, including any investigation by or on
behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party
(including any Financing Source) taking such action of compliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver
by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as
a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any
party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

 



 

11.7 _Notices_. All notices and other communications under this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (a) when delivered personally by
hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (b) when sent by facsimile (with
written confirmation of transmission), (c) one (1) Business Day following the
day sent by overnight courier (with written confirmation of receipt), or (d)

11.8 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement or the
Related Documents is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any
Law or public policy, all other terms or provisions of this Agreement or the
Related Documents shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long
as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Any such term or
provision held invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced only in part
or degree will remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid,
illegal, or incapable of being enforced. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement or the
Related Documents so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest
extent possible.

 



 

11.9 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding solely upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to
create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person or entity not a party
to this Agreement except as expressly set forth in this Agreement (including
_Sections 8.7_ , _8.19_ and _ARTICLE X_); _provided_ that the Financing
Sources shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 11.9_ and
_Sections 11.2_ , _11.3_ , _11.4_ , _11.6_ , _11.10_ and _11.14_ ). No
assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be
made by any party hereto, directly or indirectly (by operation of Law or
otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and
any attempted assignment without the required consents shall be void;
_provided_ that, without the need for consent, Purchaser may (a) make a
collateral assignment of its rights (but not obligations) under this Agreement
to any Financing Source providing Debt Financing to Purchaser and (b) may
assign all of its rights (but not its obligations) under this Agreement to
purchase and acquire the Shares to a wholly owned Subsidiary of Purchaser. No
assignment of any obligations hereunder shall relieve the parties hereto of
any such obligations. Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in
this Agreement to Purchaser shall also apply to any such assignee unless the
context otherwise requires.

 



 

11.10 _Non-Recourse_. All claims or causes of action (whether in Contract or
in tort, in Law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may be based upon,
in respect of, arise under, out of or by reason of, be connected with, or
related in any manner to this Agreement, the Related Documents or the Related
Claims may be made only against (and are expressly limited to) the Persons
that are expressly identified as parties hereto or thereto (the " **
_Contracting Parties_** "). No Person who is not a Contracting Party,
including any director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of, and any
financial advisor or lender to, any of the foregoing (" ** _Non-Party
Affiliates_** "), shall have any liability (whether in Contract or in tort, in
Law or in equity, or granted by statute or based upon

 



      
 

 



 

any theory that seeks to impose liability of an entity party against its
owners or Affiliates) for any claims, causes of action, obligations or
liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with or related in any manner
to this Agreement or the Related Documents or based on, in respect of, or by
reason of this Agreement or the Related Documents or their negotiation,
execution performance or breach; and, to the maximum extent permitted by Law,
each Contracting Party waives and releases all such liabilities, claims and
obligations against any such Non-Party Affiliates. Without limiting the
foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, (a) each Contracting Party
hereby waives and releases any and all rights, claims, demands, or causes of
action that may otherwise be available at Law or in equity, or granted by
statute, to avoid or disregard the entity form of a Contracting Party or
otherwise impose liability of a Contracting Party on any Non-Party Affiliate,
whether granted by statute or based on theories of equity, agency, control,
instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise,
piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise; and (b) each
Contracting Party disclaims any reliance upon any Non-Party Affiliates with
respect to the performance of this Agreement or the Related Documents or any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to
this Agreement or the Related Documents. The parties acknowledge and agree
that the Non-Party Affiliates are intended third-party beneficiaries of this
_Section 11.10_.

 



 

11.11 _Specific Performance_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the
breach of this Agreement would cause irreparable damage to the other party
hereto and that neither party will have an adequate remedy at law. Therefore,
prior to termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 4.3_, the
obligations of Seller under this Agreement, including Sellers obligation to
sell the Shares to Purchaser, and the obligations of Purchaser under this
Agreement, including Purchasers obligation to purchase and acquire the Shares
from Seller, shall be enforceable by a decree of specific performance issued
by any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief may
be applied for and granted in connection therewith. Such remedies shall,
however, be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other
remedies which any party may have under this Agreement or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that Seller and the
Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of Purchasers
obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund its obligations
under _Section 3.2(c)_ and _Section 4.2(b)(i)_ and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement only in the event the Debt
Financing has been funded in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letter or a commitment from the Financing Sources that the Debt Financing will
be funded in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter at the
Closing if the Equity Financing is funded.

 



 

11.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and the Related Documents may be executed
in two or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original
copy of this Agreement or, as applicable, the Related Document, and all of
which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this
Agreement or the Related Documents electronically (including portable document
format (.pdf)) or by facsimile shall be as effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

11.13 _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_.

 



 

(a) Each party to this Agreement agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of
its Affiliates and representatives, that Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP may serve
as counsel to members of the Seller Group, on the one hand, and members of the
Company Group, on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Related
Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, and that, following the Closing, Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP (or any
successor thereof) may serve as counsel to any member of the Seller Group or
any Affiliate or representative thereof in connection with any Legal
Proceeding, litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to such
transactions or this Agreement or the Related Documents notwithstanding such
prior representation of any member of the Company Group, and each party to
this Agreement consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising
therefrom, and each party to this Agreement shall cause its Affiliates and
representatives to consent to waive any conflict of interest arising from such
representation.

 



 

(b) Each party to this Agreement agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of
its Affiliates and representatives, that Bracewell LLP may serve as counsel to
members of the Seller Group, on the one hand, and members of the Company
Group, on the other hand, in connection with the Excluded Legal Proceedings,
and that, following the Closing, Bracewell LLP (or any successor thereof) may
serve as counsel to any member of the Seller Group or any Affiliate or
representative thereof in connection with any such Legal Proceeding (and
furthermore, Bracewell LLP (or any successor thereof) may additionally serve
as counsel to any member of the Company Group in connection with the Excluded
Legal Proceedings pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 10.4(d)_)
notwithstanding such prior representation of any member of the Company Group,
and each party to this Agreement consents thereto and waives any conflict of
interest arising therefrom, and each party to this Agreement shall cause its
Affiliates and representatives to consent to waive any conflict of interest
arising from such representation.

 



 

11.14 _Financing Related Agreements_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Seller agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that
none of the Financing Sources shall have any liability or obligation to the
Seller or any of its Affiliates relating to this Agreement, any related
documentation or any of the transactions contemplated herein or therein
(including any Debt Financing). This _Section 11.14_ is intended to benefit
and may be enforced by any Financing Source and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Seller.
