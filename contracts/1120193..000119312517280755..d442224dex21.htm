</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">12.18 <U>Waiver of Conflicts</U>. Recognizing that WF&amp;G has acted as legal counsel to certain of the Securityholders and the Company,
its Affiliates and the Group Companies prior to the Closing, and that WF&amp;G intends to act as legal counsel to certain of the Securityholders after the Closing, each of the Parent and the Surviving Company (including on behalf of the Group
Companies) hereby waives any conflicts that may arise in connection with WF&amp;G representing any of the Securityholders and/or their respective Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate to the Parent or any Group Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated herein. In addition, all communications involving attorney-client confidences between WF&amp;G and any of the Securityholders and their respective Affiliates in the course of the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to such Securityholder and its Affiliates (and not the Group Companies).&nbsp;Accordingly, the Group
Companies shall not have access to any such communications, or to the files of WF&amp;G relating to such engagement, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing,
(i)&nbsp;the applicable Securityholders (and not the Group Companies) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of the Group Companies shall be a holder thereof, (ii)&nbsp;to the extent that
files of WF&amp;G in respect of such engagement constitute property of the client, only the applicable Securityholders (and not the Group Companies) shall hold such property rights and (iii)&nbsp;WF&amp;G shall not have any duty whatsoever to reveal
or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to any of the Group Companies by reason of any attorney-client relationship between or among WF&amp;G and any of the Group Companies or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, (i)&nbsp;the foregoing provisions of this <U>Section&nbsp;12.18</U> shall not extend to any communication or file not involving the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated this Agreement or any other
agreements contemplated hereby or any claims brought in connection herewith or therewith, and (ii)&nbsp;in the event that a dispute arises between Parent, the Surviving Company or any of the Group Companies and a third party (other than a party to
this Agreement or any of their respective Affiliates) after the Closing, the Surviving Company (including on behalf of the Group Companies) may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by WF&amp;G to
such third party. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">* * * * </P>
