\- vi - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of
September 4, 2017, is made by and among eVestment, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), Nasdaq, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Parent_ "), Echo Holding Company, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Parent (the " _Merger Sub_ "), and Insight Venture
Partners, LLC, solely in its capacity as the representative for the
Securityholders (the " _Representative_ "). The Parent, the Merger Sub and the
Company, and, solely in its capacity as and solely to the extent applicable,
the Representative, shall be referred to herein from time to time as a "
_Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_." Capitalized terms used and not
otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in _Article XI_ below.

WHEREAS, the Parent desires to acquire one hundred percent (100%) of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company in a reverse
subsidiary merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

 

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of the Company, the Parent and the Merger Sub
have each (i) determined that the Merger is fair, advisable and in the best
interests of their respective companies and stockholders and (ii) approved
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; 

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of each of the Company and the Merger Sub
have determined to recommend to their respective stockholders the approval
and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger; and

WHEREAS, the Parent has obtained an insurance policy that provides coverage
for the benefit of the Parent or its designee as the named insured for
breaches of any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
in _Article III_ (the " _R andW Insurance_").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

1.01 _The Merger_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, at the Effective
Time, the Merger Sub shall merge (the " _Merger_ ") with and into the Company
in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ "), whereupon the separate existence of the Merger Sub shall cease, and
the Company shall be the surviving company (the " _Surviving Company_ ").

(b) At the Closing, the Company and the Merger Sub shall cause a certificate
of merger substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto (the " _Certificate
of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware and make   all other filings or recordings required by the DGCL in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or
at such other time as the Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in
the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall succeed to
all of the assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of
and be subject to all of the Liabilities, restrictions, and duties of the
Company and the Merger Sub, all as provided under the DGCL.

 

1.02 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holders thereof:

(a) each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per
share, of the Company (the " _Series A Preferred Stock_ "), issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled, extinguished and
converted into the right to receive, subject to the terms of this Agreement,
an amount in cash equal to the sum of (i) the product obtained by multiplying
the Per Share Closing Cash Consideration by the Applicable Conversion Rate
that applies to such share of Series A Preferred Stock, and (ii) the product
obtained by multiplying the Per Share Additional Merger Consideration by the
Applicable Conversion Rate that applies to such share of Series A Preferred
Stock;

 

(b) each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares)
shall be cancelled, extinguished and converted into the right to receive,
subject to the terms of this Agreement, an amount in cash equal to the sum of
(i) the Per Share Closing Cash Consideration, and (ii) the Per Share
Additional Merger Consideration;

(c) each share of Company Stock, if any, held as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Parent, the Merger Sub or the Company shall be canceled
and extinguished and no payment shall be made with respect thereto (the "
_Excluded Shares_ "); and

 

(d) each share of common stock of the Merger Sub that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Company.

The aggregate consideration to which Company Shareholders become entitled
pursuant to this _Section 1.02_ is referred to herein as the " _Stock Merger
Consideration_."

 

1.03 _Effect on Options_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the
part of the Company or of any Securityholder, (i) each Option that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is either (x) not
then vested (it being understood that an Option that by its terms
vests immediately prior to or upon consummation of the Merger shall be
considered

 



- 2 \-  vested for purposes hereof) or (y) not an In-the-Money Option shall
automatically be canceled and extinguished, no longer be outstanding and cease
to represent the right to acquire shares of Common Stock, without any payment
of any consideration therefor; and (ii) each vested In-the-Money Option that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
canceled and extinguished, no longer be outstanding and cease to represent
the right to acquire shares of Common Stock, and in consideration therefor,
the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the Option Consideration. The Company shall, prior to
the Effective Time, take all actions as are reasonably necessary in order to
effectuate the actions contemplated by this _Section 1.03_ and to ensure that
no holder of Options shall have any rights from and after the Effective Time
with respect to any Options except as expressly provided in this _Section
1.03_; _provided_ , that such actions shall expressly be conditioned upon the
consummation of the Merger and each of the other transactions contemplated
hereby and shall be of no force or effect if this Agreement is terminated.

(b) The Closing Option Consideration payable to the holders of vested In-the-
Money Options pursuant to _Section 1.03(a)_ above shall be paid through the
Companys payroll system promptly following the Effective Time and in no event
later than the next Company payroll date following the fifth day that follows
the Effective Time. Any remaining portion of the Option Consideration payable
to the holders of vested In-the-Money Options shall, at the request of the
Representative, be paid through the Surviving Companys payroll system
promptly following, and in no event later than the next Company payroll
following, the fifth day that follows the applicable time as any such
remaining portion of the Option Consideration becomes payable to such holder,
if any.

 

1.04 _Paying Agent; Exchange of Company Stock_.

 

(a) The Parties hereby appoint Epiq Corporate Restructuring or such other bank
or trust company selected by the Parties that is reasonably acceptable to the
Parties (in such role, the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of distributing
to Company Shareholders (other than holders of Excluded Shares and Dissenting
Shares) the Stock Merger Consideration payable to Company Shareholders
pursuant to _Section 1.02_ in accordance with, and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in, the Paying Agent Agreement. All fees, costs and
expenses of the Paying Agent shall be paid by the Parent.

 

(b) The Parent shall effect, or cause to be effected, the exchange of cash for
the shares of Company Stock that are outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and entitled to payment pursuant to _Section 1.02_. In
connection with such exchange, by no later than ten (10) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, the Parent shall provide to the Paying Agent for
delivery to each Company Shareholder a Letter of Transmittal, substantially in
the form of _Exhibit B_ attached hereto (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "). Upon
the delivery by such Company Shareholder of a duly executed and completed
Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent and surrender to the Paying Agent of
one or more certificates representing all shares of Company Stock held by such
Company Shareholder, if applicable, after the Effective Time, the Paying
Agent shall promptly deliver or cause to be delivered to each such holder the
amount of cash to which such holder is entitled under _Section 1.02_ to the
account(s) and via the method of payment designated by such holder in such
holders Letter of Transmittal; _provided_ , that the Paying Agent shall
deliver or cause to be delivered such amounts on the Closing Date to any

 



- 3 \-  Company Shareholder that has delivered a duly executed and completed Letter
of Transmittal to the Paying Agent and surrendered to the Paying Agent of one
or more certificates representing all shares of Company Stock held by such
Company Shareholder, if applicable, in each case, at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date. Except as provided in the Escrow Agreement
with respect to the Escrow Amount, in no event shall any Company Shareholder
who delivers a Letter of Transmittal be entitled to receive interest on any of
the funds to be received in the Merger. Any Company Stock held by a Company
Shareholder that has delivered a Letter of Transmittal to the Parent pursuant
to this _Section 1.04(b)_ shall not be transferable on the books of the
Company without the Parents prior written consent.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Company Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of the shares of Company Stock
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by Law.

1.05 _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent, the Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any shares of capital stock of any of the foregoing,
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company shall be amended

thereafter amended, subject to _Section 6.03_, in accordance with the
provisions thereof and the DGCL. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of
the Surviving Company shall be amended and restated to be in the form

1.06 _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, until
successors are duly elected, appointed or otherwise designated in accordance
with applicable Law, the directors of the Merger Sub at the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Company, and the officers of the
Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company,
each such initial director and initial officer to hold office in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company as
in effect from and after the Effective Time.

 

1.07 _Closing Calculations_. Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to
the anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Parent a
statement setting forth (a) an estimated consolidated balance sheet of the
Group Companies as of the Reference Time, (b) a good faith calculation of the
Companys estimate of Cash (the " _Estimated Cash_ "), Indebtedness (the "
_Estimated Indebtedness_ "), Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working
Capital_ ") and Transaction Expenses (" _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "),
(c) Tax Savings (the " _Estimated Tax Savings_ ") and (d) the Closing Cash
Consideration, the Closing Payment Amount and the aggregate Closing Option
Consideration (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ "). The Parent may
submit any objections in writing to the Company until 5:00 p.m. New York time
on the Business Day prior to the anticipated Closing Date and the Company will
consider in good faith any revisions proposed by the Parent to the Estimated
Closing Statement. After delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement, the
Parent and its accountants and other representatives shall be

 



- 4 \-  permitted reasonable access to review the Companys and its Subsidiaries
books and records and any work papers (subject to the Parent and its
representatives entering into any reasonable and customary undertakings
required by the Companys accountants in connection therewith) related to the
preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement. The Parent and its accountants
and other representatives may make reasonable inquiries of the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective accountants and employees regarding
questions concerning or disagreements with the Estimated Closing Statement
arising in the course of their review thereof, and the Company shall use its,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use their, commercially reasonable efforts
to cause any such accountants and employees to cooperate with and respond to
such inquiries. The Estimated Closing Statement and the determinations
contained therein shall be prepared in accordance with this Agreement, the
Accounting Principles and the Reference Statement.

1.08 _Final Closing Balance Sheet Calculation_. As promptly as possible, but
in any event within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Parent shall
deliver to the Representative (a) a consolidated balance sheet of the Group
Companies as of the Reference Time (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and (b)
a statement showing the Cash, Indebtedness, Net Working Capital, Transaction
Expenses and Tax Savings (the " _Closing Statement_ "). The Closing Balance
Sheet shall be prepared, and Cash, Indebtedness, Net Working Capital,
Transaction Expenses and Tax Savings shall be determined, in accordance with
this Agreement, the Accounting Principles and the Reference Statement. The
Parties agree that the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and
determining Cash, Indebtedness, Net Working Capital, Transaction Expenses and
Tax Savings and the related purchase price adjustment contemplated by this
_Section 1.08_ is to measure the amount of Cash, Indebtedness, Net Working
Capital, Transaction Expenses and Tax Savings. The Accounting Principles used
to determine the amount of Cash, Indebtedness and Net Working Capital in the
Closing Statement shall not change as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby or any financing or refinancing arrangements entered into
at any time by the Parent or its Affiliates or any other transaction entered
into by the Parent or its Affiliates in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. After delivery of the Closing
Statement, the Representative and its accountants and other representatives
shall be permitted reasonable access to review the Surviving Companys and its
Subsidiaries books and records and any work papers (subject to the
Representative and its representatives entering into any reasonable and
customary undertakings required by the Surviving Companys accountants in
connection therewith) related to the preparation of the Closing Statement.
The Representative and its accountants and other representatives may make
reasonable inquiries of the Parent, the Surviving Company, its Subsidiaries
and their respective accountants and employees regarding questions concerning
or disagreements with the Closing Statement arising in the course of their
review thereof, and the Parent shall use its, and shall cause the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries to use their, commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any such accountants and employees to cooperate with and respond to
such inquiries. If the Representative has any objections to the Closing
Statement, the Representative shall deliver to the Parent a written statement
(an " _Objections Statement_ ") specifying in reasonable detail each item
that the Representative disputes (each, a " _Disputed Item_ ") and the amount
in dispute for each Disputed Item and the reasons supporting the
Representatives positions. If an Objections Statement is not delivered to
the Parent within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery of the
Closing Statement, the Closing Statement shall be final, binding and non-
appealable by the Parties. The Representative and the Parent shall negotiate
in good faith to resolve any Disputed Items, but if they do not reach a final
resolution within fifteen (15) days after the delivery of the Objections 

 



- 5 \-  Statement, the Representative and the Parent shall submit such dispute to a
nationally recognized independent accounting firm reasonably acceptable to the
Parent and the Representative (the " _Dispute Resolution Firm_ "). Any
further submissions to the Dispute Resolution Firm must be written and
delivered to each party to the dispute. The Dispute Resolution Firm shall
consider only those items and amounts that are identified in the Objections
Statement as being Disputed Items and that the Representative and the Parent
were unable to resolve. The Dispute Resolution Firms determination shall be
based solely on the definitions of Cash, Indebtedness, Net Working Capital
and Transaction Expenses and Tax Savings contained herein and the provisions
of this Agreement, including this _Section 1.08_. The Representative and the
Parent shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Dispute
Resolution Firm to resolve all disagreements as soon as practicable. With
respect to each Disputed Item, such determination, if not in accordance with
the position of either the Parent or the Representative, shall not be in
excess of the higher, nor less than the lower of the disputed amounts set
forth in the Closing Statement and the Objections Statement. Further, the
Dispute Resolution Firms determination shall be based solely on the
presentations by the Parent and the Representative that are in accordance
with the terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on
the basis of an independent review). The resolution of the dispute by the
Dispute Resolution Firm shall be final and binding on and non-appealable by
the Parties hereto. The costs and expenses of the Dispute Resolution Firm
shall be allocated by the Dispute Resolution Firm between the Parent, on the
one hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders), on the
other hand, based upon the percentage that the portion of the contested amount
not awarded to each Party bears to the amount actually contested by such
Party. For example, if the Representative claims Closing Cash Consideration
is $1,000 greater than the amount determined by the Parent, and the Parent
contests only $500 of the amount claimed by the Representative, and if the
Dispute Resolution Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding
the Representative (for the benefit of the Securityholders) $300 of the $500
contested, then the costs and expenses of arbitration shall be allocated sixty
percent (60%) ( _i.e._ , 300 ÷ 500) to the Parent and forty percent (40%) (
_i.e._ , 200 ÷ 500) to the Representative (for the benefit of the
Securityholders).

1.09 _Post-Closing Adjustment Payment_.

(a) If the Final Cash Consideration is greater than the Closing Cash
Consideration (the lesser of such excess or the Escrow Amount, the "
_Difference_ "), the Parent shall promptly (but in any event within two (2)
Business Days) pay to (1) the Paying Agent (for distribution to the Company
Shareholders) the Company Shareholder Percentage of the amount of the
Difference by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by the Paying Agent to the Parent and (2) the Surviving
Company (for distribution to the holders of the vested In-the-Money Options
pursuant to _Section 1.03(b)_) the Optionholder Percentage of the amount of
the Difference by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by the Surviving Company. In no event shall the
amount paid by the Parent pursuant to this _Section 1.09_(a) exceed the
Escrow Amount.

(b) If the Final Cash Consideration is less than the Closing Cash
Consideration, the Parent and the Representative (on behalf of the
Securityholders) shall promptly (but in any event within two (2) Business
Days) deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to pay to
the Parent the absolute value of such difference by wire transfer of
immediately available funds from the Escrow Account to an account designated
in writing by the

 



- 6 \-  Parent to the Representative and the Escrow Agent. Absent fraud, the
Securityholders and the Representative shall not have any liability for any
amounts due pursuant to _Section 1.08_ or this _Section 1.09_ except to the
extent of the funds available in the Escrow Account.

(c) _Exhibit E_ sets forth an illustrative statement (the " _Reference
Statement_ ") prepared in good faith by the Company in cooperation with the
Parent setting forth the various line items used (or to be used) in, and
illustrating as of the date set forth therein, the calculation of Cash,
Indebtedness and Net Working Capital prepared and calculated in accordance
with this Agreement.

1.10 _Escrow Account_.

(a) At the Closing, pursuant to _Section 2.02(d)_, the Parent shall deposit
$5,000,000 (such amount the " _Escrow Amount_ ") in immediately available
funds into an escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") to be established and
maintained by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms and conditions of an
escrow agreement based upon the form of _Exhibit F_ attached hereto to be
entered into on the Closing Date by the Parent, the Representative and the
Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). Absent fraud, the Escrow Amount
shall serve as security for, and the sole source of payment of, the Parents
rights pursuant to _Section 1.09_ and _Section 8.02_. All fees, costs and
expenses of the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement shall be paid by
the Parent.

 

(b) Promptly following the determination of the Final Cash Consideration, and
the making of all payments due pursuant to  _Section 1.09_ and _Section
8.02_, if any, and the taking into account the amount, if any, of claims for
indemnification under _Section 8.02_ properly asserted in writing prior to
such date by the Indemnitees but not yet resolved as of the Expiration Date
(such claims, the " _Unresolved Claims_ "), if there are any amounts remaining
in the Escrow Account (the " _Remaining Escrow Amount_ "), then the Parent and
the Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow
Agent to pay to (a) the Paying Agent (for distribution to the Company
Shareholders) the Company Shareholder Percentage of the Remaining Escrow
Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by the Paying Agent to the Escrow Agent and (b) the
Surviving Company (for distribution to the holders of the vested In-the-Money
Options pursuant to _Section 1.03(b)_) the Optionholder Percentage of the
Remaining Escrow Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by the Surviving Company. Upon final resolution
of any Unresolved Claim in respect of which amounts had been retained (to the
extent not utilized to satisfy such Unresolved Claims), the Parent and the
Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
that such amounts shall be deemed to have become Remaining Escrow Amount and
shall be paid in accordance with the process set forth in the preceding
sentence and the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

1.11 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary and to the extent available under Section 262 of the DGCL, any share
of Company Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that is held by a Company Shareholder who did not consent
to or vote (by a valid and enforceable proxy or otherwise) in favor of the
approval of this Agreement, which Company Shareholder complies with all of the
provisions of the DGCL relevant to the exercise and perfection of dissenters
rights (such share

 



- 7 \-  being a " _Dissenting Share_ ," and such Company Shareholder being a "
_Dissenting Stockholder_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive
the consideration to which the holder of such share would be entitled
pursuant to _Section 1.02_ but, rather, shall be converted into the right to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such
Dissenting Share pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. If any Dissenting
Stockholder fails to perfect such stockholders dissenters rights under the
DGCL or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such rights with respect to
any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon automatically
be converted into the right to receive the consideration referred to in
_Section 1.02_, pursuant to the exchange procedures set forth in _Section
1.04_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then the right of a stockholder to be
paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL shall cease. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall give the
Parent (a) written notice of any demand for payment of the fair value of any
shares of Company Stock or any attempted withdrawal of any such demand for
payment and any other instrument served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
the Company relating to any stockholders dissenters rights and (b) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any such demands for payment under the DGCL. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demand for
appraisal with respect to any Dissenting Shares without the prior written
consent of the Parent.

 

1.12 _Withholding_. Each of the Parent, the Paying Agent, the Escrow Agent,
the Surviving Company and the Representative shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code or any other applicable Tax Law.
The Parent shall use reasonable efforts to provide the Representative with
notice, at least ten (10) days prior to the Closing, of any required
withholding. To the extent that any amounts are so deducted or withheld and
timely paid over to the applicable Tax authority, such deducted and withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

material to the Group Companies, taken as a whole. The Company is qualified
to do business and is in good standing (where such concept is recognized) in
every jurisdiction where it is required to qualify, except where the failure
to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a Material Adverse 

 



- 9 \-  Effect. The Company has delivered to the Parent complete copies of the
Organizational Documents of the Company as currently in effect, and the
Company is not in violation of any provision of such Organizational
Documents.

3.02 _Subsidiaries_. _Schedule 3.02_ accurately sets forth each Subsidiary of
the Company, its name, place of incorporation or formation, and if not wholly

thereby. Each Subsidiary is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or

Companies, taken as a whole. Each Subsidiary is qualified to do business and
is in good standing (where such concept is recognized) in every jurisdiction
in which it is required to qualify, except in each such case where the
failure to hold such power and authority, authorizations, licenses and permits
or to be so qualified and in good standing would not have a Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has delivered to the Parent complete copies of the
organizational documents of each of the Subsidiaries as currently in effect,

venture interest or other equity ownership interest in any
corporation, organization or entity that is not a Group Company.

3.03 _Authorization; No Breach; Valid and Binding Agreement_.

 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, have been duly and validly authorized by all requisite corporate

of, or constitute a default under any of the provisions of the certificates of

to which any of the Group Companies is subject or by which any of their

of the representations and warranties contained in clause (ii) or (iv) above
to be true would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

(d) Assuming that this Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of the
other parties hereto, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy Laws, other similar Laws affecting
creditors rights and general principles of equity affecting the availability
of specific performance and other equitable remedies.

(e) The Written Consent, when duly executed, will be sufficient to satisfy
the Shareholder Approval.

for the benefit of such persons), and (ii) the Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by or on behalf of the Company as of the date
hereof (the " _Current Policies_ ") ( _provided_ that the Parent may
substitute such policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred at or prior to the Closing;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Parent shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments for
such insurance to the extent that such premiums exceed three hundred percent
(300%) of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by or on behalf of
the Company for the Current Policies (the " _Premium Amount_ "), and if such
premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Amount, then
the Parent shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that provide
the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium
Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Closing and in
satisfaction of the Parents foregoing obligations under this _Section
6.03_, each of the Parent and the Company shall be permitted to purchase (at
the Parents expense, and without duplication) a six (6) year "tail" prepaid
directors and officers liability insurance policy (the " _D andO Tail_"),
effective as of the Closing, providing, for a period of six (6) years after
the Closing, the coverage and amounts, and terms and

 



- 33 \-  conditions, contemplated by the foregoing sentence of this _Section
6.03(b)_; _provided_ that the Company shall not pay an aggregate amount for
such DandO Tail in excess of the Premium Amount. If such premiums for such DandO
Tail would require an expenditure that exceeds the Premium Amount, then the
Parent or the Surviving Company may obtain, in satisfaction of the foregoing,
a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount. From and after the Closing, the Parent shall (and/or shall cause the
Group Companies or its other subsidiaries or Affiliates, as applicable, to)
continue to honor its obligations under any such insurance procured pursuant
to this _Section 6.03(b)_, and shall not cancel (or permit to be canceled) or
take (or cause to be taken) any action or omission that would reasonably be
expected to result in the cancellation thereof.

 

(c) The Parent agrees to pay, or to cause the Surviving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to pay, all expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be
incurred by the DandO Indemnified Parties in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided for in this _Section 6.03_ to the extent such
enforcement results in a final, non-appealable judgment in favor of
the applicable DandO Indemnified Parties.

(d) If the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns proposes to
(i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and the Surviving Company
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision
shall be made prior to or concurrently with the consummation of such
transaction so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Company shall,
from and after the consummation of such transaction, honor the
indemnification and other obligations set forth in this _Section 6.03_.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.03_ shall survive the consummation of
the Merger and the Effective Time and (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Party, and his or her
successors, heirs and representatives and shall be binding on all successors
and assigns of the Surviving Company and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have by Contract or otherwise.

 

6.04 _Efforts to Consummate_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, from the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, each of the Parent and the Merger Sub shall
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the satisfaction, but
not waiver, of the Closing conditions set forth in _Article VII_ ); _provided_
that such efforts shall not require agreeing to any obligations or
accommodations (financial or otherwise) binding on the Parent or the Merger
Sub in the event the Closing does not occur. At the Parents reasonable
request, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver
such notices, or to obtain such third party consents or approvals, as may be
required by any Lease or Material Contract in connection with the completion
of the transactions contemplated hereby;  _provided_ that in no event shall
any Group Company be required to undertake any material expenses or
obligations in connection therewith other than (i) expenses that are funded or
reimbursed by the Parent or (ii) obligations that are not effective prior to
the Effective Time.

 



- 34 \- 6.05 _Conduct of Business of Parent_. Before the Effective Time, the Parent
shall not take, or agree or commit to take, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Affiliates and representatives not
to take or agree or commit to take, directly or indirectly, any action that
would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give the Company, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Parents or its
Subsidiaries operations. The Parent and its Subsidiaries shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over their respective businesses, assets and operations.

 

6.06 _Release_. Effective as of and conditioned upon the Closing, the Group
Companies and their respective successors and assigns (each, a " _Releasing
Person_ ") hereby fully and unconditionally release, acquit and forever
discharge the current and former equityholders and controlling persons of the
Company, and each of their respective controlling Affiliates, each solely in
their capacities as such (each, a " _Released Person_ "), from any and all
manner of actions, causes of action, claims, obligations, demands, damages,
costs, expenses, compensation or other relief, whether known or
unknown, whether in law or equity, arising out of or relating to or accruing
from their relationship with the Company prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the foregoing, this _Section 6.06_ shall not (a)
apply to the rights of a Releasing Person under any Transaction Document, (b)
relieve any Released Person of its obligations and liabilities under any
Transaction Document, (c) apply to the rights and obligations under commercial
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business between a
Releasing Person, on the one hand, and a Released Person, on the other hand or
(d) limit any Releasing Persons rights with respect to fraud by a Released
Person.

 

6.07 _280G Vote_. The Company shall submit to a vote of the Company
Shareholders for their determination all payments or benefits that in the
absence of such a vote could reasonably be viewed as "parachute payments"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations
thereunder) made to any individuals that are "disqualified
individuals" (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code and the
regulations thereunder), which shareholder vote shall be conducted in a manner
that is intended to meet the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code
and the regulations thereunder, and shall be in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Parent. Prior to such vote, the Company shall obtain
waivers from each disqualified individual of some or all of such disqualified
individuals parachute payments such that all remaining payments and/or
benefits, if any, shall not constitute "excess parachute payments" within the
meaning of section 280G(b)(1) of the Code with respect to such disqualified
individual or, in the absence of the shareholder approval referred to in the
immediately preceding sentence, shall not be payable to or retained by such
disqualified individual to the extent such excess parachute payments would not
be deductible by reason of the application of Section 280G of the Code or
would result in the imposition of the excise tax under Section 4999 of the
Code on such disqualified individual.

contained in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document shall survive
the Closing. Unless otherwise indicated, the covenants set forth in this
Agreement that by their terms are required to be performed exclusively before
the Closing shall survive the Closing until the date on which the
payment required to be made pursuant to _Section 1.09_ has been made (the "
_Expiration Date_ "); _provided_ that, if a claim of indemnification for a
breach of a pre-Closing covenant is given under _Section 8.02_ prior to the
Expiration Date, then such claim will be preserved until such claim is finally
resolved. Unless otherwise indicated, the covenants and agreements set forth
in this Agreement that by their terms are required to be performed in whole or
in part after the Closing shall survive the Closing until they have been
performed or satisfied.

8.02 _Indemnification for Breach of Pre-Closing Covenant_. From and after the
Effective Time and until the Expiration Date, Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates, officers, directors, stockholders, agents and other
representatives (the " _Indemnitees_ "), shall be indemnified and held

suffered by any of them as a result of, relating to or arising out of any
breach by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company of any of
its covenants contained herein that by its terms is required to be performed
before the Closing. The aggregate amount of Losses with respect to which all
Indemnitees may be entitled under this _Section 8.02_ shall not exceed the
Escrow Amount. 

8.03 _Claims Procedures_. Any claim by an Indemnitee brought pursuant to
_Section 8.02_ (a " _Claim_ ") shall be asserted by the Indemnitee by giving
the Representative prompt written notice thereof following the date on which
Indemnitee becomes aware of such breach; _provided_

 



- 38 \-  that any failure to provide such notice shall not prejudice an Indemnitees
right to bring such Claim except to the extent that such failure shall have
materially prejudiced the Representative. Such notice by the Indemnitee shall
describe the Claim in reasonable detail and shall indicate the estimated
amount, if reasonably practicable and to the extent known, of the Loss that
has been or may be sustained by the Indemnitee as a result of such breach.
After its receipt of such notice, the Representative shall have a reasonable
opportunity to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to
the Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of
the Claim and the Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Representatives
investigation by giving such information and assistance as the Representative
or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request.

 

8.04 _Limitations_.

(a) All amounts recoverable in respect of any Claim shall be limited to the
amount of any Loss that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance
proceeds, indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually received
by the Indemnitee from a third party in respect of any such Claim.

(b) All amounts recoverable in respect of any Claim shall be reduced by an
amount equal to any Tax benefit actually realized as a result of such Loss by
the Indemnitee.

(c) No Losses shall be recoverable under  _Section 8.02_ that constitute
punitive damages or damages that are not reasonably foreseeable except for any
such damages or Losses awarded or granted by a Governmental Entity in
connection with a claim by a third party.

Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice delivered to the Parent
on the date the Closing is required to occur under _Section 2.01_ that the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ are satisfied and if specific
performance were to be granted the Company stands ready, willing and able to
consummate the Merger, then the Parent Cure Period with respect to a failure
of the Parent to deliver the Merger Consideration or the payments contemplated
by _Section 2.02_ at the Closing as required hereunder shall be deemed to be
five (5) Business Days rather than twenty (20) Business Days unless otherwise
agreed to in writing by the Company;

(e) by the Parent or the Company, if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not have been consummated on or prior to March 4, 2018 (such

Date_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Party seeking to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(e)_ shall not have ( _provided_ that

(f) by either the Company or the Parent if (i) there shall be any Law that
makes consummation of the Merger illegal or (ii) any Governmental Entity
having competent jursidiction shall have issued an Order or taken any other

force and effect (other than the penultimate sentence of _Section 5.02_, this
_Section 9.02_, _Section 10.01_, and _Article XI_ and _Article XII_ hereof,
which shall survive the termination of this Agreement (other than the
provisions of _Section 12.17_, which shall terminate)), and there shall be no
liability on the part of either the Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company, the
Representative or the Securityholders to one another; _provided_ that no such
termination shall relieve any Party hereto from any liability or damages
resulting from a willful or intentional breach prior to such termination of
any of such Partys representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement. Without limiting the Companys rights under any other
provision of this Agreement (including the Companys right to specific
performance pursuant to _Section 12.17_), in the event that Parent and/or
Merger Sub

 



- 40 \-  willfully and intentionally breaches its obligation to consummate the
Closing at such a time when it is obligated to consummate the Closing, then
the Company may, on behalf of the Securityholders, petition a court to award
damages in connection with any such breach. The Company may, additionally, on
behalf of the Securityholders, enforce such award and accept damages for such
breach; _provided_ that while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific
performance and monetary damages in accordance with _Section 12.17_, in no
event shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of
specific performance that results in the Closing occurring and money damages.

Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination
of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, Action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, Action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, Action or proceeding that

injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and hereby waives (x) any
defenses in any Action for an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief, including the defense that the other parties have an
adequate remedy at Law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity, and (y) any requirement
under Law to post a bond, undertaking or other security as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

12.18 _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that WFandG has acted as legal counsel
to certain of the Securityholders and the Company, its Affiliates and the

Parent and the Surviving Company (including on behalf of the Group Companies)
hereby waives any conflicts that may arise in connection with WFandG
representing any of the Securityholders and/or their respective Affiliates
after the Closing as such representation may relate to the Parent or any Group
Company in connection with the transactions contemplated herein. In addition,
all communications involving attorney-client confidences between WFandG and any
of the Securityholders and their respective Affiliates in the course of the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to
such Securityholder and its Affiliates (and not the Group Companies).
Accordingly, the Group Companies shall not have access to any such
communications, or to the files of WFandG relating to such engagement, whether
or not the Closing shall have occurred. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) the applicable Securityholders
(and not the Group Companies) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client
privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of the Group Companies
shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of WFandG in respect
of such engagement constitute property of the client, only the applicable
Securityholders (and not the Group Companies) shall hold such property rights
and (iii) WFandG shall not have any duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any
such attorney-client communications or files to any of the Group Companies by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between or among WFandG and any of
the Group Companies or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, (i) the foregoing provisions of this _Section 12.18_ shall not
extend to any communication or file not involving the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated this Agreement
or any other agreements contemplated hereby or any claims brought in
connection herewith or therewith, and (ii) in the event that a dispute arises
between Parent, the Surviving Company or any of the Group Companies and a
third party (other than a party to this Agreement or any of their respective
Affiliates) after the Closing, the Surviving Company (including on behalf of
the Group Companies) may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by WFandG to such third party.
