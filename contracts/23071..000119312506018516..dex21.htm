Merger and without any further action on the part of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or any holder of any capital stock of such Persons:



(a) _Conversion of Securities_. Each share of the Companys common stock, par
value $0.01 per share (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "
_Shares_ ") (other than Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.1(b))
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
converted into the right to receive $11.00 per Share in cash, without interest
(the " _Per Share Amount_ ") (the aggregate cash amount payable pursuant to
this Section 3.1(a) being hereinafter referred to as the " _Merger
Consideration_ ").



(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and any Shares held
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company, Parent or any
Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent (including Merger Sub) shall
automatically be retired and shall cease to be outstanding, and no Merger
Consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor or in
consideration thereof.



(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Stock_. Each share of common stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one validly issued, fully-paid and non-assessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.



 

3 (d) _Company Options, Etc_.



(i) Prior to or simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, the Board
of Directors of the Company and the Compensation and Stock Option Committee
of the Board have adopted resolutions with respect to the Companys 1990
Performance Equity Plan, 2000 Performance Equity Plan and 1990 Outside
Director Stock Option Plan and any other Company Compensation and Benefit
Plan under which any option or other right to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock has been granted (collectively, the " _Company Stock Option Plans_ ") to
implement the provisions of Section 3.1(d)(ii). 



(ii) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option or other right to acquire
shares of Company Common Stock, whether or not presently exercisable,
(collectively, the " _Company Options_ ") granted under the Company Stock
Option Plans shall cease to be a right to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock and shall become a right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
product of (1) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Amount over the exercise
price per share of the Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option and (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant
to the unexercised portion of such Company Option; and the Company Stock
Option Plans shall terminate, and no Person shall thereafter be granted any
rights under such Plans. 



(iii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company (A) shall use reasonable best
efforts to take such actions as shall be necessary or desirable to provide
that the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to any applicable federal or
state income tax deductions attributable to the payments to holders of
Company Options as provided above, and (B) shall cooperate with Parent and
Merger Sub in providing notices and other communications to holders of Company
Options regarding the settlement of the Company Options as provided above.



(iv) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.1(d) shall be subject to
any required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid at or as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, but in any event within seven days
following the Effective Time, without interest. 



As used herein, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation
(including not-for-profit corporation), general or limited partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association,
organization or other entity of any kind or nature.



3.2 _Exchange of Certificates for Cash_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of
Shares and holders of Company Options and for exchange in accordance with
this Article III through the Exchange Agent, the Merger Consideration and the
aggregate consideration to which holders of Company Options shall become
entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(d) (such Merger Consideration and
consideration relating to Company Options, together with any interest earned
thereon, being hereinafter



 

4 referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions to be given by Parent, deliver the cash (excluding
any interest earned thereon) out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this
Agreement; _provided __,_ that Parent may direct the Exchange Agent to invest
the Exchange Fund in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America or in commercial paper obligations rated P-1 or A-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. Any interest or other income resulting from such investments
shall be promptly paid to Parent.



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ "): (i) a letter of
transmittal (which letter shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to such Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form); and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
the portion of the Merger Consideration payable to such holder in accordance
with Section 3.1(a). Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate for
cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and
such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive, in exchange therefor,
the portion of the Merger Consideration payable to such holder in accordance
with Section 3.1(a) (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings) in
respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be
paid or will accrue on the portion of the Merger Consideration payable upon
surrender of any Certificate. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, such
portion of the Merger Consideration may be paid to the transferee if the
Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been
paid.



(c) _Stock Transfer Books_. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of the Shares thereafter on the records of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to the
Shares represented thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by
applicable Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
duly presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be
exchanged as provided in Section 3.2(b).



(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to Parent, upon its written demand therefor, and any such holders that have
not theretofore exchanged Certificates pursuant to this Article III
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the portion of the Merger
Consideration to which they are entitled. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by such holders as of the date that is immediately prior
to such date that such amount would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity shall, if and to



 

5 the extent permitted by applicable Law, be unconditionally and irrevocably
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims or
interests of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or
any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of the Shares for any
amount properly delivered to a public official as required pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.



(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the portion of the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Shares formerly represented thereby.



(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent may deduct and withhold from the portion of the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Shares pursuant to this
Article III such amounts, without duplication, as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
applicable Tax Law. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be, so deducts and withholds such amounts, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the Shares in respect of which Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall make such deduction and
withholding.



3.3 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, if after the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding Shares shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction, then the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent
items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the
holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such action, and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of
such event, be the Merger Consideration, or such other dependent items, as
applicable, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this Section 3.3.



3.4 _Finestar Warrant_. As of the Effective Time, if the Finestar Warrant
shall not have been previously exercised in full, the Surviving Corporation
shall, in accordance with the terms of the Finestar Warrant, enter into a
supplemental agreement providing that the holder of the Finestar Warrant shall
be entitled to receive, and the Finestar Warrant shall thereafter represent
the right to receive (upon due exercise and payment of the exercise price),
in lieu of the shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the
Finestar Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Date, the amount of Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to the Merger in respect of such number of
shares of Company Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock into which the Finestar Warrant would otherwise have been
exercisable absent consummation of the Merger. As used herein, the term "
_Finestar Warrant_ " shall mean Warrant No. CS-1 of the Company issued on
January 15, 2002 to Finestar International Limited.



 

6 3.5 _Convertible Notes_. As of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation,
shall, in accordance with the Indenture, enter into a supplemental indenture
(which indenture shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 as in
effect at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture) providing that
the Convertible Notes shall be convertible into, in lieu of the shares of
Company Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes
immediately prior to the Effective Date, the amount of Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to the Merger in respect of such number of shares of Company
Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock

ARTICLE IV



_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_



4.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. The Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:



(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification; Organizational Documents_.



(i) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is an entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions
that recognize such concept) under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of
organization and has all requisite corporate (or similar) power and authority
to own, license and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as presently conducted, except where the failure to be so organized,
existing or in good standing or to have such power and authority has not had,
and could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties and assets or the conduct of its business requires
such qualification or licensure, except where the failure to be so qualified
or licensed or in good standing has not had, and could not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.



 

7 As used herein, the term " _Subsidiary_ " shall mean, with respect to any
particular Person, any entity, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of
which a majority of the outstanding securities or ownership interests having
by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of
directors or other Persons performing similar functions is directly or
indirectly owned or controlled by such Person or by one or more of its
Subsidiaries or by such Person and any one or more of its Subsidiaries.



As used herein, the term " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " shall mean a
material adverse effect on the business, operations, assets, liabilities,
financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the
following shall be deemed in and of themselves, either alone or in
combination, to constitute, and none of the following shall be taken into
account in determining whether there has been a Company Material Adverse
Effect: (i) any changes in United States generally accepted accounting
principles (" _U.S. GAAP_ "); (ii) changes in general economic conditions in
the United States or the global economy; (iii) changes (including changes in
Law) affecting the industry in which the Company operates in general, to the
extent the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are not
disproportionately affected thereby; (iv) any adverse change, effect, event,
occurrence, state of facts or development (including any cancellations of or
delays in customer orders, any reduction in sales or results of operations,
any disruption in supplier, distributor, partner or similar relationships or
any loss of employees) attributable to the announcement or pendency of the
Merger; or (v) any action required to be taken pursuant to this Agreement or
by or at the request of Parent or Merger Sub. The parties agree that the mere
fact of (A) a decrease in the market price or an increase or decrease in the
trading volume of the Company Common Stock or (B) the failure of the Company
to meet internal projections or published revenues or earnings forecasts shall
not by itself constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect, but the reasons
for or causes of such events (to the extent not due to the announcement or
pendency of the Merger) may constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(ii) The Company has heretofore made available to Parent true and correct
copies of the Companys articles of incorporation and by-laws, each as amended
through the date hereof. _Schedule 4.1(a)(ii)_ of the disclosure schedules
delivered to Parent by the Company on or prior to the date hereof (the "
_Company Disclosure Schedules_ ") sets forth a true and correct list of all
Subsidiaries of the Company, the jurisdictions in which such Subsidiaries are
organized and the percent of the equity interest therein owned by the Company
and any other Subsidiary of the Company or by any other Person, as applicable.



(b) _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of 80,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.01 (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ "). As of
the close of business on December 31, 2005, there were outstanding (i)
40,244,326 shares of Company Common Stock (including 279,575 shares subject
to restrictions under the Company Stock Option Plans), (ii) no shares of
Company Preferred Stock, (iii) Company Options to purchase an aggregate of
4,897,492 shares of Company Common Stock at a weighted average exercise price

8 exercise price of $10.73 per share and (v) $90 million principal amount of

Company Common Stock. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and all of the shares of Company Common Stock that may be
issued pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plans, the Convertible Notes and
the Finestar Warrant have been duly authorized and will be, when issued in

and nonassessable. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.1(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedules, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of each of the Companys Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and are
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and all such shares are owned
by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company free and clear of any Lien
(excluding any securities Law general restrictions on transfer). Except as set
forth in the second sentence of this Section 4.1(b) and for changes since
December 31, 2005 resulting from any exercise of Company Options outstanding
as of December 31, 2005, conversion of the Convertible Notes or exercise of
the Finestar Warrant, there are no outstanding shares of capital stock or
voting securities of the Company. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.1(b)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedules and other than pursuant to (i) the Companys
Rights Agreement, dated as of November 21, 1989, as amended as of October 22,
2004 (the " _Rights Agreement_ "); (ii) the Company Options outstanding as of
December 31, 2005; and (iii) the Convertible Notes and the Finestar Warrant,
there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants,
conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase
rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments to issue or to sell any shares
of capital stock or other securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that have been issued or granted by the Company or such
Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire,
any securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. _Schedule 4.1(b)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedules sets forth a true and correct list, as of
December 31, 2005, of the Company Options, together with the numbers of
shares covered thereby, dates of grant thereof and the exercise prices
therefor. Except for the Convertible Notes, the Company does not have any
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other debt obligations the holders of
which have the right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable for

any matter (" _Voting Debt_ "). No Subsidiary of the Company owns any Company
Common Stock.



(c) _Corporate Authority_. The Company has the requisite corporate power and
authority, and has taken all corporate action necessary in order, to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby, except for obtaining the Company Required
Statutory Approvals and, with respect to the Merger, the receipt of the
Company Requisite Vote. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each
of Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except
as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors rights and except for general equity principles
(the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ "). At a meeting duly called,
convened and held, the Companys Board of Directors unanimously adopted
resolutions: (i) approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger; (ii) declaring that this 



 

9 Agreement is advisable; (iii) stating that the terms of the Merger are fair
to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders; and (iv)
recommending that the Companys stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement
and the Merger (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ").

Entity_ "), in connection with the Companys execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, other than those notices, reports,
registrations or other filings and consents, approvals, permits and
authorizations the failure of which to make or obtain has not had, and could
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect or would not prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby will not (A) constitute or result in a breach
or violation of either the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the
Company, (B) except as set forth on  _Schedule 4.1(d)(ii)(B)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedules, require any consent or other action by any Person under,

by which it, or any of its properties or assets, is otherwise bound, (C)
assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.1(d)(i),
contravene or conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any Law or
(D) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of each of clauses
(B) through (D) above, for any failure to obtain consent, contravention,
conflict, breach, violation, default, termination, cancellation, acceleration
or creation or imposition of a Lien that has not had, and could not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect or would not prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. 



 

10 (e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.



(i) The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_SEC_ "), the forms, reports and other documents required to be filed by it
since December 31, 2002 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ "), and the Exchange Act (any such forms, reports and other
documents, including any amendments of or supplements thereto, filed with or
furnished to the SEC by the Company prior to the date hereof, the " _Company
Reports_ "). The Company Reports, when filed, were in compliance in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations thereunder. None of the
Company Reports, as of the filing date or, if amended, as of the date the
last amendment was filed, contained any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.



(ii) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and schedules
thereto) fairly presented, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of its date, and
each of the consolidated statements of income (loss) and consolidated
statements of cash flows included in or incorporated by reference into the
Company Reports (including any related notes and schedules thereto) fairly
presented, in all material respects, the consolidated results of operations
and cash flows, as the case may be, of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements,
to the absence of notes, similar presentation items and normal year-end audit
adjustments), in each case in accordance with U.S. GAAP consistently applied
during the periods presented, except as may have been noted therein or, in the
case of unaudited interim financial statements, as may have been permitted by
Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act.



(iii) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries, is made known to the Companys
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others
within those entities. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective
in timely alerting the Companys principal executive officer and principal
financial officer to material information required to be included in the
Companys periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.



(iv) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintained
a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act) (" _internal controls_ "). Such internal
controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of the
Companys financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S.
GAAP, including reasonable assurance (i) that receipts and expenditures of the
Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the Company and transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP and
(ii) regarding prevention or timely detection of any unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of Company assets that could have a material
effect on the



 

11 Companys financial statements. The Companys management, with the
participation of the Companys principal executive and financial officers,
has completed its assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal
controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (" _SOX_ ") for the year ended
December 31, 2004, and such assessment concluded that such internal controls
were effective using the framework specified in the Companys Form 10-K filed
on March 16, 2005. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, to the Companys
auditors and audit committee (x) any significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (y) any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in internal controls. The Company has made available to
Parent a summary of any such disclosure made by its management to the
Companys auditors and audit committee since December 31, 2002.



(v) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.1(e)(v)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, since December 31, 2002, (i) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the Companys knowledge, any director, officer, employee,
auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has received any written complaint, allegation, assertion,
or claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in improper
or illegal accounting or auditing practices or maintains improper or
inadequate internal accounting controls and (ii) no attorney representing the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of U.S.
federal or state securities Laws, a material breach of fiduciary duty or
similar material violation by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective officers, director, employees or agents to the chief legal
counsel or the chief executive officer of the Company, the Board of Directors
of the Company or any member or committee thereof.



(vi) As used herein, the term " _knowledge_ " or any similar formulation shall
mean the actual knowledge of, with respect to the Company, only those persons
set forth on _Schedule 4.1(e)(vi)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules and,
with respect to Parent, only those persons set forth on _Schedule 4.1(e)(vi)_
of the disclosure schedules delivered to the Company by Parent on or prior to
the date hereof (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedules_ "). 



(vii) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any executive officer (as defined in
Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of the Company. The Company has
not, since the enactment of SOX, taken any action prohibited by Section 402
of SOX.



(f) _No Undisclosed Material Liabilities_. Except as set forth on _Schedule
4.1(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules, as reflected on the consolidated

Company, there are no liabilities or obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether accrued, contingent, absolute or otherwise, other than
liabilities or obligations: (i) under existing Contracts of the Company and
its Subsidiaries that were entered into in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices and where



 

12 neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in material breach of its
obligations thereunder; (ii) incurred in the ordinary course of business

this Agreement and in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

Reports, as contemplated by this Agreement or as set forth on  _Schedule

Company in its accounting methods, principles or practices except for any such
change required by reason of a concurrent change in U.S. GAAP; (iii) any
revaluation by the Company of any material asset (including any writing-down
of the value of inventory or writing-off of notes or accounts receivable),
other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;
(iv) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or distribution
in respect of any capital stock of the Company or any redemption, purchase or

securities; (v) any amendment of any material term of any outstanding security
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (vi) any settlement or compromise
of any material litigation, action or claim; (vii) any establishment or
material amendment of any bonus, insurance, severance, deferred compensation,
pension, retirement, profit sharing, stock option, stock purchase or other

to become payable to any officers or key employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, except for salary increases and benefit accruals pursuant to
the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans in the ordinary course
of business; (viii) any incurrence, assumption or guarantee by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries of any indebtedness for borrowed money other than in
the ordinary course of business and in amounts and on terms consistent with
past practice; (ix) any creation or other incurrence by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries of any Lien on any material asset other than in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice; (x) any making of any

(h) _Litigation_. Except as disclosed in the Company Reports or as set forth
on _Schedule 4.1(h)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules, there are no civil,
criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, investigations or
proceedings (collectively, " _Litigation Claims_ ") pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or, to the knowledge of the
Company, pending or threatened against any present or former officer,
director or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before any
court or arbitrator or before or by any Governmental Entity that, if adversely
determined or resolved, could reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or that seek to prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Merger.



 

13 (i) _Employee Benefits_.



(i) As used herein, the term " _Company Compensation and Benefit Plan_ " shall
mean any written or oral bonus, deferred compensation, pension, retirement,
profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee stock ownership, stock bonus, stock
purchase, change in control, retention, restricted stock, stock option,
employment, termination, severance, compensation, medical, health, employee
assistance program, disability or sick leave, workers compensation,
supplemental unemployment benefits, post-employment or retirement benefits
(including compensation, pension, health, medical or life insurance benefits)
or other compensation or benefit plan, including each "employee benefit plan,"
within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), that covers current or former
employees or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and is
maintained, administered or contributed to by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or with respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has any liability. The Company has made available to Parent true and correct
copies of all material Company Compensation and Benefit Plans (and, if
applicable, related trust or funding agreements or insurance policies).



(ii) Each of the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans has been
maintained in compliance in all material respects with its terms and with the
requirements prescribed by any and all applicable Laws (including, if
applicable, ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ ")). There has been no amendment to, written interpretation of or
announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or any Subsidiary
relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any
Company Compensation and Benefit Plan that could reasonably be expected to
increase materially the expense of maintaining such Company Compensation and
Benefit Plan above the level of expense incurred in respect thereof for the
most recent fiscal year ended prior to the date hereof. Each
Company Compensation and Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension benefit
plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a " _Pension Plan_ ") and
that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
has received a favorable determination letter (or opinion letter, if
applicable) from the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") and, to the
Companys knowledge, nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to
act, that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such
qualification. The Company has provided (or made available to) Parent with the
most recent determination letter (or opinion letter, if applicable) of the IRS
relating to each such Pension Plan. 



(iii) No Company Compensation and Benefit Plan that is a Pension Plan is
subject to the funding rules of Part 3 of Title I of ERISA or is a
"multiemployer plan," as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

Schedules, (A) all contributions required to be made by the Company or its
Subsidiaries to any Company Compensation and Benefit Plan under the terms of
such Plan or under U.S. Law or any other applicable Law have been made or have
been accrued on the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or
incorporated by reference in the Company Reports and



 

14 (B) all unfunded benefit obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under
any Company Compensation and Benefit Plan have been accounted for by reserves
or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with U.S. GAAP on the most
recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the
Company Reports.



(v) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries has any current or
projected liability with respect to retiree health and life benefits under
any Company Compensation and Benefit Plan subject to U.S. Law, except for
benefits required to avoid excise tax under Code Section 4980B or, as set
forth on _Schedule 4.1(i)(v)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules, under any
other applicable Law requiring continuation of health coverage.



(vi) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.1(i)(vi)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedules: neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder will (A) result

of the vesting or timing of payment of any compensation or benefits payable to
or in respect of any participant under a Company Compensation and Benefit
Plan; or (B) result in or satisfy a condition to the payment of compensation
that would, in combination with any other payment, result in an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code.



(vii) No transaction prohibited by Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code has occurred with respect to any employee benefit plan or arrangement
that is covered by Title I of ERISA, which transaction has or will cause the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any liability under ERISA, the
Code or otherwise, excluding transactions effected pursuant to and in
compliance with a statutory or administrative exemption and transactions that
have not had, and could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(viii) The Company and its Subsidiaries have employment policies and practices
that are in compliance in all material respects with all currently applicable
Laws respecting employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment, wages, hours and immigration.

Schedules or as has not had, and could not reasonably be expected to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect, with respect to each Company Compensation
and Benefit Plan covering employees outside of the United States (each, an "
_International Plan_ "), (A) each International Plan has been maintained in
compliance in all material respects with its terms and with the
requirements prescribed by any and all applicable statutes, orders, rules and
regulations (including any special provisions relating to qualified plans
where such Plan was intended to so qualify) and has been maintained in good
standing with applicable regulatory authorities and (B) as of September 30,
2005, the sum of (to the extent applicable to a particular Plan) (i) the fair
market value of the assets of such Plan to the extent funded, (ii) the
liability of each insurer for such Plan to the extent insured, and (iii) the
book reserve established for such Plan to the extent neither funded nor
insured, together in each case with any accrued contributions, premium
payments or benefit accruals, is sufficient to provide for the Projected
Benefit Obligation as defined by SFAS 87, with respect to all current and
former participants in each such Plan



 

15 according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used (to
the extent the assumptions comply with SFAS 87) and no transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall cause the sum of each such Plans assets,
insured obligations or reserves to be less than such Plans benefit
obligations. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Affiliate_ " shall mean,
with respect to any Person, any other Person directly or indirectly
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such Person.



(x) Simultaneously with or prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Board
of Directors of the Company and the Compensation and Stock Option Committee
of the Board have adopted resolutions approving the 2006 Executive Incentive
Plan, which plan is set forth on _Schedule 4.1(i)(x)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedules (the " _Executive Incentive Plan_ ").



(xi) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
except as ERISA and any other Laws applicable to the Company Compensation and
Benefits Plans are implicated by Sections 4.1(d), (e), (f), (g) or (h), the
representations and warranties contained in this Section 4.1(i) constitute
the sole representations and warranties of the Company with respect to ERISA
and any other Laws applicable to the Company Compensation and Benefits Plans.



(j) _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. Except as disclosed in the Company
Reports or as set forth on _Schedule 4.1(j)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has violated or
failed to comply with any Law, and to the knowledge of the Company, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is under investigation with respect
to or been threatened to be charged with or given notice of any violation of
any Law, except for any such violations or failures to comply that have not
had, and could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of its

provided that prior to the Companys furnishing any confidential information
to such party, such party shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement

Superior Proposal or (ii) intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(f) and enter into an agreement, letter of intent or similar

modification of such Proposal shall result in a new three-Business Day
period), and Parent does not make, during such three-Business Day period(s),
an irrevocable offer that the Companys Board of Directors shall have
concluded, in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, is at least as favorable (taking into

Company pursuant to this Section 6.2(b), the Company shall, and shall cause
its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall, in accordance with the

Person (or its agents or advisors) in possession of confidential information

with a potential sale of the Company to return or destroy all such information
(including any such information incorporated into any analysis prepared by
any such Persons or any of their advisors) and shall terminate any access such
Person may have been given by the Company or its Representatives to any

ARTICLE VIII



_TERMINATION_



8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding any
requisite approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby by the stockholders of the Company:



(a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Boards of Directors
of each of Parent and the Company; or



 

38 (b) by either Parent or the Company, if:



(i) the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the date that is
six months after the date of this Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate under this Section
8.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any of
its obligations, including, without limitation, its obligations under Section
6.4, under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure
of the consummation of the Merger to occur on or before the Termination Date;
_provided_ , _further_ , that, if the regulatory process necessary for a
decision by the applicable Governmental Entity with respect to any antitrust
clearance included in the Company Required Statutory Approvals or Parent
Required Statutory Approvals has not been completed, such Termination Date
may, at the option of the Company exercised in writing, be extended for a
period of up to 30 days; or



(ii) there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the Merger illegal or
otherwise prohibited or if any court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, judgment, decree,
ruling, injunction or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting or materially altering the terms of the Merger and such
order, judgment, decree, ruling, injunction or other action shall have become
final and non-appealable, except that no party may terminate pursuant to this
Section 8.1(b)(ii) unless such party shall have complied with its obligations
under Section 6.4; or



(iii) the Companys Stockholders Meeting (including any adjournment thereof)
shall have concluded and the Company Requisite Vote shall not have been
obtained; or



(c) by Parent, if (i) an Adverse Recommendation Change has been made (it being
understood, however, that, for all purposes of this Agreement, the fact that
the Company has provided any Person with information regarding the Company or
has entered into discussions or negotiations with such Person as permitted by
this Agreement shall not be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change) or (ii)
the Company shall have violated or breached, in any material respect, its
obligations under Section 6.2 or Section 6.3; or



(d) by the Company, in the event of a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any
representation, warranty or agreement contained herein where such breach would
give rise to the failure of the condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) and
such condition is incapable of being satisfied by the Termination Date; or



(e) by Parent, in the event of a breach by the Company of any representation,
warranty or agreement contained herein where such breach would give rise to
the failure of the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) and such condition
is incapable of being satisfied by the Termination Date; or



(f) by the Company, if (i) the Board of Directors of the Company has
authorized the Company to enter into a written agreement concerning a Superior
Proposal and (ii) the Company shall have complied with Section 6.2
(including Section 6.2(b) and each proviso therein applicable to clause (B)
of Section 6.2(b)) and paid any amounts due pursuant to Section 8.3(a) or
Section 8.3(b) in accordance with the terms, and at the times, specified
therein. 



8.2 _Effects of Termination_. Except as provided in the Confidentiality
Agreement and provisions of this Agreement relating thereto, in the event of
the termination of



 

39 this Agreement pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void, there shall be no liability under this
Agreement on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any of their
respective officers or directors and all rights and obligations of the parties
hereto shall cease, subject to the sole and exclusive remedies of Parent and
Merger Sub and the Company set forth in Section 8.3; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any willful
breach hereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that, if all conditions set forth in
Article VII have been satisfied, the failure of any party hereto to effect the
Merger, without terminating this Agreement in accordance herewith, shall be
deemed to be a willful breach hereof. The payment of the Expenses and, if and
as due, the Termination Fee by the Company or a termination fee by Parent, in
each case pursuant to Section 8.3, upon a termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1 shall constitute liquidated damages in consideration
of the time and opportunity and related costs of Parent and Merger Sub or the
Company, as applicable, and, upon receipt of such amount(s), if and as due,
except in the case of a willful breach hereof, Parent and Merger Sub shall
have no further recourse at law or in equity against the Company, and the
Company shall have no further recourse at law or in equity against Parent, in
respect of this Agreement or any breach hereof.



8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.



(a) The Company shall pay to Parent its Expenses upon the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to (i) Section 8.1(b)(iii), if prior to the vote of the
Companys stockholders on the Merger an Adverse Recommendation Change has
occurred or the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition
Proposal has been made public, (ii) Section 8.1(c) or (iii) Section 8.1(f).
As used herein, the term " _Expenses_ " shall mean all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses (excluding any wages or salaries of any of
Parents or Merger Subs or any of their affiliates employees) incurred by
Parent and/or Merger Sub prior to the termination of this Agreement in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Expenses shall not exceed $2,500,000. If the
Company is required to pay Parent its Expenses upon termination of this
Agreement, such Expenses shall be payable immediately on or prior, and as a
condition, to the termination of this Agreement in the event of a termination
by the Company and not later than two Business Days after the date of the
termination of this Agreement by Parent.



(b) The Company shall pay Parent a termination fee of $15,000,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ ") upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to (i)
Section 8.1(b)(iii) if an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred
prior to the vote of the Companys stockholders on the Merger, (ii) Section
8.1(c) or (iii) Section 8.1(f). If (x) this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 8.1(b)(iii) and prior to the vote of the Companys stockholders on
the Merger no Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred but the
Company shall have received an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been made public and (y) within 12 months after any such
termination the Company enters into, or announces its intent to enter into, an
Acquisition Proposal with a third party, the Company shall pay Parent
the Termination Fee upon the Companys entry into, or announcement of an
intent to enter into, such Acquisition Proposal. If (A) this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) and prior to such termination, the
Company shall have received an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been made public after the receipt of the Company
Requisite Vote and (B) within 12 months after any such termination the Company
enters into, or announces its intent to 



 

40 enter into, such Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall pay Parent the
Termination Fee upon the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ that the Termination Fee shall not be payable pursuant to this
sentence if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) and at
such time any of the antitrust clearances included in the Company Required
Statutory Approvals or Parent Required Statutory Approvals have not been
obtained or the conditions set forth in Article VII have not been satisfied
due to the failure to obtain such antitrust clearances. If the Company is
required to pay Parent a Termination Fee upon termination of this Agreement,
such Termination Fee shall be payable immediately on or prior, and as a
condition, to the termination of this Agreement in the event of a termination
by the Company and not later than two Business Days after the date of the
termination of this Agreement by Parent. If the Company is required to pay
Parent a Termination Fee pursuant to the second and third sentences of this
Section 8.3(b), such fee shall be payable immediately on or prior, and as a
condition, to the last event triggering such obligation.



(c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) and the
waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the consummation of the Merger
shall not have expired or been earlier terminated on or prior to such date of
termination or any of the antitrust clearances included in the Company
Required Statutory Approvals or Parent Required Statutory Approvals have not
been obtained on or prior to such date of termination, but all other
conditions set forth in Article VII have been satisfied (except to the extent
not satisfied due to the failure to obtain antitrust clearances), then Parent
shall pay the Company a termination fee of $15,000,000. If Parent is required
to pay the Company a termination fee upon termination of this Agreement, such
termination fee shall be payable immediately on or prior, and as a condition,
to the termination of this Agreement in the event of a termination by Parent
and not later than two Business Days after the date of the termination of
this Agreement by the Company.



(d) Any Termination Fee and Expenses required to be paid pursuant to this
Section 8.3 shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated by Parent or as designated by the Company if a fee is
paid pursuant to Section 8.3(c).



(e) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 6.10 and 8.2 and this Section
8.3, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger and any other transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
party incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated hereby is consummated.

the Company Disclosure Schedules and the Parent Disclosure Schedules) and the
Confidentiality



 

43 Agreement, dated July 21, 2005, between Parent and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") constitute the entire agreement by and between
the parties hereto, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings,
representations and warranties, both written and oral, between the parties,
with respect to the subject matter hereof. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT,
EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT,
NEITHER PARENT AND MERGER SUB NOR THE COMPANY MAKES ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS
OR WARRANTIES, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES MADE BY ITSELF, OR ANY OF ITS RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,
EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, FINANCIAL AND LEGAL ADVISORS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, WITH
RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE
OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT
TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING.



9.9 _Binding Effect; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be
binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assignees. Other than with respect to the
matters set forth in Section 6.8 (Indemnification; Directors and Officers
Insurance; Exculpation) and in Article III, this Agreement is not intended to
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto (and their respective
successors and permitted assignees) any rights or remedies hereunder.



9.10 _Obligations of Parent and the Company_. Except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, whenever this Agreement requires Merger Sub to take any
action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part
of Parent to cause Merger Sub to take such action and, after the Effective

Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the
Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.



9.11 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provisions
hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall, subject to Section
9.5, such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other
jurisdiction.



9.12 _Disclosure Schedules_. Any information disclosed in any section of the
Company Disclosure Schedules or the Parent Disclosure Schedules shall
be deemed to be disclosed in any other section(s) of the Company Disclosure
Schedules or the Parent Disclosure Schedules, respectively, where it is
reasonably apparent that the disclosure contained in such section of the
Company Disclosure Schedules or the Parent Disclosure Schedules, as
applicable, is relevant to such other section(s). The Company Disclosure
Schedules and the Parent



 

44 Disclosure Schedules, respectively, and the information and disclosure
contained therein, are intended only to qualify and clarify the
representations, warranties and covenants of the Company or Parent (and Merger
Sub), as the case may be, contained in this Agreement and shall not be deemed
to expand in any way the scope, construction or effect of any of
such representations, warranties or covenants. No reference to or disclosure
of any item or other matter in the Company Disclosure Schedules or the Parent
Disclosure Schedules shall be construed to establish a standard of materiality
or knowledge. 



9.13 _Interpretation_. The table of contents and headings herein are for
convenience of reference only, do not constitute parts of this Agreement and
shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof.
Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section, Article or
Schedule, such reference shall be to a Section or Article of or Schedule to
this Agreement unless otherwise clearly indicated. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." "Dollars" or "$"
shall mean the currency of the United States that, as at the time of payment,
is legal tender for the payment of public and private debts. 



9.14 _Assignment_. This Agreement and the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall not be assignable or delegable without the prior written
consent of the other parties; _provided_ , _however __,_ that Parent may
designate, by written notice to the Company, another wholly owned subsidiary
to be a constituent corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, so long as such
designation could not reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any material delay
in the obtaining of, or significantly increase the risk of not obtaining,
any Parent Required Statutory Approval or Company Required Statutory Approval
or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii)
significantly increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order
prohibiting the consummation of the Merger; (iii) significantly increase the
risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise; or
(iv) materially delay the consummation of the Merger. If the requirements of
the previous sentence are met and Parent desires to designate another wholly
owned subsidiary to be the constituent corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, then
all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other
subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein with
respect to Merger Sub as of the date hereof shall be deemed representations
and warranties made with respect to such other subsidiary as of the date of
such designation.
