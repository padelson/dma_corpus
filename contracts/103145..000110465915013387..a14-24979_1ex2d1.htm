(a) _Estimated Statements_. _Schedule 3.4(a)(i)_ contains a written
statement, together with reasonable supporting documents, reflecting the
Companys good faith estimate of Closing Working Capital (the " ** _Estimated
Closing Working Capital_** ") prepared utilizing the accounting principles,
methods, procedures and practices used to prepare the sample statement for
10/31/2014 included on _Schedule 3.4(a)(ii)_. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall provide its good faith estimate of Closing Cash (the " **
_Estimated Closing Cash_** "). The Estimated Closing Cash and the Estimated
Closing Working Capital shall be binding on the parties hereto for purposes of
determining the Purchase Price.

 



 

(b) _Closing Statements_. As promptly as practicable, but no later than 60
days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to the Seller Representative a statement setting forth the Closing
Cash and Closing Working Capital prepared utilizing the accounting principles,
methods, procedures and practices used to prepare _Schedule 3.4(a)(i)_ and
underlying documentation supporting the Buyers calculation of the Closing
Cash and the Closing Working Capital.

 



 

(c) _Access to Records_. During the 30 day period following delivery of the
statement setting forth the Closing Cash and the Closing Working Capital to
the Seller Representative, the Seller Representative and its advisors shall
have the right to reasonable access to the Companys books and records,
appropriate staff members and such other information as the Seller
Representative shall reasonably request in order to review the Closing Cash
and the Closing Working Capital.

 



 

(d) _Notice of Disagreement_. The statement setting forth the Closing Cash and
the Closing Working Capital delivered by the Buyer to the Seller
Representative shall be conclusive and binding on all parties unless the
Seller Representative, within 30 days after delivery of that statement setting
forth the Closing

 



      
 

 



 

Cash and the Closing Working Capital, delivers a notice to the Buyer stating
that the Seller Representative disagrees with such calculations and specifying
in reasonable detail those items or amounts as to which the Seller
Representative disagrees and the basis therefor.

 



 

(e) _Dispute Resolution_. If a notice of disagreement is duly delivered
pursuant to _Section 3.4(d)_, the Seller Representative and the Buyer shall,
during the 15 days following such delivery, use their commercially reasonable
efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to
determine, as may be required, the amount of the Closing Cash and/or the
Closing Working Capital. If during such period, the Seller Representative and
the Buyer are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter
cause the Independent Accountant to review this Agreement and the disputed
items or amounts for the purpose of calculating the Closing Cash or Closing
Working Capital, as applicable.

 



 

(f) _Independent Accountant s Engagement_. Each party agrees to execute, if
requested by the Independent Accountant, a reasonable engagement letter.

 



 

(g) _Cooperation with Independent Accountant_. The Buyer and the Seller
Representative shall cooperate with the Independent Accountant and promptly
provide all documents and information requested by the Independent Accountant.

 



 

(h) _Independent Accountant s Report_. In making any such calculation(s), the
Independent Accountant shall consider only those items or amounts in the
Closing Cash and Closing Working Capital as to which the Seller Representative
has disagreed in its notice of disagreement duly delivered pursuant to
_Section 3.4(d)_. The Independent Accountant shall deliver to the Seller
Representative and the Buyer, as promptly as practicable (but in any case no
later than 30 days from the date of engagement), a report setting forth such
calculation. Such report shall be final and binding upon the Sellers and the
Buyer, shall be deemed a final arbitration award that is binding on the Buyer
and the Sellers, and neither the Buyer nor any Sellers shall seek further
recourse in courts or other tribunals, other than to enforce such report.

 



 

(i) _Cost of Review_. The Independent Accountant shall determine the
allocation of the cost of its review and report based on the inverse of the
percentage its determination (before such allocation) bears to the total
amount of the items in dispute as originally submitted to Independent
Accountant. For example, should the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000
and the Independent Accountant awards $600 in favor of the Sellers position,
60% of the costs of its review would be borne by the Buyer and 40% of the
costs would be borne by the Sellers.

 



 

(j) _Positive Final Adjustment_. If the Final Adjustment is a positive number,
the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers an amount equal to the Final Adjustment by

 



      
 

 



 

wire transfer of immediately available United States funds within 3 Business
Days of the determination of such Final Adjustment.

 



 

(k) _Negative Final Adjustment_. If the Final Adjustment is a negative number,
the Sellers shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the absolute value of
the Final Adjustment by wire transfer of immediately available United States
funds within 3 Business Days of the determination of such Final Adjustment.

 



 

(l) _Adjustment Escrow_. On the Closing Date, the Buyer shall pay to the
Escrow Agent, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to $1,000,000
(the " ** _Adjustment Escrow Amount_** "), in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Any payment the Sellers are obligated
to make to the Company pursuant to _Section 3.4(k)_ shall: (i) first be paid
by release of funds to the Company from the Adjustment Escrow Amount by the
Escrow Agent within 5 Business Days after the date of notice of any sums due
and owing is given to the Seller Representative (with a copy to the Escrow
Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement) by the Buyer and shall accordingly
reduce the Adjustment Escrow Amount; and (ii) second, to the extent the
Adjustment Escrow Amount is insufficient to pay any remaining sums due, then,
in the Companys sole discretion, either (A) any remaining sums due shall be
paid from the Indemnity Escrow Amount; or (B) the Sellers shall, severally and
not jointly, be required to pay their respective Pro-rata Portion of any
remaining sums due to the Company by wire transfer of immediately available
funds within 5 Business Days after the date of such determination.

 



 

(m) _Release of Escrow_. Within 5 days following: (i) the payment of the Final
Adjustment; or (ii) a final determination of the Closing Cash and Closing
Working Capital pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ determining that no Final
Adjustment shall be paid, the Escrow Agent shall release the Adjustment Escrow
Amount (to the extent not utilized to pay the Company for any Final
Adjustment) to the Sellers.

 



 

(n) _Conflict Waiver_. The Buyer acknowledges and waives any actual or
potential conflict of Company staff members assisting the Seller
Representative and its advisors as described in this _Section 3.4_ and shall
not, and shall cause the Company to not, prevent such access by the Seller
Representative.

 



 

3.5 _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 



 

(a) _Tax Allocation among Purchased Securities_. For all U.S. federal income
tax purposes, the Sellers and the Buyer agree (a) to allocate the Purchase
Price to the Blocker Corp Shares of each Blocker Corp based on the Purchase
Price payable to each Blocker Corp Seller as set forth on _Schedule 3.1_ , and
to allocate the excess of the Purchase Price over the amount allocated to the
Blocker Corp Shares to the Company Units and (b) to treat any liabilities of
the Company and all other items

 



      
 

 



 

properly includible in the amount realized by the Sellers on the sale of the
Purchased Securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Final
Adjustment and any payments pursuant to any indemnification obligation, as an
adjustment to the purchase price of the Purchased Securities to which the
liability, Final Adjustment or indemnification payment relates.

 



 

(b) _Tax Allocation of Purchase Price among Certain Company Assets_. The
parties agree to negotiate in good faith after the Closing to agree on the
identity and the fair market value of the Companys assets that are described
in Section 751(a) of the Code. No later than ninety (90) days after the
Closing the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Seller Representative an
allocation schedule (the " ** _Allocation Schedule_** ") that allocates among
all of the Companys assets (in reasonable detail) the portion of the purchase
price of the Company Units (consistent with _Section 3.5(a)_ and otherwise as
determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that the Buyer has reasonably
determined is allocable to the assets of the Company. If the Seller
Representative disagrees with the Buyers Allocation Schedule, the Seller
Representative may, within thirty (30) days after the Buyers delivery of such
statement, deliver a notice to the Seller Representative of disagreement with
the Allocation Schedule, which shall identify the items with which the Seller
Representative disagrees and the Seller Representatives proposed revisions to
such schedule. The Seller Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with
all other items and amounts contained in the Allocation Schedule. If the
Seller Representative fails to object in writing to the allocation set forth
in the Allocation Schedule within the thirty (30) day period following Buyers
delivery of such schedule, the parties will be deemed conclusively to have
agreed to the Buyers Allocation Schedule, and such schedule shall be final
and binding upon parties and their respective Affiliates. If a notice a
disagreement is delivered to the Buyer, either party may request that the
disagreements be resolved by an independent accounting firm mutually
acceptable to the parties. If submitted for resolution by such accounting
firm, the Seller Representative and Buyer shall promptly direct the such firm
to make a final determination of the items included in the Allocation Schedule
that are in dispute, and the parties shall be bound by such resolution. The
costs of the accounting firms determination will be borne by the party
requesting that such determination be made. For all income Tax purposes
(including but not limited to the filing of Tax Returns) the Sellers and the
Buyer shall be bound by the Allocation Schedule as finally agreed or
determined under this _Section 3.5(b)_ (as modified from time to time to
reflect any subsequent adjustment to the Purchase Price).

 



 

3.6 _Deferred Payment Seller_.

 



 

(a) At the Closing, Buyer will reduce the Purchase Price otherwise payable
pursuant to _Section 3.1_ to Herman Itzkowitz (the " ** _Deferred Payment
Employee_** ") in respect of his Purchased Securities by an amount equal to
one million dollars ($1,000,000) (the " ** _Deferred Payment Amount_** "), and
will issue in lieu of the

 



       
 

 



 

Deferred Payment Amount a purchase money note (the " ** _Deferred Payment
Note_** ") in the form attached hereto as _EXHIBIT C_. If the Deferred
Payment Employee remains an employee with Buyer, an Affiliate of Buyer, or an
entity to which Buyer assigns or transfers the Deferred Payment Employees
employment (as applicable, a " ** _Buyer Employer_** ") at all times between
the Closing Date and the first anniversary thereof, then pursuant to the
Deferred Payment Note one-half (1/2) of the Deferred Payment Amount will be
paid to the Deferred Payment Employee within ten (10) Business Days following
such first anniversary date (plus accrued interest). If the Deferred Payment
Employee remains an employee with a Buyer Employer at all times between the
Closing Date and the second anniversary thereof, then pursuant to the Deferred
Payment Note the remaining one-half (1/2) of the Deferred Payment Amount (plus
accrued interest) will be paid to the Deferred Payment Employee within ten
(10) Business Days following such second anniversary date. In the event the
Deferred Payment Employee ceases to be an employee of a Buyer Employer for any
reason at any time prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, then
the Deferred Payment Employee will forfeit the Deferred Payment Note and any
portion of the Deferred Payment Amount not yet paid to the Deferred Payment
Employee.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Deferred Payment Employee ceases to
be an employee with a Buyer Employer prior to the second anniversary of the
Closing Date due to the Deferred Payment Employees employment being
terminated by such Buyer Employer without Cause (as defined below), then
pursuant to the Deferred Payment Note the entire portion of the Deferred
Payment Amount that has not been paid to the Deferred Payment Employee prior
to such termination will be paid to the Deferred Payment Employee, provided
that within sixty (60) days after such termination the Deferred Payment
Employee (i) executes and delivers to Buyer a release of claims in the form
then used by Buyer for standard employee releases (such form, the " **
_Release_** ") and (ii) lets such release become irrevocable, in which case
such payment will be made within fourteen (14) days after the date on which
the Release becomes irrevocable. To the extent that the Deferred Payment
Amount is subject to Section 409A of the Code and the Deferred Payment
Employee is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code,
such payment will be deferred until the earliest of (A) the expiration of the
six (6) month period measured from the date of the Deferred Payment Employees
termination of employment, (B) the date of the Deferred Payment Employees
death following such termination of employment, and (C) the earliest date that
such payment could be made without subjecting the payment to the additional
tax and interest imposed by Section 409A of the Code; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such deferral will only be effected to the extent required to avoid
adverse tax treatment to the Deferred Payment Employee. Upon expiration of the
applicable deferral period, any payments which would otherwise have been made
during that period will be paid to the Deferred Payment Employee (or the
Deferred Payment Employees estate, in the case of a termination by reason of
death) in one lump sum. For purposes of the Deferred Payment Note, termination
of the Deferred Payment Employees employment will be deemed to have occurred
only if such

 



      
 

 



 

termination is a "separation from service" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation1.409A-1(h). Additionally, for purposes of the Deferred Payment
Note, " ** _Cause_** " means, with respect to the termination of the Deferred
Payment Employees employment by a Buyer Employer, that such termination is
for "Cause" as such term (or word of like import) is expressly defined in a
then-effective written agreement between the Deferred Payment Employee and
such Buyer Employer, or in the absence of such then-effective written
agreement and definition, is based on, in the determination of such Buyer
Employer, the Deferred Payment Employees: (A) performance of any act or
failure to perform any act in bad faith and to the detriment of such Buyer
Employer or an Affiliate of such Buyer Employer; (B) dishonesty, intentional
misconduct or material breach of any agreement with such Buyer Employer or an
Affiliate of such Buyer Employer; or (C) commission of a crime involving
dishonesty, breach of trust, or physical or emotional harm to any Person.

 



 

(c) For all Tax purposes, the Buyer agrees (i) that it shall report (or cause
to be reported) all payments made under this _Section 3.6_ as Buyer reports
(or causes to be reported) all other payments described in _Section 3.1_ of
this Agreement and consideration paid pursuant to _Section 3.1_ for Company
Units and (ii) the payments made under this _Section 3.6_ shall be made
without deduction or withholding of Tax.

guarantee with respect to the obligations of, any Person. There are no
outstanding stock appreciation, phantom stock, profit participation or similar

8.4 _Regulatory Approvals_.

 



 

(a) _Effect; Filings; Approvals; Authorizations_. Each of the parties agrees
to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
to file, or

 



       
 

 



 

cause to be filed, all documents and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transaction, including
preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect
all necessary filings, consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations, permits
or orders from all Governmental Bodies. In furtherance and not in limitation
of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees: (i) to the extent not completed

other parties the opportunity to attend and participate.

 



 

(c) _Efforts; Divestitures_. If any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) to prohibit the
Transaction contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to avoid the institution of any such action or proceeding
and to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any temporary, preliminary or permanent decree,
judgment, injunction or other order that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents, delays or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby (it being understood that the foregoing obligation of Buyer will cease
in the event a permanent decree, judgment, injunction or other order is issued
or is

 



      
 

 



 

in effect that is non-appealable and prohibits consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties hereby agree and
acknowledge that neither this _Section 8.4_ nor the "reasonable best efforts"
standard shall require, or be construed to require, other than as set forth in

Affiliates to (i)(A) sell, lease, license, transfer, dispose of, divest or
otherwise encumber, or hold separate pending any such action, or (B) propose,

the Company (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates), or
(ii) take or agree to take any other action or agree or consent to any
limitations or restrictions on freedom of actions with respect to, or its
ability to retain, or make changes in, any such assets, licenses, operations,

(or any of their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer can compel the Company to take any of the actions
referred to above (or agree to take such actions) if such actions are only
effective after the Closing Date.

 



 

8.5 _Further Assurances_. Subject to, and not in limitation of, _Section
8.4_, each of the Buyer, the Sellers and the Company shall use (and the
Company shall cause each of the Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best

information and communications to such Governmental Bodies or other public or
private Persons as the other Party or such Governmental Bodies or other public
or private Persons may reasonably request in connection therewith; and (c)
execute such further documents, deeds, bills of sale, assignments and
assurances and take such further actions as may reasonably be required to
consummate and make effective the Transaction, including, without limitation,

shall in no way restrict any Seller or any directors, officers, employees or
controlled Affiliates thereof from soliciting for employment any Person
through means of a general advertisement for employment in a newspaper of
general circulation or by other similar means.

 



 

(ii) _Confidentiality_. From and after the date hereof, the Sellers shall not
and shall cause their directors, officers, employees and Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate to any Person
other than authorized officers, directors and employees of the Buyer or the
Company or use or otherwise exploit for its own benefit or for the benefit of
anyone other than the Buyer or the Company, any Confidential Information (as
defined below). The Sellers shall not have any obligation to keep confidential
(or cause its officers, directors or Affiliates to keep confidential) any
Confidential Information if and to the extent disclosure thereof is
specifically required by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event disclosure is required by applicable Law, the Sellers shall, to the
extent reasonably possible, provide the Buyer with prompt notice of such
requirement prior to making any disclosure so that the Buyer may seek an
appropriate protective order. This obligation of confidentiality shall not
apply to any exercise of the Sellers rights hereunder or in any dispute with
the Buyer with respect to this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the
Transaction.

 



 

8.7 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) _Indemnitees_. For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, the

permitted under applicable Law, the Persons who on or prior to the Closing
Date were managers, directors, officers, employees of the Company, the Blocker
Corps or any of the Subsidiaries (collectively, the " ** _Indemnitees_** ")
with respect to all acts or omissions by them or taken at the request of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries. The Company, the Blocker Corps and the
Buyer agree that all rights of the Indemnitees to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Closing Date as provided in the respective certificate of formation or
limited liability company agreement or comparable organizational documents of
the Company, the Blocker Corps or any of the Subsidiaries as now in effect,
and any indemnification agreements or arrangements of the Company, the Blocker
Corps or any of the Subsidiaries shall survive the Closing Date and shall
continue in full force and effect in

 



      
 

 



 

accordance with their terms. Such rights shall not be amended, or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the
Indemnitees, unless such modification is required by Law. In addition, the
Company shall pay any expenses of any Indemnitee under this _Section 8.7_, as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, _provided_ that
the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances to the extent required by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) _Indemnitors_. The Company, the Blocker Corps and the Buyer hereby
acknowledges that certain Indemnitees may have rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by Affiliates of Summit
Partners L.P. (other than the Company and the Subsidiaries) (collectively, the
" ** _Secondary Indemnitors_** "). The Company hereby agrees: (i) that it is
the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to the Indemnitees are
primary and any obligation of the Secondary Indemnitors to advance expenses or
to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by
the Indemnitees are secondary); (ii) that it shall be required to advance the
full amount of expenses incurred by any Indemnitee and shall be liable for the
full amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in
settlement to the extent legally permitted and as required by the terms of
this Agreement and certificate of incorporation, certificate of formation, by-
laws, limited partnership agreement or limited liability company agreement or
comparable organizational documents of the Company and each of the
Subsidiaries (or any other agreement between the Company or any Subsidiaries
and any such Indemnitee), without regard to any rights the Indemnitee may have
against the Secondary Indemnitors; and (iii) that it irrevocably waives,
relinquishes and releases the Secondary Indemnitors from any and all claims
against the Secondary Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any other
recovery of any kind in respect thereof. The Company, the Blocker Corps and
the Buyer further agrees that no advancement or payment by the Secondary
Indemnitors on behalf of any Indemnitee with respect to any claim for which
such Indemnitee has sought indemnification from the Company shall affect the
foregoing and the Secondary Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution
and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of
the rights of recovery of the Indemnitee against the Company or any
Subsidiary. The Company, the Buyer and the Indemnitees agree that the
Secondary Indemnitors are express third party beneficiaries of the terms of
this _Section 8.7(b)_.

Closing Date, the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Blocker Corps shall
maintain in effect the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Blocker Corps
immediately prior to the Closing Date ( _provided_ that a "run-off" or "tail"
policy for a period of 6 years with a reputable and financially sound carrier
of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that
are no less advantageous may substituted therefore) with respect to claims
arising from or related to facts or events that occurred at or before the
Closing

 



      
 

 



 

Date _provided, however_ , that, if the annual premium for such insurance
shall exceed 250% of the current annual premium (such 250% threshold, the " **
_Maximum Premium_** "), then Buyer shall provide or cause to be provided a
policy with the best coverage as shall be available at an annual premium not
in excess of the Maximum Premium.

 



 

(d) _No Substitution of Rights_. The provisions of this _Section 8.7_: (i)
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her representatives; and (ii) are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such person may have by Contract or otherwise.

 



 

(e) _Successor Obligation_. In the event that the Company, any Blocker Corp,
any Subsidiary or any of their respective successors or assigns: (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Company or the Subsidiary, as
applicable, shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this
_Section 8.7_.

 



 

(f) _Consent_. The obligations of the Company under this _Section 8.7_ shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnitee to whom this _Section 8.7_ applies without the consent of the
affected Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom
this _Section 8.7_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 8.7_).

in the sole judgment of the Company, the Buyer or the Seller, as applicable,
disclosure is otherwise required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules
of any stock exchange on which the Company, the Buyer or the Seller lists

party intending to make such release shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts consistent with such applicable Law to consult with the other party
with respect to the timing and content thereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the Sellers and the Buyer are permitted to report and disclose the terms and

limited partners and on their websites and otherwise in the ordinary course of
their business after the Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Confidentiality of the Agreement_. Each of the Buyer, the Sellers and the
Company agree that the terms of this Agreement shall not be disclosed or
otherwise made available to the public and that copies of this Agreement shall
not be publicly filed or otherwise made available to the public, except where
such disclosure, availability or filing is required by applicable Law and only
to the extent required by such Law. In the event that such disclosure,
availability or filing is required by applicable Law, each of the Buyer, the
Sellers and the Company (as applicable) agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain "confidential treatment" of this Agreement with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (or the equivalent treatment by
any other Governmental Body) and to redact such terms of this Agreement as the
other party shall request.

the Company, its business or assets to any Person or otherwise), initiate or
participate in any negotiations or discussions, or enter into, accept or
authorize any agreement or agreement in principle, or announce any intention
to do any of the foregoing, with respect to any expression of interest, offer,

proposal or offer relating to a possible Competing Transaction that is,
directly or indirectly, received by the Company or the Sellers, which notice
shall contain the nature of the proposal proposed and the material terms of
the proposal and include copies of any such notice, inquiry or proposal.

 



 

8.10 _Disclosure Schedule_.

 



 

(a) _Inclusion of Non-Material Items_. The Company and the Sellers may, at
their discretion, include in the Disclosure Schedule items that are not
material in order to avoid any misunderstanding, and such inclusion, or any
references to dollar amounts, shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgement or
representation that such

 



      
 

 



 

items are material, to establish any standard of materiality or to define
further the meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Disclosure For All Purposes_. Information disclosed in the Disclosure

individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder), as determined immediately prior to the
initiation of the stockholder solicitation required by this _Section
8.13(a)_, and who reasonably might otherwise receive, have received, or have
the right or entitlement to receive an excess parachute payment under Section

of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code (the " ** _280G Proposal_** ") so that
such vote, if obtained, will render the parachute payment provisions of
Section 280G and Section 4999 of the Code inapplicable to any and all payments
and/or benefits provided pursuant to Contracts or arrangements that, in the
absence of the executed Parachute Payment Waivers by the affected Persons
under _Section 8.13_ might otherwise reasonably result, separately or in the
aggregate, in the payment of any amount and/or the provision of any benefit
that would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or subject
to an excise tax by reason of Section 4999 of the Code, with such stockholder
approval to be solicited in a manner which satisfies all applicable
requirements of such Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder, including Q-7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such Treasury
Regulations. The documentation constituting the 280G Proposal shall be
subject to the Buyers prior review and approval, which shall not be

the Sellers_. The obligations of the Company, the Blocker Corps and the
Sellers to consummate the Transaction are subject to the fulfillment, prior to
or on the Closing Date, of each of the following conditions (any or all of
which may be waived by the Company in whole or in part to the extent permitted
by applicable Law):

 



 

(a) _Accuracy of Representations and Warranties_. (i) The representations and
warranties related to the Buyer set forth in _Article VII_ that are qualified
by reference to materiality shall be true and correct in all respects; and
(ii) the representations and warranties related to the Buyer set forth in
_Article VII_ that are not so qualified shall be true and correct in all
material respects (except the representations and warranties of _Section 7.1_
(Organization and Good Standing), _Section 7.2_ (Authorization of Agreement)
and _Section 7.5_ (Financial Advisors) which shall be true and correct in all
respects), in each of cases (i) and (ii), as of the Closing Date as if made on
and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent that any such representation
or warranty, by its terms, is expressly limited to a specific date, in which
case, as of such specific date), and the Company shall have received a
certificate signed by an authorized officer of the Buyer, dated the Closing
Date, to the foregoing effect.

 



 

(b) _Performance of Obligations_. The Buyer shall have performed and complied
in all material respects with all obligations and agreements required by this
Agreement to be performed or complied with by the Buyer on or prior to the
Closing Date, and the Company shall have received a certificate signed by an
authorized officer of the Buyer, dated the Closing Date, to the foregoing
effect.

 



 

(c) _No Prohibition of Transaction_. There shall not be in effect any Order by
a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Transaction.

under the HSR Act shall have expired or early termination shall have been
granted.

 



 

(e) _Escrow Agreement_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Buyer shall have
delivered to the Sellers, the Escrow Agreement, duly executed by the Buyer.

 



 

If the Closing occurs, all closing conditions set forth in this _Section 9.2_
which have not been fully satisfied as of the Closing shall be deemed to have
been fully waived; provided, however, that such waiver shall not be deemed to
cure any breach of representations, warranties or covenants, for purposes of
determining any partys obligations under _Article X_ hereto.

 



 

9.3 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. None of the Company, the Blocker
Corps, the Buyer or the Sellers may rely on the failure of any condition set
forth in _Sections 9.1_ or _9.2_ , as the case may be, if such failure was
primarily caused by such partys failure to comply with any provision of this
Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE X**

 



 

 **INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

10.1 _Indemnification of the Buyer_.

 



 

(a) _Selling Party Breaches; Pre-Closing Taxes_. After the Closing Date and
pursuant to the provisions and limitations set forth in this _Article X_:

 



 

(i) _Company Indemnification_ : each of the Sellers shall, severally and not
jointly, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer and its Affiliates and
their respective officers, directors, agents, employees, managers, partners,
stockholders, attorneys, representatives, successors and assigns (each
hereinafter referred to individually as a " ** _Buyer Indemnified Person_** "
and collectively as " ** _Buyer Indemnified Persons_** "), from and against,
such Sellers Pro-rata Portion of any and all claims, actions, losses, costs,
damages, Liabilities, deficiencies, demands, judgments, interest, fines,
penalties, suits, causes of action, assessments, awards, and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees, costs of investigation or settlement,
other professionals and experts fees, and court or arbitration costs
(hereinafter collectively referred to as " ** _Damages_** ") based upon,
attributable to or resulting from: (A) the failure of any of the
representations or warranties made by the Company in _Article IV_ hereof or
any Company Document to be true and correct in all respects at and as of the
date hereof and the Closing Date; or (B) the breach of any covenant contained
herein or other agreement that, by its terms, relates to conduct prior to the
Closing Date on the part of the Company (the " ** _Company Breaches_** ");

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) _Blocker Corp Indemnification_ : each of the Blocker Corp Sellers shall,
severally and not jointly, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnified Persons from and against any and all Damages based upon,
attributable to or resulting, directly or indirectly, from: (A) the failure of

such Blocker Corp Seller in _Article V_ hereof or any Blocker Corp Document
to be true and correct in all respect at and as of the date hereof and the
Closing Date; (B) the breach of any covenant contained herein or other

Liabilities of the Blocker Corps arising out of the activities of the Blocker
Corps on or before the Closing Date (the " ** _Blocker Corp Breaches_** ");
and

 



 

(iii) _Seller Indemnification_ : each of the Sellers shall, severally and not
jointly, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Persons
from and against any and all Damages based upon, attributable to or resulting,
directly or indirectly from: (A) the failure of any of the representations or

Documents to be true and correct in all respects at and as of the date hereof
and the Closing Date; or (B) the breach of any covenant contained herein or
other agreement on the part of such Seller (the " ** _Individual Seller
Breaches_** " and, together with Company Breaches and Blocker Corp Breaches, "
** _Selling Party Breaches_** ").

 



 

The right to indemnification or any other remedy based on representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement, or any Seller
Documents, Company Documents or Blocker Corp Documents, shall not be affected
by any investigation conducted at any time, or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, with respect to the accuracy or
inaccuracy of, or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement. For purposes of calculating the amount of Damages hereunder, any
materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifications in the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements shall be disregarded.

 



 

(b) _Tax Indemnity_.

 



 

(i) _Company Taxes_. Without duplication of any other indemnification rights
under this Agreement, each of the Sellers shall, severally and not jointly,
indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Persons from and against any
and all Damages attributable to (1) any and all Pre-Closing Taxes of the
Company and the Subsidiaries to the extent such Pre-Closing Taxes are not
taken into account as a Current Liability in the computation of Closing
Working Capital or Closing Cash, (2) all Taxes required to be paid by the
Company or any Subsidiary after the Closing by reason of the Company or any
Subsidiary (or a predecessor of such entities) having been a member of an
affiliated, consolidated,

 



      
 

 



 

combined, or unitary group on or prior to the Closing, including pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local,
or foreign law, rule, or regulation, and (3) any and all Taxes of any Person
(other than the Company and the Subsidiaries) required to be paid by the
Company or any Subsidiary by contract or pursuant to law, rule, or regulation,
or as a transferee or successor if the status of the Company or Subsidiary as
transferee or successor is attributable to an event or transaction occurring
before the Closing.

 



 

(ii) _Blocker Corp Taxes_. Without duplication of any other indemnification
rights under this Agreement, each of the Blocker Corp Sellers shall, severally
and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Persons
from and against any and all Damages attributable to (1) Pre-Closing Taxes of
the Blocker Corp sold by the Blocker Corp Seller to the extent that such Pre-
Closing Taxes are not taken into account as a Current Liability in the
computation of Closing Working Capital, (2) all Taxes required to be paid by
such Blocker Corp after the Closing by reason of such Blocker Corp having been
a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined, or unitary group prior to
the Closing, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any
analogous or similar state, local, or foreign law, rule, or regulation, and
(3) any and all Taxes of any Person (other than such Blocker Corp, but
including its Blocker LP) required to be paid by such Blocker Corp by contract
or pursuant to law, rule, or regulation or as a transferee or successor if the
status of such Blocker Corp as a transferee or successor is attributable to an
event or transaction occurring before the Closing, or pursuant to this
Agreement (including the liquidation of its Blocker LP).

 



 

(iii) _Straddle Period Allocation_. The parties shall, unless prohibited by
applicable Law, treat each current taxable period of the Company, the
Subsidiaries, and each Blocker Corp as ending at the close of business on the
Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, Taxes incurred by such entity
with respect to a Straddle Period shall be allocated to the portion of the
period ending on the Closing Date (A) except as provided in (B) below, with
respect to periodically assessed Taxes (such as personal and real property
Taxes) in proportion to the number of days in such period occurring before the
Closing Date compared to the total number of days in such period, and (B) in
the case of any Tax based on income or receipts or a specific transaction or
event, in an amount equal to the Tax which would be payable if the taxable
period of such entity beginning before and ending after the Closing Date had
ended at the close of business on the Closing Date; provided that exemptions,
allowances and deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including,
but not limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be
allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period after
the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each such period. For
the elimination of doubt, any

 



      
 

 



 

transfer Taxes imposed on such entity attributable to the Transaction shall be
allocated to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date.

 



 

(iv) _Closing Date Transactions_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Sellers shall have no indemnification obligation pursuant to
this _Section 10.1(b)_ for Taxes attributable to transactions undertaken
without the written approval of the Seller Representative after the Closing on
the Closing Date that are outside of the Ordinary Course of Business or the
ordinary course of business of the Blocker Corps, except by reason of
consummation of the Transaction.

 



 

(c) _Deductible_. The indemnification provided for in this _Section 10.1(a)_
shall not apply and the Sellers shall not have any obligations or liability
related to or arising from this Agreement or the Transaction (whether in
contract, tort or otherwise) related to Selling Party Breaches, unless and
until the aggregate Damages arising out of Selling Party Breaches exceeds a
cumulative aggregate of $1,000,000 (the " ** _Deductible_** "), in which event
the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall, subject to the other limitations herein,
be indemnified for only such Damages in excess of the Deductible; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Deductible shall not apply to limit the indemnification
obligations of the Sellers for breaches of the Fundamental Representations or
the covenant of Sellers to indemnify the Buyer for Taxes under _Section
10.1(b)_ (the " ** _Tax Indemnity_** "), Income Tax Preparation Expenses under
_Section 12.1(d)(ii)_ or Transaction Expenses under _Section 12.2_ or to
Fraud Claims.

 



 

(d) _Cap_. The aggregate liability of the Sellers pursuant to _Sections
10.1(a)(i)_ , _10.1(a)(ii)(A)_ , and _10.1(a)(iii)(A)_ shall be limited to
$5,000,000 (the " ** _Cap_** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to
Damages related to Selling Party Breaches of the Fundamental Representations,
the Tax Indemnity or Fraud Claims, (i) the Cap shall not apply; and (ii) such
Damages shall not be included in any calculation of the aggregate amount of
Damages for purposes of determining whether or not the Cap has been exceeded.
The aggregate liability of each Seller pursuant to this _Section 10.1_ or
otherwise related to or arising from this Agreement or the Transaction
(whether in contract, tort or otherwise) shall be limited to the proceeds
received by the applicable Seller under this Agreement (the " ** _Fundamental
Representation Cap_** ").

 



 

(e) _Indemnification Net of Other Recoveries_. The amount with respect to
indemnification payable to an Indemnified Party under this _Article X_ in
respect of Damages shall be determined after taking into account any Tax
Benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party (or, if the Indemnified
Party is a pass-through entity, its direct or indirect owners) by reason of
the incurrence of the Damages or any recovery (whether by way of payment,
discount, credit, off-set, counterclaim or otherwise) received from a third
party (including any insurer) with respect to such Damages, less any cost
(other than any Tax cost) associated with receiving such recovery in respect
of such Damages.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Recovery Under Insurance or Warranties_.

 



 

(i) _Recovery_. To the extent that insurance, "pass-through" warranty coverage
from a manufacturer or other form of recovery or reimbursement from a third
party (including, without limitation, any representation or warranty made by a
Person other than the Company and the Subsidiaries in connection with the
Companys or a Subsidiarys acquisition of an asset or assumption of a
liability and which is not unreasonably burdensome for a Buyer Indemnified
Party to pursue) is available to any Buyer Indemnified Person to cover any
item for which indemnification may be sought hereunder, the Buyer shall, or
shall cause the Buyer Indemnified Person to, on a timely and expeditious
basis, use commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to effect recovery under
applicable insurance policies and warranties and otherwise pursue to
conclusion available remedies or causes of action to recover the amount of its
claim as may be available from such other party; _provided_ the availability
of a potential recovery against such a third party shall not affect the
Buyers right to make a claim pursuant to this _Section 10.1_.

 



 

(ii) _Reduction in Recovery for Premium Increases_. The amount that may be
recovered hereunder by an Indemnified Party shall be reduced by an amount
equal to any recovery referred to in clause (i) above that is actually
received by the Indemnified Party (except to the extent of any repayment or
increase in past, present or future insurance premiums or other similar
repayment mechanisms payable following the date of the claim giving rise to
such increase, determined on a present value basis).

 



 

(g) _Assignment of Claim_. To the extent a Buyer Indemnified Person is
indemnified and paid the full amount of any claim referred to in _Section
10.1(f)_ by the Sellers or from the Indemnity Escrow Amount, the Buyer shall
assign, and the Buyer shall cause the Buyer Indemnified Person to assign, to
the Seller or Sellers, to the fullest extent allowable its claim against such
insurance, warranty coverage or third-party claim.

 



 

(h) _No Contribution_. The Sellers shall have no right of contribution or
other recourse against the Company, the Blocker Corps or the Subsidiaries or
their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys,
representatives, assigns or successors for any Third Party Claims asserted by
a Buyer Indemnified Person, it being acknowledged and agreed that the
covenants and agreements of the Company and the Blocker Corp Sellers in this
Agreement are solely for the benefit of the Buyer Indemnified Persons.

 



 

(i) _Access to Records_. The Seller Representative shall have the right, at
mutually agreeable times during normal business hours, after reasonable notice
to the Buyer and without undue disruption to their normal business activities,
to inspect the

 



      
 

 



 

assets and properties of the Buyer and the Company and to inspect and make
abstracts and reproductions of all books and records of the Buyer and the
Company reasonably required with respect to any such claims. The Buyer shall,
and shall cause the Company to furnish the Seller Representative with such
information respecting the assets, business and financial records of the Buyer
and the Company relating to any such claims as the Seller Representative may,
from time to time, reasonably request and at the sole cost and expense of the
Sellers.

 



 

10.2 _Notice of Indemnification Claim_.

 



 

(a) _Notice Requirements_. As used herein, the term " ** _Indemnification
Claim_** " means a claim for indemnification by the Buyer or any other Buyer
Indemnified Person or any Company Indemnified Person, as the case may be, for
Damages related to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transaction (such
Person making an Indemnification Claim, an " ** _Indemnified Party_** "). An
Indemnified Party shall give notice of an Indemnification Claim under this
Agreement, whether for its own Damages or for Damages incurred by any other
Buyer Indemnified Person or Company Indemnified Person, as applicable,
pursuant to written notice of such Indemnification Claim executed by an
officer of the Buyer or the Seller, as applicable (a " ** _Notice of Claim_**
"), and delivered to the Seller or the Buyer, as applicable (such receiving
party, the " ** _Indemnifying Party_** "), promptly after such Indemnified
Party becomes aware of the existence of any potential claim by such
Indemnified Party for indemnification under this _Article X_, but in any
event before the Expiration Date, arising out of or resulting from:

 



 

(i) Any item indemnified pursuant to the terms of _Section 10.1_; or

 



 

(ii) The assertion, whether orally or in writing, against any Indemnified
Party of a Legal Proceeding, arbitration, investigation, inquiry or proceeding
brought by a third party against any Indemnified Party that arises out of or
results from any item indemnified pursuant to the terms of _Section 10.1_ (in
each such case, a " ** _Third-Party Claim_** ").

 



 

(b) _Effect of Delay_. So long as such Notice of Claim is given on or prior to
the Expiration Date, no delay on the part of an Indemnified Party in giving
the Indemnifying Party a Notice of Claim shall limit or reduce the Indemnified
Partys right to indemnity hereunder, nor relieve the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under this _Article X_, unless (and then only to the
extent that) the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby.

 



 

10.3 _Defense of Third-Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) _Right to Defend_. The Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party
prompt written notice of any Third-Party Claim, provided, that, so long as
such notice is given on or prior to the Expiration Date, no delay on the part
of an

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Party in giving the Indemnifying Party such notice shall limit or
reduce the Indemnified Partys right to indemnity hereunder, nor relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article X, unless
(and then only to the extent that) the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced
thereby. Subject to the provisions hereof:

 



 

(i) _Buyer s Right to Defend_. The Buyer shall have the exclusive right to
defend any Third-Party Claim to which the Deductible is applicable that the
Buyer reasonably believes, in good faith, will not give rise to liability for
Damages that, when taken together with all previously-claimed Damages arising
out of Selling Party Breaches, exceed the Deductible, provided, that if the
Damages arising out of such Third-Party Claim to which the Deductible is
applicable defended by the Buyer exceed the Deductible, the Sellers shall have
no liability with respect thereto (other than the applicable reduction in the
amount of the Deductible); and

 



 

(ii) _Sellers  Right to Defend_. With respect to all other Third-Party Claims
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, all claims arising out of breaches of
the Fundamental Representations), the Indemnifying Party on behalf of the
Indemnified Party shall have the exclusive right to elect to defend any Third-
Party Claim utilizing legal counsel of its choice and the Indemnified Party
may participate in the defense thereof (at its own expense, except to the
extent specifically provided below); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with
separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if: (i) so requested
by the Indemnifying Party to participate; or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of
counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict exists between the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate representation
advisable; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not
be required to pay for more than one such counsel for all Indemnified Parties
in connection with any Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)
the Indemnifying Party may only elect to defend a Third-Party Claim if the
Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify the Indemnified Party pursuant to the
terms hereof for any Damages relating to such Third-Party Claim, subject to
the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) the Buyer shall have the exclusive right
to defend Third-Party Claims with respect to Taxes; provided that no Third-
Party Claim with respect to Taxes may be settled or compromised without the
consent of both the Indemnified and Indemnifying Party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 



 

(b) _Access to Information_. If the Indemnifying Party has the right to and
does elect to defend any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall: (i)
conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim actively and diligently and keep
the Indemnified Party fully informed of material developments in the Third-
Party Claim at all stages thereof; (ii) promptly submit to the Indemnified
Party copies of all pleadings, responsive

 



      
 

 



 

pleadings, motions and other similar legal documents and papers received or
filed in connection therewith; (iii) permit the Indemnified Party and its
counsel to confer on the conduct of the defense thereof; and (iv) permit the
Indemnified Party and its counsel an opportunity to review all legal papers to
be submitted prior to their submission. The Buyer shall make available to the
Seller and its counsel and accountants, without charge, all of its or their
books and records reasonably required in the defense of the Third-Party Claim,
and each party shall render to the other party such assistance as may be
reasonably required in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense thereof
and shall furnish such records, information and testimony and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be
reasonably requested by the other party in connection therewith.

 



 

(c) _Settlement Rights_. If the Indemnifying Party has the right to and does
elect to defend any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to enter into any settlement of a Third-Party Claim without the prior
consent of the Indemnified Party if: (i) the amount of such settlement will be
satisfied solely by the Indemnifying Party ( _provided_ , for the avoidance of
doubt, that no such amounts may be offset against the Deductible); (ii) such
settlement does not involve any injunctive or other equitable relief binding
upon the Buyer, the Company or any of its Affiliates; and (iii) such
settlement expressly and unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party from
all Liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim, without prejudice.
The prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably
withheld) shall be required for any other settlement. If a settlement offer
solely for money damages is made by the applicable third-party claimant, and
the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing of the
Indemnifying Partys willingness to accept the settlement offer and, subject
to the applicable limitations of _Sections 10.1(c)_ \- _(f)_ , pay the amount
called for by such offer, and the Indemnified Party declines to accept such
offer, the Indemnified Party may continue to contest such Third-Party Claim,
free of any participation by the Indemnifying Party, and the amount of any
ultimate liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim that the
Indemnifying Party has an obligation to pay hereunder shall be limited to the
lesser of: (A) the amount of the settlement offer that the Indemnified Party
declined to accept plus the Damages of the Indemnified Party relating to such
Third-Party Claim through the date of its rejection of the settlement offer;
or (B) the aggregate Damages of the Indemnified Party with respect to such
Third-Party Claim.

 



 

10.4 _Contents of Notice of Claim_. Each Notice of Claim by an Indemnified
Party given pursuant to _Section 10.2_ shall contain the following
information, provided, that failure to include all information set forth in
(a) through (c) below shall not render a Notice of Claim invalid unless such
failure materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party (and only to the extent
thereof):

 



 

(a) _Damages_ : that the Indemnified Party has incurred or paid or, in good
faith, believes it shall have to incur or pay, Damages in an aggregate stated
amount

 



      
 

 



 

(where practicable) arising from such Indemnification Claim (which amount may
be the amount of damages claimed by a third party in an action brought against
any Indemnified Party based on alleged facts, which if true, would give rise
to liability for Damages to such Indemnified Party under this _Article X_);

 



 

(b) _Description_ : a brief description, in reasonable detail (to the extent
reasonably available to Indemnified Party), of the facts, circumstances or
events giving rise to the alleged Damages based on Indemnified Partys good
faith belief thereof, including the identity and address of any third-party
claimant (to the extent reasonably available to Indemnified Party) and the
specific nature of the breach to which such claim is related; and

 



 

(c) _Documents_ : copies of any demand or complaint (if any).

 



 

10.5 _Indemnification by the Buyer_.

 



 

(a) _Scope_. The Buyer agrees that, after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sellers and their Affiliates,
officers, directors, members, agents, representatives, successors and assigns
(the " ** _Company Indemnified Persons_** "), from and against any and all
Damages based upon, attributable to or resulting, directly or indirectly, from
(i) the failure of any of the representations or warranties made by the Buyer
in _Article VII_ hereof or in any of the certificates or other instruments or
documents furnished by the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement to be true and
correct in all respects at and as of the date hereof and the Closing Date; or
(ii) the breach of any covenant contained herein that, by its terms, relate to
conduct prior to the Closing Date on the part of the Buyer; _provided_ that
this _Section 10.5_ shall not affect in any manner the remedies of the
Sellers pursuant to _Section 12.12_ hereunder.

 



 

(b) _Limitations_.

 



 

(i) _Deductible_. The indemnification provided for in this _Section 10.5_
shall not apply and the Buyer shall not have any obligations or liability
related to or arising from this Agreement or the Transaction (other than
pursuant to Article III hereof) (whether in contract, tort or otherwise)
unless and until the aggregate Damages exceed the Deductible, in which event
the Company Indemnified Persons shall, subject to the other limitations
herein, be indemnified for only such Damages in excess of the Deductible;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Deductible shall not apply to Fraud Claims
or breaches of the representations and warranties of _Section 7.1_, _Section
7.2_ or _Section 7.5_.

 



 

(ii) _Cap_. The liability of the Buyer pursuant to this _Section 10.5_ shall
be limited to the Cap; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to Damages
related to Fraud Claims or breaches of the representations and warranties of
_Section 7.1_, _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.5_, (i) the Cap shall not apply;
and (ii) such Damages shall

 



      
 

 



 

not be included in any calculation of the aggregate amount of Damages for
purposes of determining whether or not the Cap has been exceeded.

 



 

10.6 _Survival of Covenants, Representations and Warranties_.

 



 

(a) _Representations and Warranties of the Company, the Blocker Corps and the
Sellers_.

 



 

(i) _Non-Fundamental Representations_. All representations and warranties
related to the Company in _Article IV_, the Blocker Corps in _Article V_ and
the Sellers in _Article VI_ (in each case, as modified by the Disclosure
Schedule), other than Fundamental Representations, shall remain operative and
in full force and effect only until the 12 month anniversary of the Closing
Date, _provided_ , that any obligations under _Section 10.1_ shall not
terminate with respect to any Damages as to which the Buyer Indemnified Person
to be indemnified shall have given a Notice of Claim to the Seller in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to the Expiration Date.

 



 

(ii) _Fundamental Representations_. All Fundamental Representations (in each
case, as modified by the Disclosure Schedule) shall remain operative and in
full force and effect only until 60 days following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations for claims against the Company or the
Subsidiaries in respect of the subject matter of such representations. For
avoidance of doubt, each representation under _Section 4.09_ and _Section
5.07_ shall remain operative and in full force and effect until 60 days after
the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessment of Taxes for each
taxable period as to which such representation is relevant in determining Tax
liability of any Buyer Indemnified Person, but subject to the limitations
imposed by _Section 4.9(i)_ and _Section 5.7(j)_.

 



 

(b) _Representations and Warranties of the Buyer_. All representations and
warranties related to the Buyer contained in this Agreement and the other
agreements, certificates and documents contemplated hereby shall remain
operative and in full force and effect, until the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) _Covenants_. All covenants of the parties shall survive according to their
respective terms, except that the Tax Indemnity shall only continue until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for the relevant Pre-
Closing Taxes plus 60 days have expired; provided that the Tax Indemnity shall
continue indefinitely with respect to any claim notice of which has been given
by a Buyer Indemnified Party before the expiration of such period.

 



       
 

 



 

10.7 _Escrow_.

 



 

(a) _Deposit of Indemnity Escrow Amount_. On the Closing Date, the Buyer

immediately available funds, to the account designated by the Indemnity Escrow
Agent, an amount equal to $5,000,000 (the " ** _Indemnity Escrow Amount_** "),
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Escrow as Sole Remedy for Company Breaches_. Any payment any Seller is
obligated to make to the Buyer or to any Buyer Indemnified Person hereunder
with respect to _Sections 10.1(a)(i)_ , (except with respect to breaches of
Fundamental Representations and Fraud Claims) shall be paid subject to the
restrictions set forth in this _Article X_ solely by release of funds to the
Company or, if applicable, any other of the Buyer Indemnified Persons, from
any available Pro-rata Portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount of such Seller
by the Escrow Agent.

 



 

(c) _Remedies for Blocker Corp Breaches and Individual Seller Breaches_. Any
payment any Seller is obligated to make to the Buyer or to any Buyer
Indemnified Person hereunder with respect to a Blocker Corp Breach or an
Individual Seller Breach (other than with respect to breaches of Fundamental
Representations, the Tax Indemnity and Fraud Claims) shall first be paid by
release of funds to the Company, or if applicable, any other of the Buyer
Indemnified Persons, from the Pro-rata Portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount
of such Seller by the Escrow Agent. Damages in excess of such portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be paid promptly by such Seller as a personal
obligation of such Seller, subject to the restrictions set forth in this
_Article X_.

 



 

(d) _Remedies for Breaches of Fundamental Representations, Tax Indemnity and
Fraud Claims_. Any payment the Sellers are obligated to make to the Buyer or
to any Buyer Indemnified Person hereunder with respect to breaches of
Fundamental Representations, the Tax Indemnity and Fraud Claims shall be paid
promptly: (i) by each Seller as a personal obligation of such Seller; (ii)
severally and not jointly with any other Seller; and (iii) up to each Sellers
Pro-rata Portion of applicable Damages and subject to the restrictions set
forth in this _Article X_.

 



 

(e) _Payment from Indemnity Escrow Amount_. To the extent there are sufficient
funds in the Indemnity Escrow Amount, such sums shall be paid within 5
Business Days after the date notice of such sums due and owing is given to the
Sellers (with a copy to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement) by
the Buyer or the Buyer Indemnified Person, as applicable, and shall
accordingly reduce the Indemnity Escrow Amount.

 



 

(f) _Release of Escrow_. On the 12 month anniversary of the date hereof,
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall release
the Indemnity Escrow Amount (to the extent not utilized to pay the Buyer or
any Buyer

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Person for any indemnification claim) to the Seller, except that
the Escrow Agent shall retain an amount (up to the total amount then held by
the Escrow Agent) equal to the amount of claims for indemnification under this
_Article X_ asserted prior to such date but not yet resolved. Any Indemnity
Escrow Amount retained for such unresolved claims shall be released by the
Escrow Agent (to the extent not utilized to pay the Buyer or any Buyer
Indemnified Person for any such claims) upon their resolution in accordance
with this _Article X_ and the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(g) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. EXCEPT FOR FRAUD CLAIMS, THE SOLE RECOURSE
AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF THE BUYER AND BUYER INDEMNIFIED PERSONS FOR ANY
LOSSES, CLAIMS, CAUSES OF ACTION, ACTIONS, AND LIABILITIES ARISING FROM, OUT
OF, OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY COMPANY DOCUMENT, BLOCKER CORP
DOCUMENT OR SELLER DOCUMENT, OR TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY,
WHETHER ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR SUCH DOCUMENTS OR UNDER ANY OTHER
LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY WHATSOEVER, SHALL BE A CLAIM FOR INDEMNIFICATION IN
THE MANNER SET FORTH HEREIN. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, FRAUD CLAIMS SHALL
BE CAPPED AT THE FUNDAMENTAL REPRESENTATIONS CAP.

 



 

(h) _Bargained for Provisions_. The provisions of _Article IX_ were
specifically bargained for and reflected in the amounts payable to the Sellers
in connection with the Closing pursuant to _Article II_.

 



 

10.8 _Exclusion of Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, no party shall, in any event, be liable to any
other Person on account of any indemnity obligation set forth in _Sections
10.1_ or _10.5_ for any special, consequential or punitive damages, in each
case, unless such Damages are paid pursuant to a Third-Party Claim.

 



 

10.9 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Sellers and the Buyer agree to
treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this _Article X_ as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign income
Tax purposes to the extent permitted by Law, and to allocate that payment in
accordance with _Section 3.5_.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI**

11.1 _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the
Closing as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) _Termination Date_. At the election of the Seller Representative or the
Buyer on or after that date which is 60 days after the date hereof (the " **
_Termination Date_** ") if the Closing shall not have occurred by the close of
business on such date; _provided_ that:

 



 

(i) _No Breach_ : the terminating party is not in any breach of any of its
obligations hereunder which has caused the Closing not to occur by the
Termination Date;

 



 

(ii) _Satisfaction of Closing Conditions_ : if all of the conditions set forth
in _Section 9.1_ have been satisfied as of the Termination Date (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at
the Closing), then no party shall be permitted to terminate the Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 11.1(a)_; and

 



 

(b) _Mutual Written Consent_. By mutual written consent of the Seller
Representative and the Buyer; or

 



 

(c) _Material Breach_. By either the Seller Representative or the Buyer if
there shall have been a breach by another party of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement, which breach
would result in the failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth
in _Section 9.1(a)_ (in the case of a breach by the Company, the Blocker
Corps or the Sellers), or _Section 9.2(a)_ (in the case of a breach by the
Buyer), and in any such case such breach shall be incapable of being cured or,
if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured prior to the Termination
Date, _provided_ , that the terminating party may not be in breach in any
material respect of any of its obligations hereunder.

 



 

11.2 _Procedure upon Termination_. In the event of termination and abandonment
by the Buyer or the Seller Representative pursuant to _Section 11.1_ hereof,
written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party or parties,
and this Agreement shall terminate, and the Transaction shall be abandoned,
without further action by the Buyer, the Sellers, the Company or the Blocker
Corps.

 



 

11.3 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) _Relief of Duties and Obligations_. In the event that this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with _Section 11.1_ and _Section 11.2_,
then the parties hereto shall be relieved of their duties and obligations
arising under this Agreement after the date of such termination and such
termination shall be without liability to the Buyer, the Company, the Blocker
Corps or the Sellers; _provided_ , that the obligations of the parties set
forth in _Articles X_ , _XI_ and _XII_ hereof shall survive any such
termination and shall be enforceable hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Liability for Breaches Prior to Termination_. Nothing in this _Section
11.3_ shall relieve the parties hereto of any liability for a breach of any of
its covenants, agreements, representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement prior to the date of termination, which shall be determined pursuant
to _Article X_. The damages recoverable by the non-breaching party shall
include all attorneys fees reasonably incurred by such party in connection
with the Transaction.

 



 

(c) _Survival of Confidentiality Agreement_. The Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive any termination of this Agreement and nothing in this _Section
11.3_ shall relieve the parties hereto of their obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XII**

 



 

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

12.1 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Payment of Sales, Use or Similar Taxes_. All sales, use, transfer,
intangible, recordation, documentary stamp or similar Taxes or charges
incurred by the Buyer, of any nature whatsoever, applicable to, or resulting
from, the Transaction shall be borne by the Buyer.

 



 

(b) _Cooperation_. The Seller, the Company, the Blocker Corps and the Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates,
officers, employees, agents and auditors reasonably to cooperate, in: (i)
preparing and filing all Tax Returns of the Company, the Subsidiaries and the
Blocker Corps, including maintaining and making available to each other all
records necessary in connection with Taxes; (ii) resolving all disputes and
audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes; and (iii)
providing timely notice to each other in writing of any pending or threatened
Tax audits or assessments for all taxable periods for which the other may have
a liability under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Technical Termination; Deduction of Transaction Expenses_. The parties
hereto acknowledge that for United States federal income Tax purposes, the
Transaction is expected to be treated as a termination of the Company pursuant
to Section 708(b)(1)(B) of the Code on the Closing Date. The parties agree
that the Transaction Expenses, to the extent determined to be more likely than
not (by the preparer of the Companys federal income Tax Return for the short
taxable year ending on and including the Closing Date) to be deductible for
United States federal income Tax purposes for its short taxable year ending on
and including the Closing Date, shall be claimed as deductions in the
Companys federal income Tax Return for its short taxable year ending on and
including the Closing Date. None of the parties shall take any tax position

 



      
 

 



 

inconsistent with the foregoing.

 



 

(d) _Preparation of Tax Returns_.

 



 

(i) The Seller Representative shall properly and accurately prepare (or cause
to be prepared), and the Company and any of the Subsidiaries, the Blocker
Corps and Blocker LPs, and the Buyer shall cooperate with the Seller
Representative in the preparation and filing, and timely filing (to the extent
not delinquent as of the date of preparation by the Seller Representative) of,
all income Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of any Blocker
Corp or Blocker LP after the Closing Date for taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date (each a " ** _Seller Prepared Return_** "). The cost
of preparation of Seller Prepared Returns shall be paid by the Sellers. Each
Seller Prepared Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the prior
practice of the Blocker Corps or Blocker LP since June 30, 2011, unless
otherwise required by applicable Tax Law, and shall properly include and
reflect the income, activities, operations and transactions of the Blocker
Corp or Blocker LP through the Closing Date. No later than fifteen (15) days
before the required filing date for each such Seller Prepared Return, the
Seller Representative shall deliver to the Buyer a draft of such Tax Return
and the Buyer shall have the right to review and approve each such Tax Return
before filing, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned,
or delayed.

 



 

(ii) Except for the Seller Prepared Returns, the Buyer shall prepare (or cause
to be prepared) and file (or cause to be filed) each Tax Return required to be
filed by the Company, the Subsidiaries, the Blocker Corps and the Blocker LPs
after the Closing Date for a taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
(each a " ** _Buyer Prepared Return_** "); _provided_ that the Sellers,
severally and not jointly, based on each such Sellers Pro-rata Portion of
such amount, upon the Buyers written request, shall reimburse the Buyer for
all Income Tax Preparation Expenses. To the extent any Tax shown as due on
such Tax Return is payable by any Seller (taking into account indemnification
obligations hereunder), (x) such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the prior practice of the Company, and such Subsidiary,
Blocker Corp or Blocker LP unless otherwise required by applicable Tax Law or
the change from prior practice would not increase the amount of Tax payable by
the Company, any Subsidiary, any Blocker Corp or Blocker LP for which any
Seller is obligated to indemnify the Buyer pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)_; (y)
such Tax Return shall be provided to the Seller Representative at least
fifteen (15) days before the due date for filing such return (or, if required
to be filed within thirty (30) days after the Closing or within thirty (30)
days after the end of the taxable period to which such Tax Return relates, as
soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing); and (z) the Seller
Representative shall have the right to review and approve such Tax

 



      
 

 



 

Return before filing, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed. The Buyer shall make such revisions to such Tax
Returns as are reasonably requested by the Seller Representative and agreed to
by the Buyer (which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

 



 

(iii) Other than any dispute regarding the matters covered by _Section
4.9(h)_ (the reporting of which are subject to _Section 12.1(d)(vi)_ below),
if any dispute with respect to a Tax Return is not resolved before the due
date for filing such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed in the manner
specified by the party that was responsible for initially preparing such Tax
Return under this _Section 12.1(d)_, provided that, in the case of Seller
Prepared Return, the filing of such Tax Return will not require an accrual
under GAAP or disclosure on IRS Schedule UTP of a liability or reserve for any
Pre-Closing Taxes (other than Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return), without
prejudice to the rights of the parties to continue such dispute.

 



 

(iv) Not less than two (2) Business Days before the required payment date of
the Taxes for the taxable period covered by any Seller Prepared Return and
Buyer Prepared Return, if the Seller Representative agrees with the Buyer with
respect to the amount of such payment, the Sellers shall, subject to _Section
10.7_ and the limitations of _Article X_ (and without duplication of any
amount otherwise paid pursuant to _Article X_, and taking into account (that
is, reducing the amount owed by the Sellers) any prior payments against Tax
liability shown as due on such Tax Return), pay to the Buyer in immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Buyer an amount equal to the
amount of such Taxes required to be shown as due on each such Tax Return (or
reasonably estimated by Buyer to be due if such payment is due before the
filing of such Tax Return) and for which any Seller is responsible pursuant to
_Section 10.1_. The delivery of each Seller Prepared Return to Buyer, and
Buyer Prepared Return to the Seller, shall be deemed to constitute a
notification by Buyer of a claim for indemnity against the Sellers for
purposes of _Section 10.2_ in respect of the Taxes shown on such Tax Return
that are subject to indemnification under _Section 10.1_.

 



 

(v) The Sellers shall be entitled to any refund of Pre-Closing Taxes of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any Blocker Corp, received by the Buyer or its
Affiliates (including any overpayment that is credited against Taxes of the
Buyer or its Affiliates otherwise due and payable that are not Pre-Closing
Taxes of the Company, its Subsidiaries or a Blocker Corp); provided that no
payment shall be required under this _Section 12.1(d)(v)_ to the extent that
the overpayment of Pre-Closing Taxes so refunded or credited (i) is
attributable to a carryback of losses, credits and similar attributes of the
Company, a Subsidiary or a Blocker Corp from a taxable period ending after the
Closing Date or (ii) the entitlement to

 



      
 

 



 

such refund is reflected as a Current Asset in Closing Working Capital. Any
payments otherwise required to be made under this _Section 12.1(d)(v)_ shall
be reduced by the amount any Tax payable by the Buyer or its Affiliates with
respect to the receipt of crediting of such Tax overpayment or interest
thereon, and all costs reasonably incurred by the Buyer or its Affiliates in
securing the refund or credit of such overpayment. After receipt or crediting
of such overpayment, the Buyer shall cause the Company, its Subsidiaries or
the Blocker Corps to promptly remit such refunds to the Escrow Agent, if such
is paid before the Escrow Amount is released pursuant to the Escrow Agreement,
and otherwise to the Seller Representative.

 



 

(vi) The parties agree that Buyer shall be entitled to rely on the continuing
accuracy of the representation set forth at _Section 4.9(h)_ for so long as
the subject matter of such representation is material to the Tax liability of
any Buyer Indemnified Party, provided such reliance shall be expressly
conditioned on the Buyers preparing (or causing to be prepared) all relevant
Tax Returns of Buyer and its Affiliates in a manner that does not reflect a
position that Section 197(f)(9) of the Code prohibits amortization of any
basis arising from consummation of the transactions effected in connection
with the 2011 Agreement unless the Buyer is otherwise required pursuant to a
final determination within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code or
otherwise pursuant to a judicial determination. In the event that Buyer or any
of its Affiliates is at any time required to establish a reserve in its
financial statements for any Tax liabilities that may result from failure to
sustain such reporting position, the Seller Representative shall expeditiously
take such actions and commence such proceedings as are reasonably requested by
the Buyer to obtain such a final determination or judicial determination
regarding the applicability of section 197(f)(9) to the transactions effected
in connection with the 2011 Agreement. The Seller Representative (at its cost)
shall be entitled to control the conduct of such proceedings through legal
counsel of its choice, and Buyer (at its cost) shall be entitled to
participate in such proceedings through its own counsel. If the Seller
Representative declines to control the conduct of such proceedings, the Buyer
shall be entitled to conduct such proceedings through legal counsel of its
choice and, in such case, the Sellers, severally and not jointly, based on
each such Sellers Pro-rata Portion of such amount, shall indemnify Buyer for
all reasonable costs incurred in seeking such a determination. No action
reasonably taken by Buyer to obtain such a determination under the foregoing
circumstances (whether such proceeding is conducted by the Buyer or the Seller
Representative) shall impair Buyers right to rely on the representation set
forth in _Section 4.9(h)_. Until a final determination is made in any such
proceeding, the amount of Taxes required to be reserved in the financial
statements of Buyer or its Affiliates shall not constitute a Damage required
to be indemnified by Sellers under this Agreement except to the extent such
Tax has been assessed against and has been

 



      
 

 



 

paid by a Buyer Indemnified Party. After payment by the Sellers to any Buyer
Indemnified Person of Damages consisting of Taxes incurred by a Buyer
Indemnified Person by reason of a reduction in amortization deductions
resulting from circumstances constituting a breach of _Section 4.9(h)_, such
amount paid as Damages by Sellers shall be promptly remitted, as if it were a
refund or credit subject to _Section 12.1(d)(v)_, to the Escrow Agent or the
Seller Representative to the extent that such determination has resulted in an
abatement of the Taxes to which the Damages previously paid by Sellers
related, provided that the amount of such abated Taxes shall not be so
remitted until the earlier of actual receipt of a refund or benefit of such
overpaid Taxes by any Buyer Indemnified Person due to such determination
(including any overpayment that is credited against Taxes of the Buyer or its
Affiliates otherwise due and payable in respect of which no indemnity is
payable to a Buyer Indemnified Person under this Agreement).

 



 

12.2 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, each party to this
Agreement shall bear its respective fees, costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of
this Agreement or the Transaction (including legal, accounting and other
professional fees). Without limiting the foregoing, (a) the Buyer shall pay
and be solely responsible for all filing fees payable under the HSR Act and
(b) the Sellers, severally and not jointly, based on each such Sellers Pro-
rata Portion of such amount, shall reimburse the Company upon written request
for any Transaction Expenses to the extent such expenses have not previously
been included in the calculation of the Purchase Price on the Closing Date or
Final Working Capital; _provided_ that the foregoing clause (b) shall only
apply to any such Transaction Expenses that the Company or the Buyer have
provided written notice to the Seller Representative within twelve (12) months
after the Closing Date, which notice shall include the amount of and the payee
for such Transaction Expenses and other documentation related thereto
reasonably requested by the Seller Representative.

 



 

12.3 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process; Waiver of
Jury_.

 



 

(a) _Jurisdiction and Venue_. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to
the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court located within
the State of Delaware over any dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the Transaction and each party hereby irrevocably agrees
that all claims in respect of such dispute or any suit, action proceeding
related thereto may be heard and determined in such courts. The parties hereby
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for
the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Service of Process_. Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to
process being served by any party to this Agreement in any suit, action or
proceeding by the delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions
of _Section 12.7_.

 



 

(c) _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law any right it may have to a trial by
jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of,
under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transaction. Each of the
parties hereto hereby (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney
of the other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing
waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it has been induced to enter into this
agreement and the Transaction, as applicable, by, among other things, the
mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 12.3(c)_.

 



 

12.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the schedules and exhibits
hereto), the Transaction Documents, the Confidentiality Agreement, and each
other agreement, document, instrument or certificate contemplated hereby or to
be executed in connection with the Transaction, represent the entire
understanding and agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof, and supersede all prior agreements among
the parties respecting the Transaction. The parties hereto have voluntarily
agreed to define their rights, liabilities and obligations respecting the
Transaction exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and
provisions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents, and the parties
hereto expressly disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled to any
remedies not expressly set forth in this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents.

 



 

12.5 _Amendments and Waivers._ This Agreement can be amended, supplemented or
changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument
making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the party against whom
enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is
sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any
investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver by any party
hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be
construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of
any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. All
remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other remedies
provided by law.

 



 

12.6 _Governing Law_. All matters relating to the interpretation,

 



      
 

 



 

construction, validity and enforcement of this Agreement, including all claims
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement or the Transaction (including any claim or cause or action cased
upon, arising out of, or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic
laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware.

 



 

12.7 _Notices_. All notices and other communications under this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be deemed given: (i) when delivered personally
by hand (with written confirmation of receipt); (ii) when sent by facsimile
(with written confirmation of transmission); (iii) when received or rejected
by the addressee if sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid,
return receipt requested; or (iv) one Business Day following the day sent by

12.8 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
Transaction is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal,
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
Transaction is consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.

 



 

12.9 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Except as expressly provided herein, this Agreement is for
the sole benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns and
nothing herein expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give any
Person, other than the parties and such permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable rights hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties
hereto specifically acknowledge and agree that the provisions of _Section
8.7_ hereof are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, all current or former directors, managers, officers, employees or
shareholders of the Company or the Subsidiaries (in all of their capacities)
affected thereby. No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or
obligations hereunder may be made by any party hereto, directly or indirectly
(by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the
Seller Representative or the Buyer, as the case may be, and any attempted
assignment without the required consent shall be void. No assignment of any
obligations hereunder shall relieve the parties hereto of any such
obligations.

 



      
 

 



 

12.10 _No Strict Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any
Person. The parties hereto each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement
embodies the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from
arms length negotiations; all parties to this Agreement specifically
acknowledge that no party has any special relationship with another party that
would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary purchaser and an
ordinary seller in an arms length transaction.

 



 

12.11 _Non-Recourse_. Except as permitted by applicable Law, (i) all claims,
obligations, liabilities or cause of action (whether in contract or in tort,
in law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect
of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any
manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in, in connection
with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement) may be made only against (and
are those solely of) the entities that are expressly identified as parties to
this Agreement in the Preamble to this Agreement; and (ii) no Person who is
not identified as a Party to this Agreement in the Preamble hereto shall have
any liabilities (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or
granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations or
liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with or related in any manner
to this Agreement or based on, in respect of or by reason of this Agreement or
its negotiation, execution, performance or breach.

 



 

12.12 _Specific Enforcement_.

 



 

(a) _Entitlement to Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, and that money damages or legal remedies would not be an adequate
remedy for any such damages. Therefore, it is accordingly agreed that prior to
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 11.1_, the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
restrain any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by any other party
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of any other party, in any court of competent
jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and granted
in connection therewith. If any party brings any action to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other
party, the party bringing such action may extend the Termination Date
(notwithstanding the termination provisions of _Section 11.1(a)_) so long as
the party bringing such action: (i) is actively seeking a court order for an
injunction or injunctions or to specifically enforce the terms and provisions
of this Agreement; and (ii) is not, as of the applicable Termination Date, in
breach of any of its obligations hereunder which would give rise to the
failure of a condition to closing set forth in Article IX.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Waiver of Defenses and Bond_. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives:
(i) any defenses in any action for specific performance, including the defense
that a remedy at Law would be adequate; and (ii) any requirement under any Law
to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable
relief.

 



 

(c) _Specific Performance Declined_. If a court of competent jurisdiction has
declined to specifically enforce the obligations of any party hereto to
consummate the Closing pursuant to a claim for performance brought against
such parties pursuant to this _Section 12.11_, the other parties shall not be
limited in any respect in pursuing any other remedy or recourse available to
it under applicable Law.

 



 

12.13 _Seller Representative_.

 



 

(a) _Appointment of Seller Representative_. The Sellers hereby irrevocably
appoint Summit Partners Private Equity Fund VII-A, L.P. as the sole
representative of the Sellers (the " ** _Seller Representative_** ") to act as
the agent and on behalf of such Sellers regarding any matter under this
Agreement, including for the purposes of: (i) making decisions and entering
into settlements with respect to the determination of the Closing Working
Capital and related matters; (ii) determining whether the conditions to
closing in _Article IX_ have been satisfied and supervising the Closing,
including waiving any condition, as determined by the Seller Representative,
in its sole discretion; (iii) taking any action that may be necessary or
desirable, as determined by the Seller Representative, in its sole discretion,
in connection with the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article XI_; (iv) accepting notices on behalf of the Sellers in accordance
with _Section 12.7_ of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; (v)
executing and delivering, on behalf of the Sellers, any and all notices,
documents or certificates to be executed by the Sellers, in connection with
this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreements and the Transaction; (vi) making any
payments or paying any expenses under or in connection with this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement; (vii) granting any consent or approval on behalf of
the Sellers under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; and (x) resolving
or acting with respect to claims for indemnity hereunder.

 



 

(b) _Indemnification of Seller Representative_. None of the Seller
Representative nor any of its respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, attorneys in fact or Affiliates shall be: (i) liable to any other
Seller or its Affiliates for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken
by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement (except to the
extent that any of the foregoing are found by a final and nonappealable
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or
such Persons intentional willful misconduct). The Seller Representative shall
not be under any obligation to the other Sellers or their Affiliates to
ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement, or to inspect the
properties, books or records of the Company or the

 



      
 

 



 

subsidiaries.

 



 

12.14 _Conflicts; Privileges_.

 



 

(a) _Acknowledgement of Representation_. It is acknowledged by each of the
parties hereto that the Company, the Blocker Corps and the Sellers have
retained Proskauer Rose LLP (" ** _Proskauer_** ") to act as their counsel in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and that Proskauer has
not acted as counsel for any other Person in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and that no other party to this Agreement or Person has
the status of a client of Proskauer for conflict of interest or any other
purposes as a result thereof.

 



 

(b) _Affirmation of Representation_. The Buyer hereby agrees that, in the
event that a dispute arises between the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company, the Blocker Corps or any of the
Subsidiaries) and any Seller or any of its Affiliates (including, prior to the
Closing, the Company, the Blocker Corps or any of the Subsidiaries), Proskauer
may represent such Sellers or any such Affiliates in such dispute even though
the interests of such Seller or such Affiliate may be directly adverse to the
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company, the
Blocker Corps or any of the Subsidiaries), and even though Proskauer may have
represented the Company, a Blocker Corp or a Subsidiary in a matter
substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for
the Buyer, the Company, a Blocker Corp or a Subsidiary.

 



 

(c) _Waiver of Conflict_. The Buyer and the Company hereby waive, on behalf of
themselves and each of their Affiliates: (i) any claim they have or may have
that Proskauer has a conflict of interest in connection with or is otherwise
prohibited from engaging in such representation; (ii) agree that, in the event
that a dispute arises after the Closing between the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company or any Subsidiary) and the Seller or any
Affiliate thereof, Proskauer may represent any such party in such dispute even
though the interest of any such party may be directly adverse to the Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including the Company or any Subsidiary) and even
though Proskauer may have represented the Company or the Subsidiaries in a
matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing
matters for the Buyer, the Company or the Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) _Retention of Privilege_. The Buyer, the Sellers, the Company, the Blocker
Corps and the Subsidiaries further agree that, as to all communications among
Proskauer, the Sellers, the Blocker Corps, the Company and the Subsidiaries
that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence and all other
rights to any evidentiary privilege belong to the Sellers and may be
controlled by the Seller Representative and shall not pass to or be claimed by
the Buyer, the Blocker Corps, the Company or any Subsidiaries.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Further Assurances_. The Buyer, the Sellers and the Company agree to
take, and to cause their respective Affiliates to take, all steps necessary to
implement the intent of this _Section 12.14_. The Buyer, the Sellers and the
Company further agree that Proskauer and its partners and employees are third
party beneficiaries of this _Section 12.14_.

 



 

12.15 _Absence of Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. Except as expressly set
forth in _Section 8.7_, _Article X_ and _Section 12.14_, no provision of
this Agreement is intended, nor will be interpreted, to provide or create any
third party beneficiary rights or any other rights of any kind in any client,
customer, Affiliate, security holder, employee or partner of any party hereto
or any other Person.

 



 

12.16 _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, shall be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement.
