Section 2.10 Post-Closing Statement. As promptly as reasonably possible and in
any event within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser will
prepare or cause to be prepared, and will provide to Seller, a written
statement setting forth in reasonable detail its determination of the Working
Capital as of as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the day immediately preceding
the Closing Date (the "Working Capital Statement"). The Working Capital
Statement shall set forth the calculations of such amounts in a manner
consistent with the Closing Statement and shall be prepared in accordance with
the Accounting Principles.

Section 2.11 Reconciliation of Statements. (a) Purchaser will give, and cause
its applicable Subsidiaries to give, Seller and its Representatives prompt and
reasonable access to all information, books, records, data and working papers,
in each case to the extent related to the Business, and shall permit access to
its personnel and facilities as may be reasonably required in order to verify
the content of the Working Capital Statement and the resolution of any
disputes thereunder. Within forty-five (45) days following receipt by Seller
of the Working Capital Statement (the "Review Period"), Seller shall provide a
written notice to Purchaser of any dispute Seller has with respect to the
calculation, preparation or content of the Working Capital Statement (a
"Dispute Notice"). The Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail (i)
any item on the Working Capital Statement that Seller disputes and (ii) the
correct amount of such item; provided, that Seller may not dispute the
accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies used in preparing
the Working Capital Statement unless they are not in accordance with the
Accounting Principles. If no Dispute Notice is received by Purchaser by the
end of the Review Period, then the Working Capital Statement shall be deemed
to have been accepted by Seller and shall become final and binding upon the
parties.



(b) Purchaser and Seller will attempt to resolve the matters raised in a
Dispute Notice in good faith within thirty (30) days after delivery of the
Dispute Notice (the "Resolution Period").

(c) If no agreement is reached by the parties during the Resolution Period,
either Purchaser or Seller may provide written notice to the other that it
elects to submit the disputed items to an internationally recognized
independent accounting firm chosen jointly by Purchaser and Seller (the
"Working Capital Referee"). If Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on a
Working Capital Referee within ten (10) Business Days after the end of the
Resolution Period, then each of Seller and Purchaser shall select an
internationally recognized independent accounting firm, and the two (2) firms
will, within ten (10) Business Days, mutually select a third internationally
recognized independent accounting firm to serve as the Working Capital
Referee. As promptly as practicable, and in any event not more than ten (10)
Business Days following the engagement of the Working Capital Referee, Seller
and Purchaser shall each prepare and submit to the Working Capital Referee a
presentation detailing each party's complete statement of proposed resolution
of each issue still in dispute. The Working Capital Referee will promptly
review each such presentation and resolve each disputed item and amount in
accordance with the Accounting Principles; provided, that the Working Capital
Referee shall not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value
for such item, or lower than the lowest value of such item reflected in the
Working Capital Statement and the Dispute Notice. The fees and expenses of the
Working Capital Referee will be shared equally by Seller and Purchaser. Each
of the parties to this Agreement agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the Working Capital Referee and to cause the Working
Capital Referee to resolve any dispute no later than twenty (20) Business Days
after selection of the Working Capital Referee. The Working Capital Statement
that is final and binding on the parties, as determined either through
agreement of the parties pursuant to Section 2.11(a) or Section 2.11(b), or
through the decision of the Working Capital Referee pursuant to this Section
2.11(c), is referred to as the "Final Working Capital Statement"). The parties
agree that any adjustment as determined pursuant to Section 2.11(b) or this
Section 2.11(c) shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price,
except as otherwise required by Law.

Section 2.12 Post-Closing Adjustment. Promptly, and in any event no later than
the fifth (5th) Business Day, after the final determination of the Working
Capital in accordance with Section 2.11: (a) if the amount of final Working
Capital set forth in the Final Working Capital Statement exceeds the estimated
Working Capital set forth in the Closing Statement, then Purchaser will pay
(or cause to be paid) an amount in cash equal to such excess amount to Seller
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Seller to Purchaser; and (b) if the amount of final
Working Capital set forth in the Final Working Capital Statement is less than
the estimated Working Capital set forth in the Closing Certificate, then
Seller will pay (or cause to be paid) an amount in cash equal to such
shortfall to Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by Purchaser to Seller.

Section 2.13 Purchase Price Allocation.

(a) Seller and Purchaser agree to allocate and, as applicable, to cause their
relevant Affiliates to allocate, the Purchase Price, the adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.11, if any (the "Working Capital
Adjustment"), and any other items that are treated as



additional consideration for Tax purposes (including the assumption of any
Liabilities) among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Exhibit B attached
hereto (the "Allocation Principles").

(b) No later than sixty (60) days after the Working Capital Adjustment is
finally determined pursuant to Section 2.11, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller
a proposed allocation of the Purchase Price (as finally determined pursuant to
Section 2.11) and any other items that are treated as additional consideration
for Tax purposes (including the assumption of any Liabilities) as of the
Closing Date determined in a manner consistent with the Allocation Principles,
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder
(the "Purchaser's Allocation"). If Seller disagrees with Purchaser's
Allocation, Seller may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of Purchaser's
Allocation, deliver a notice (the "Seller's Allocation Notice") to Purchaser
to such effect, specifying those items as to which Seller disagrees and
setting forth Seller's proposed allocation. If the Seller's Allocation Notice
is duly delivered, Seller and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to
determine the allocation of the Purchase Price, the Working Capital Adjustment
and any other items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax
purposes (including the assumption of any Liabilities). If Seller and
Purchaser are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter
cause the Working Capital Referee to resolve any remaining disputes. Any
allocation of the Purchase Price (as finally determined pursuant to Section
2.11) and any other items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax
purposes determined pursuant to the decision of the Working Capital Referee
shall incorporate, reflect and be consistent with the Allocation Principles.
The Purchaser's Allocation, if no Seller's Allocation Notice has been given,
as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between Seller and Purchaser, or as
determined by the Working Capital Referee (the "Final Allocation"), shall be
conclusive and binding on all Parties (and their respective Affiliates) for
purposes of filing their Tax Returns. Seller and Purchaser shall (and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to) prepare and file all Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with the Final Allocation, except, in each case, to the
extent otherwise required as a result of the resolution of a Tax audit or
similar Tax Proceeding in accordance with the immediately succeeding sentence
or any other Tax Proceeding. If the Final Allocation is subject to a challenge
by any Taxing Authority in connection with a Tax audit or similar Tax
Proceeding, Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, in good faith and using commercially
reasonable efforts, defend the Final Allocation against such challenge;
provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that none of Seller, Purchaser or any of
their respective Affiliates shall be required to appeal, petition or take any
similar action with respect to any decision made upon a Tax audit or any other
Tax Proceedings. Any fees and expenses of the Working Capital Referee shall be
borne equally by Seller and Purchaser.

Section 2.14 Non-Assignment; Consents. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to
sell, assign, transfer or convey any Purchased Asset if an attempted sale,
assignment, transfer or conveyance thereof would be prohibited by Law or
would, without the approval, authorization or consent of, filing with,
notification to, or granting or issuance of any license, order, waiver or
permit by, any Person (collectively, "Approvals"), (i) constitute a breach or
other contravention thereof, (ii) be ineffective, void or voidable, or (iii)
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Seller Entities, Purchaser, or



any of their respective officers, directors, agents or Affiliates, unless and
until such Approval is obtained.

(b) Seller and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain,
or cause to be obtained, any Approval (other than Regulatory Approvals, which
shall be governed by Section 5.1) required to sell, assign or transfer any
Purchased Asset and to obtain the unconditional release of Seller and its
Affiliates so that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible
for the Assumed Liabilities. If such Approval is not obtained prior to the
Closing, until the earlier of (i) such time as such Approval or Approvals are
obtained or (ii) with respect to Business Contracts with an Original Equipment
Manufacturer (each such manufacturer, an "OEM," and each such Business
Contract, an "OEM Program"), the end of life of the applicable OEM vehicle
production life and, with respect to any other Purchased Asset, three (3)
years following the Closing Date, then Seller will cooperate with Purchaser in
any arrangement reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller intended to both
(x) provide Purchaser and its Affiliates, to the fullest extent practicable,
the claims, rights and benefits of any such Purchased Assets (including by
means of any subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangement) and (y)
cause Purchaser and its Affiliates to bear the related costs and Liabilities
thereunder to the extent that Purchaser and its Affiliates receive the rights
and benefits of such Purchased Assets from and after the Closing in accordance
with this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser will, and will
cause the other Purchaser Entities to, promptly pay, perform or discharge when
due any related Liability (including Liability for Taxes, if any, as
determined in accordance with Section 2.14(d)) arising thereunder after the
Closing Date to the extent that Purchaser and its Affiliates receive the
rights and benefits of such Purchased Assets.

(c) Any Contract to be assigned, transferred and conveyed in accordance with
Section 2.4(a) that does not exclusively relate to the Business (each, a
"Shared Contract") shall be assigned, transferred and conveyed only with
respect to (and preserving the meaning of) those parts that relate to the
Business, to Purchaser or a Purchaser Entity designated by Purchaser, if so
assignable, transferrable or conveyable, or appropriately amended prior to, on
or after the Closing, so that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be entitled
to the rights and benefit of those parts of the Shared Contract that relate to
the Business and shall assume the related portion of any Liabilities
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Purchaser Portion of the Shared Contract
Liabilities"); provided, however, that (i) in no event shall any Person be
required to assign (or amend), either in its entirety or in part, any Shared
Contract that is not assignable (or cannot be amended) by its terms without
obtaining one or more Approvals and (ii) if any Shared Contract cannot be so
partially assigned by its terms or otherwise, or cannot be amended, without
such Approval or Approvals, until the earlier of (A) such time as such
Approval or Approvals are obtained or (B) with respect to OEM Programs, the
end of life of the applicable OEM vehicle production life and, with respect to
any other Purchased Asset, three (3) years following the Closing Date, then
Seller will cooperate with Purchaser to establish an agency type or other
similar arrangement reasonably satisfactory to Seller and Purchaser intended
to both (x) provide Purchaser and its Affiliates, to the fullest extent
practicable under such Shared Contract, the claims, rights and benefits of
those parts that relate to the Business (including by means of any
subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangement) and (y) cause
Purchaser and its Affiliates to bear the costs and Liabilities thereunder to
the extent that Purchaser and its Affiliates receive the rights and benefits
of the parts of such Shared Contracts



that relate to the Business from and after the Closing in accordance with this
Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser will, and will cause the
other Purchaser Entities to, promptly pay, perform or discharge when due any
Liability (including Liability for Taxes, if any, as determined in accordance
with Section 2.14(d)) arising thereunder after the Closing Date to the extent
that Purchaser and its Affiliates receive the rights and benefits of the parts
of such Shared Contracts that relate to the Business.

(d) To the extent not prohibited by applicable Tax Laws (and to the extent
consistent with the relevant arrangement agreed to by Seller and Purchaser
pursuant to Section 2.14(b) or 2.14(c)), Seller and Purchaser agree to treat
and report, and to cause their respective Affiliates to treat and report, on
their Tax Returns, the Purchased Assets that are subject to the provisions of
this Section 2.14 (the "Non-Transferred Assets") as assets owned by the
applicable Purchaser Entity. Each of Seller and Purchaser agrees to notify the
other party promptly in writing if it determines that such treatment (to the
extent consistent with the relevant arrangement agreed to by Seller and
Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.14(b) or 2.14(c)) is not permitted under
applicable Tax Laws. Where such treatment is not permitted under applicable
Tax Laws, and subject to the terms of any relevant arrangement agreed to by
Seller and Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.14(b) or 2.14(c), the amount of the
Liability for Taxes imposed on Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to
any Non-Transferred Asset for any Post-Closing Period, if any, for which
Purchaser and the Purchaser Entities are responsible shall be calculated on a
"with and without" basis. Seller shall provide, and shall cause its Affiliates
to provide, Purchaser with a reasonable opportunity to review the relevant
portion of any applicable Tax Returns relating to any Non-Transferred Assets
(and accompanying schedules, calculations and other reasonably requested work
papers) as necessary for determining such Tax Liability; provided, that, in
the case of Tax Returns of Seller, any Seller Entity or any of their
respective Affiliates (or of a consolidated, combined, unitary or Tax group
including any of them), Seller may, in lieu of delivering the Tax Returns,
deliver to Purchaser pro-forma statements setting forth in sufficient detail
the information relevant for determining the relevant Tax Liability. If Seller
and Purchaser are unable to reach an agreement in respect of any dispute
concerning such Tax Liability, they shall promptly submit any such dispute for
resolution to the Working Capital Referee. All costs and expenses of the
Working Capital Referee shall be borne equally by Seller and Purchaser.

Section 2.15 Tax Withholding. Subject to the compliance by the relevant Seller
Entities with their respective obligations under Section 2.8(b)(iv), except to
the extent otherwise provided in this Section 2.15, all payments hereunder
shall be free and clear of any deduction or withholding for Taxes. To the
extent that any of the relevant Seller Entities fails to comply with its
obligations under Section 2.8(b)(iv), the Purchaser Entities shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable hereunder to the
relevant Seller Entities such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to such payment under Section 1445 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. In the event Purchaser reasonably
determines that any portion of the Purchase Price is or would reasonably be
expected to be subject to withholding under applicable Tax Law, Purchaser
shall promptly notify Seller of such determination in writing, but in no event
less than fourteen (14) days prior to the Closing Date (or, in the event such
determination is based, in whole or in part, on a change in applicable Tax Law
(including any published interpretation by the relevant Taxing Authority)
occurring within thirty (30) days prior to the Closing



Date, or, if applicable, after the Closing Date, such notification shall be
made in writing as soon as reasonably practicable). During the five (5)-day
period following the delivery of such notice, Seller shall review such notice
and shall advise Purchaser in writing of any disagreement. Seller and
Purchaser shall endeavor in good faith to resolve any such disagreement. If
Seller and Purchaser cannot resolve any disagreement regarding any proposed
withholding by Purchaser during such five (5)-day period, Seller shall have
the opportunity to deliver to Purchaser an opinion of nationally recognized
tax counsel in the relevant jurisdiction, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser, to the effect that, at a "more likely than not"
confidence level (or such higher confidence level as may be required to avoid
the imposition of penalties on a taxpayer in the relevant jurisdiction), no
such proposed withholding is required. If such opinion is delivered to the
Purchaser at least two (2) days prior to the anticipated Closing Date (or the
date on which a payment, if any, is due after the Closing Date), the Purchaser
Entities shall not withhold on such portion of the Purchase Price. Subject to
Section 6.6, to the extent that amounts are deducted and withheld in respect
of Taxes by any of the Purchaser Entities in compliance with this Section
2.15, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Seller Entity in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

Except as set forth in, or qualified by any matter set forth in the Seller
Disclosure Schedules (it being agreed that the disclosure of any matter in any
section in the Seller Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to have been
disclosed in any other section in the Seller Disclosure Schedules to which the
applicability of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face), Seller
hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows:

Section 3.1 Organization, Standing and Power. Each of the Seller Entities is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its
jurisdiction of organization and in which it conducts activities related to
the Business and is required to so qualify, except where the failure to so
qualify has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect. Each of
the Seller Entities has all necessary organizational power and authority to
carry on the Business as presently conducted, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impair the ability of the Seller Entities to perform their
obligations under this Agreement or consummate the Transaction or the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 3.2 Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability. Seller has all
necessary power and authority to execute this Agreement and to consummate the
Transaction and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and
delivery by Seller of this Agreement and the consummation by the Seller
Entities of the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated hereby
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other action of the
Seller Entities. Seller has duly executed and delivered this Agreement, and
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Purchaser, this
Agreement will constitute its valid and binding obligation, enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any Laws
relating to bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent
conveyance or preferential transfers, or similar Laws relating to or affecting
creditors' rights generally and subject, as to



enforceability, to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a Proceeding in equity or at
law).

Section 3.3 No Conflicts; Consents. (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.3(a)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, the execution and delivery by Seller of
this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance by Seller with the terms
hereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or default (with
or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, require the Approval of
any Person (other than any Governmental Entity) under, or give rise to a right
of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to a loss of
a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted
Liens) upon any of the Purchased Assets under, any provision of (i) the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or equivalent governing documents of any
Seller Entity or (ii) any Judgment or Law applicable to the Business or the
Purchased Assets, or (iii) any Business Contract to which any Seller Entity is
a party or by which any Seller Entity's property or assets are bound, except,
in each case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such items that would not
reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to
the Business.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 3.3(b)(i) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules, no Approval of any Governmental Entity, labor union, works council
or other labor organization is required to be obtained or made by or with
respect to the Seller Entities in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transaction and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, other than (ii) in respect of any
applicable Law or other legal restraint designed to govern competition, trade
regulation, foreign investment, or national security or defense matters or to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions with the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, the "Antitrust Laws"),
(iii) in respect of any licenses or permits relating to the Business listed on
Section 3.3(b)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules and (iv) those that, if
not obtained, made or given, would not reasonably be expected to be,

Section 3.4 Proceedings. There are no Proceedings or claims pending or, to the
Knowledge of Seller, threatened, against the Seller Entities with respect to
the Business, or any Business Employee with respect to the Business except as
would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the Business. There are no Proceedings or claims pending, or to
the Knowledge of Seller, threatened against the Seller Entities that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impair the ability of Seller to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or consummate the Transaction and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 3.5(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules sets forth true and complete

unaudited combined statement of net investment of the Business as of March 31,
2013 and (iii) the unaudited combined statements of income of the Business for

financial condition and results of operations of the Business as of the date

noted therein.

(d) The Business does not have any Liabilities that would be required by GAAP

consistent with past practice, (iii) are Retained Liabilities, (iv) are

(e) The Seller Entities maintain systems of internal accounting controls with
respect to the Business designed to provide reasonable assurances that: (i)
transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific
authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP in all material
respects and to maintain accountability for items; (iii) access to assets is
permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific
authorization; (iv) recorded accountability for items is compared with actual
levels at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to
any differences.

Section 3.6 Absence of Changes or Events. (b) Except in connection with or in
preparation for the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, since the Balance Sheet Date through the date of this
Agreement, the Business has been conducted in all material respects in the
ordinary course consistent with past practice.

(c) Since the Balance Sheet Date through the date of this Agreement, Seller
has not taken any action that, if taken after the date of this Agreement,
would have required the consent of Purchaser under Sections 5.2(b)(i),
5.2(b)(v), 5.2(b)(vii), 5.2(b)(viii), 5.2(b)(ix) or 5.2(b)(xiii).

(d) Since the Balance Sheet Date through the Closing Date, (i) there has not
been nor has there occurred any event, change, development or effect that has
had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect and (ii) there has not occurred
any event set forth on Section 3.6(c)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules.

Section 3.7 Title; Sufficiency of Assets. (c) The Seller Entities own all
rights, title and interests in and to the Purchased Assets free and clear of
all Liens, other than Permitted Liens. As of the execution of the conveyance
document from the Seller Entities to Purchaser for any Purchased Asset, and
assuming receipt of all Approvals required for the sale, assignment, transfer
or conveyance of such Purchased Assets to Purchaser, Purchaser shall own all
rights, title and interests in and to the Purchased Assets free and clear of
all Liens, other than Permitted Liens.

(d) As of the Closing, the Purchased Assets, (i) taking into account the
Transaction Documents and all of the assets, services, products, real
property, Intellectual Property



and Know-How to be provided, acquired, leased or licensed under the
Transaction Documents and (ii) assuming all Approvals and Business Permits
have been obtained or transferred, constitute all of the assets, properties,
rights and Contracts necessary and sufficient to conduct the Business in all
material respects in the manner currently conducted by the Seller Entities.

Section 3.8 Intellectual Property. (a) As of the Closing, Section 2.4(b)(i) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedules sets forth a true and complete list of all
registered Patents, Marks and copyrights, including applications therefor,
primarily related to the Business, as of the date of this Agreement and
indicates with respect to each item, (i) the record owner, (ii) the
jurisdiction where the application/registration is located (or, for domain
names, the applicable registrar), (iii) the application or registration number
and (iv) the filing date and issuance/registration/grant date. As of the
Closing, Section 2.4(b)(ii) of the Seller Disclosures Schedule identifies each
Contract that is primarily related to the Business under which Seller or any
of its Affiliates is granted a license to Intellectual Property.

(b) None of the Business Intellectual Property is subject to any Judgment
adversely affecting the use thereof or rights thereto by Seller and its
Subsidiaries. There is no opposition or cancellation Proceeding pending
against Seller and its Subsidiaries concerning the ownership, validity,
enforceability or infringement of any Business Intellectual Property. To the
Knowledge of Seller, there is no infringement or misappropriation, or other
violation, or any written allegation made thereof, of any Business
Intellectual Property. Neither Seller nor its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice within the three (3)-year period prior to the date of this
Agreement alleging that the operation of the Business infringes,
misappropriates, violates or otherwise conflicts with the Intellectual
Property of any other Person. To the Knowledge of the Seller, the operation of
the Business does not infringe, misappropriate, violate or otherwise conflict
with the Intellectual Property of another Person.

(c) (i) The Seller Entities own all rights, title, and interests in and to the
Business Intellectual Property, including the Intellectual Property set forth
on Section 2.4(b)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules (other than Business
Intellectual Property licensed to the Seller Entities under a Business
Contract), free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens; (ii) the
Seller Entities own or are licensed or otherwise possess rights to use or
exploit all Business Intellectual Property necessary to conduct the Business
as presently conducted, free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted
Liens (except, in the case of licenses, the interests of the licensing party
and the terms and conditions of such licenses); (iii) the Business
Intellectual Property, together with the Retained Intellectual Property
licensed to Purchaser under the Cross License, constitute all Intellectual
Property as of the date of this Agreement owned, controlled or licensed by the
Seller and its Affiliates related to the Business; and (iv) the Business
Intellectual Property includes all Intellectual Property primarily related to
the Business.

(d) No Business Intellectual Property is subject to any final and non-
appealable order, judgment, injunction, decree or arbitral award stipulation
that (i) restricts the use or other practice or exploitation thereof by any
Seller Entity, (ii) restricts the sale, transfer, assignment or licensing
thereof by any Seller Entity, or (iii) obligates any Seller Entity to grant
licenses in the future with respect to any Business Intellectual Property.



(e) In each case in which any Seller Entity has acquired ownership of any
Business Intellectual Property from any Person (including any employee,
officer, director, consultant and contractor of Seller or any Subsidiary), the
Seller Entity has obtained a valid and enforceable assignment sufficient to
irrevocably transfer ownership of any and all rights with respect to such
Business Intellectual Property to such Seller Entity. All assignments of
Business Intellectual Property to the Seller Entities that are or may be
required to be filed or recorded in order to be valid and effective against
bona fide purchasers without notice of such assignment have been duly executed
and filed and recorded with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and any
applicable Governmental Entity elsewhere.

(f) To the Knowledge of Seller, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates owes
any compensation or remuneration to a Business Employee or any contractor of a
Seller Entity in relation to the Business Intellectual Property, including
with respect to any Patent that is based on an invention of, or copyright that
is based on a work of, any current or former employee, officer, director,
consultant or contractor of any Seller Entity. There is no Patent, Mark,
copyright, or other Intellectual Property rights included in the Business
Intellectual Property that is owned, exclusively licensed, or otherwise held
by a Business Employee or contractor of a Seller Entity or their Affiliates.

(g) All Patents included in the Business Intellectual Property have been
obtained in compliance with all legal requirements. No Patent included in the
Business Intellectual Property has in the three (3)-year period prior to the
date of this Agreement or is now involved in any interference, reissue,
reexamination or opposition proceeding in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
or any corresponding office, department, organization, agency or other
Governmental Entity elsewhere, and no such action has been threatened. No
Patent included in the Business Intellectual Property is subject to any
compulsory license. To the Knowledge of Seller, the Patents included in the
Business Intellectual Property are valid and enforceable.

(h) The Business Contracts, when acquired and assumed by Purchaser and the
Purchaser Entities at the Closing, will not by their terms cause or require
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to (A) grant to any other Person any
license, covenant not to sue, immunity or other right with respect to or under
any of Purchaser's or its Affiliates' Intellectual Property, or (B) be
obligated to pay any royalties or other amounts, or offer any discounts, to
any other Person with respect to Purchaser's products and services.

Section 3.9 Real Property. Except as set forth in Section 3.9 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules, as of immediately prior to the transfer of title to the
OATS Facility described in Section 5.18, the applicable Seller Entities will
have good and valid title in fee to the OATS Facility, free and clear of all
Liens, other than Permitted Liens and Liens that would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the Business. There are no written or oral
subleases, licenses, concessions, occupancy agreements or other contractual
obligations granting to any other Person the right of use or occupancy of the
OATS Facility and there is no Person (other than Seller) in possession of the
OATS Facility. The current use of the OATS Facility is, in all material
respects, in accordance with the certificates of occupancy relating thereto
and the terms of any Permits relating thereto. Except as would not reasonably
be expected to be material to the Business, the OATS Facility and its current
use, occupancy and operation by Seller and the structural facilities located
thereon do not (a)



constitute a nonconforming use or structure under, and are not in breach or
violation of, or default under, any applicable building, zoning, subdivision
or other land use or similar Law, or (b) otherwise violate or conflict with
any covenants, conditions, restrictions or other contractual obligations,
including the requirements of any applicable Lien thereto. There is no pending
or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened condemnation Action that would
preclude or materially impair the use of the OATS Facility. The OATS Facility
is in good condition and repair and is sufficient for the operation of the
Business as conducted thereon in all material respects. As of the date hereof,
neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries have received within the two
(2)-year period prior to the date of this Agreement written notice of any
material default under any restrictive covenants affecting the OATS Facility,
and there has not occurred any event that with the lapse of time or the giving
of notice or both would constitute such a material default under any such
restrictive covenants. There are no outstanding options or rights of first
refusal to purchase the OATS Facility or any portion thereof or interest
therein. There is no pending construction on the OATS Facility. Except as set
forth in Section 3.9 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, there are no service
contracts or other agreements relating to the use or operation of the OATS
Facility.

Entity or any other information supplied by such party to, or correspondence
with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement, the Transaction
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and Section 5.3 of this Agreement, each party shall
promptly inform the other party, and if in writing, furnish the other party
with copies of (or, in the case of material oral communications, advise the
other party orally of) any communication from any Governmental Entity
regarding the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and permit the other party to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any
proposed written (or any material proposed oral) communication with any such
Governmental Entity. If either party or any Representative of such party
receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Transaction or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then such party will use best efforts to make,

Entity, gives Seller the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.
Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and Section 5.3, each party shall

furnish the other party with such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of filings or submissions of information to any such Governmental
Entity. Purchaser and Seller may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other under this Section 5.1 as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel
and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or
directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance
from the source of the materials (Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be) or
its legal counsel; provided, however, that materials provided pursuant to this
Section 5.1(b) may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the
valuation of or future plans for the Business, (ii) as necessary to comply
with contractual obligations, and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable
privilege concerns.



(f) Each of Purchaser and Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby, including using reasonable best efforts to
take all such further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections,
if any, as any Governmental Entity or any other person may assert under any
Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event
no later than the Outside Date); provided, that Purchaser shall proffer to, or
agree to make any material changes (including through a licensing arrangement)
or restriction on, or other impairment of Purchaser's ability to own or
operate, any assets, licenses, product lines, businesses or interests therein
with respect to the business of Purchaser; provided, however, that Purchaser
shall not be obligated to, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to
require Purchaser to, (i) proffer to, or agree to, sell, divest, lease,
transfer, dispose of or otherwise hold separate and agree to sell, divest,
transfer, or dispose of, before or after the Closing, any assets, licenses,
operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interests therein of the
Business or Purchaser (or to consent to any sale, divestiture, lease,
transfer, or disposition by Seller of any of assets of the Business or to any
agreement by any such person to take any of the foregoing actions) or (ii)
proffer to, or agree to, license the right to manufacture, design, or modify
HomeLink Technology (including HomeLink Technology that is integrated into
another product or system).

(g) Purchaser and the other Purchaser Entities agree to provide such security
and assurances as to financial capability, resources and creditworthiness as
may be reasonably requested by any Governmental Entity or other third party
whose Approval is sought in connection with the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Whether or not the Transaction is
consummated, Purchaser shall be responsible for all HSR Act filing fees and
expenses to any Governmental Entity in order to obtain any Approvals pursuant
to this Section 5.1.

(h) Any provision in this Agreement notwithstanding, none of Seller, the other
Seller Entities or any of their respective Affiliates shall under any
circumstance be required to pay or commit to pay any amount or incur any
obligation in favor of or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or
otherwise, regardless of any provision to the contrary in the underlying
Contract, including any requirements for the securing or posting of any bonds,
letters of credit or similar instruments, or the furnishing of any guarantees)
to any Person to obtain any Approval (other than de minimis fees or nominal
filing or application fees). Assuming compliance by Seller with this Section
5.1, none of Seller, the other Seller Entities nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall have any Liability whatsoever to Purchaser arising out of or
relating to the failure to obtain any Approvals that may be required in
connection with the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or because of the termination of any Contract as a result
thereof. Purchaser acknowledges that no representation, warranty or covenant
(other than a breach of this Section 5.1) of Seller contained herein shall be
breached or deemed breached solely as a result of (i) the failure to obtain
any Approval, (ii) any such termination of a Contract, or (iii) any Proceeding
commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or
relating to the failure to obtain any such Approval or any such termination.

or

(xx) authorize any of, or commit or agree to take, whether in writing or
otherwise, or do any of, the foregoing actions.

(f) Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, the parties

limit the transfer of Excluded Assets prior to, at or after the Closing.

(g) Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, nothing in
this Section 5.2 shall prohibit or otherwise restrict in any way the operation
of the business of Seller,



the other Seller Entities or their respective Affiliates, except solely with
respect to the conduct of the Business by Seller, the other Seller Entities
and their respective Affiliates.

Section 5.3 Confidentiality. (f) Purchaser acknowledges that the information
being provided to it in connection with the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated hereby is subject to the terms of that certain
confidentiality agreement between Purchaser and Seller, dated as of March 12,
2013 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the terms of which are incorporated
herein by reference in their entirety and shall, subject to the following
sentence, survive the Closing; provided, that actions taken by the parties
hereunder to the extent necessary in order to comply with their respective
obligations under Section 5.1 hereunder shall not be deemed to be in violation
of this Section 5.3 or the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that
the foregoing shall not affect Section 5.1(b) to the extent that Section
5.1(b) specifies that it is subject to this Section 5.3 or the Confidentiality
Agreement. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate with respect to information relating solely to the
Business or the Purchased Assets; provided, however, that Purchaser
acknowledges that its obligations of confidentiality and non-disclosure with
respect to any and all other information provided to it by or on behalf of
Seller, the other Seller Entities or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives, concerning Seller, the other Seller Entities or any of their
respective Affiliates (other than solely with respect to the Business or the
Purchased Assets) shall continue to remain subject to the terms and conditions
of the Confidentiality Agreement (but subject to the term therein), any
termination of the Confidentiality Agreement that has or would otherwise occur
notwithstanding.

(g) Seller hereby agrees with Purchaser that it shall not, and shall not
permit its Affiliates or their respective Representatives and agents to, at
any time on or after the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, without the
prior written consent of Purchaser, disclose to any third party (other than
Seller's Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives) or use any
confidential or proprietary information included in the Purchased Assets
("Confidential Business Information"); provided, however, that the term
"Confidential Business Information" will not include any information (i) that
becomes available to Seller or its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives from and after the Closing, from a third party source that is
not known by Seller to be under any obligations of confidentiality in respect
of such information, (ii) that is or becomes generally available to, or known
by, the public (other than as a result of disclosure in violation hereof),
(iii) that is or was derived independently by Seller, its Affiliates or any of
their respective Representatives without use of Confidential Business
Information. In addition, the foregoing shall not prohibit Seller, its
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives (A) from using
Confidential Business Information for the purpose of complying with the terms
of any of the Transaction Documents or any Contract that has not been assigned
or transferred pursuant to Section 2.14, or (B) disclosing Confidential
Business Information that Seller, any of its Affiliates or its or their
Representatives are required by Law (by oral questions, interrogatories,
requests for information, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar
process) to disclose (provided that Seller will, to the extent not legally
prohibited, provide Purchaser with prompt written notice of such request so
that Purchaser may seek, at its sole expense, an appropriate protective order
and/or waive compliance with this Section 5.3(b)). Furthermore, the provisions
of this Section 5.3(b) will not prohibit any retention of copies of records or
any disclosure in connection with the preparation and filing of financial
statements and Tax returns of Seller or its Affiliates or any



disclosure made in connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy
relating to this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that Seller, the Seller Entities and their respective Affiliates
currently, and may continue following the Closing, to maintain business and
commercial relationships (whether as a customer, supplier or otherwise) with
the same Persons and engage in commercial relationships with such Persons and
with Purchaser and the other Purchaser Entities, and may employ, or continue
to employ, individuals who previously worked in or with the Business and
possess knowledge and Know-How used in relating to, or arising from the
Business, to maintain or expand such relationships, and agree that nothing in
this Section 5.3(b) shall prohibit or restrict the maintenance or expansion of
any such relationships or employment of any such individuals.

(h) Seller will instruct, or cause its Representatives to instruct, each third
party that entered into a nondisclosure agreement in connection with the
Automotive Electronics Sale Process to return or destroy any confidential
materials to the extent related to the Business that such third party received
from Seller, its Affiliates or Representatives and that constitute "Evaluation
Materials" (as defined in the nondisclosure agreement between Seller and such
third party). Seller will promptly notify Purchaser if any such third party
fails to respond or upon becoming aware that the third party refuses to comply
with Seller's or its Representative's request to return or destroy such
confidential materials.

Section 5.4 Access to Information. (e) Seller shall afford to Purchaser and
its Representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable notice during normal
business hours, consistent with applicable Law and in accordance with
reasonable procedures established by Seller, during the period prior to the
Closing, to the properties, books, Contracts, records and personnel of Seller
and its Subsidiaries related to the Business; provided, however, that (i)
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to violate any
obligation of confidentiality to which it or any of its Affiliates may be
subject in discharging their obligations pursuant to this Section 5.4(a); (ii)
Seller shall make available, or cause its Subsidiaries to make available,
Business Employee personnel files only after the Closing Date (provided that
Seller shall not make, or cause to be made, available medical records, workers
compensation records or the results of any drug testing; and (iii) prior to
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not conduct any Phase II Environmental Site
Assessment or conduct any invasive testing or any sampling of soil, sediment,
surface water, ground water or building material at, on, under or within any
property of Seller, the Seller Entities, or any of their respective
Affiliates.

(f) Purchaser agrees that any investigation undertaken pursuant to the access
granted under Section 5.4(a) shall be conducted in such a manner as not to
unreasonably interfere with the operation of the Business, and none of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Representatives shall communicate with
any of the employees of the Business without the prior written consent of
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to provide access to or
disclose information where, upon the advice of counsel, such access or
disclosure would jeopardize attorney-client privilege or contravene any Laws.

(g) Except with respect to Tax Returns and other information relating to Taxes
(which shall be governed by Section 6.1), at and after the Closing, Purchaser
shall, and shall cause



its Affiliates to, afford Seller, its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives, during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice,
consistent with applicable Law and in accordance with the procedures
established by Purchaser or its Affiliates, as applicable, reasonable access
to the properties, books, Contracts, records and employees of the Business to
the extent that such access may be reasonably requested by Seller, including
in connection with financial statements, taxes, reporting obligations and
compliance with applicable Laws; provided, however, that nothing in this
Agreement shall limit any of Seller's or any of its Affiliates' rights of
discovery.

(h) Purchaser agrees to hold all the books and records of the Business
existing on the Closing Date and not to destroy or dispose of any thereof for
a period of ten (10) years from the Closing Date or such longer time as may be
required by Law, and thereafter, if it desires to destroy or dispose of such
books and records, to offer first in writing at least sixty (60) days prior to
such destruction or disposition to surrender them to Seller.

Section 5.5 Publicity. The initial press release with respect to the
Transaction shall be a joint press release, and has been agreed upon by Seller
and Purchaser. Other than such joint press release, from the date of this
Agreement until the Closing, no party to this Agreement nor any Affiliate or
Representative of such party shall issue or cause the publication of any press
release or public announcement in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by Law or stock exchange
rules.

Section 5.6 Employee Matters. (i) Continuation of Employment. As of the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall either (i) continue to employ each Business
Employee who remains employed by Seller or any Affiliate as of such date
(each, a "Current Business Employee"), to the extent employment continues by
operation of Law, or (ii) except as otherwise provided in Section 5.6(f),
offer, or cause its applicable Affiliate to offer, employment to such Current
Business Employee, to the extent employment does not continue by operation of
law, in all cases, on terms consistent with this Section 5.6. Each Current
Business Employee whose employment continues by operation of Law and each
Current Business Employee who accepts Purchaser's offer of employment pursuant
to this Section 5.6(a) (or pursuant to Section 5.6(f)) shall be referred to
herein as a "Transferred Business Employee." Except as otherwise expressly set
forth herein, from and after the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates shall
retain all Liabilities under the Benefit Plans, and all other Liabilities
related to Business Employees who do not become Transferred Business
Employees.

(j) Terms and Conditions of Employment. With respect to each Transferred
Business Employee who remains so employed with Purchaser, Purchaser shall, for
a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing (the "Transition
Period"), provide each Transferred Business Employee who remains so employed
with Purchaser compensation and benefits that are, in the aggregate,
substantially similar to those in effect for such Transferred Business
Employee as of immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. As of and
after the Closing, Purchaser shall provide to each Transferred Business
Employee full credit for all purposes under each Purchaser Benefit Plan for
such Transferred Business Employee's service prior to the Closing with Seller
or any of its Affiliates, to the same extent such service is recognized by
Seller and its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing; provided that such
service shall not be recognized where such



recognition would result in duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of service and further provided that such service shall not be credited
for purposes of eligibility or benefit accrual under any defined benefit
pension plan or for purposes of eligibility or benefit accrual under any post-
employment medical benefits.

(k) Health Coverages. Purchaser shall make available to each Transferred
Employee and his or her eligible dependents coverage under group health
Purchaser Benefit Plans that (i) do not limit or exclude coverage on the basis
of any pre-existing condition of any Transferred Business Employee or
dependent (other than any limitation already in effect under the applicable
group health Benefit Plan) or on the basis of any other exclusion or waiting
period not in effect under the applicable group health Benefit Plan, and (ii)
provide each Transferred Business Employee full credit under the applicable
group health Purchaser Benefit Plans for the applicable plan year in which the
Closing Date occurs, for any deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket expenses
already incurred by the Transferred Business Employee under the applicable
group health Benefit Plan in satisfying any deductible, co-payment or out-of-
pocket expenses under the applicable group health Purchaser Benefit Plans.
Seller shall retain all Liabilities for medical, prescription drug, dental,
vision or other welfare benefit expenses for each Transferred Business
Employee with respect to claims incurred prior to the Closing Date, with a
claim deemed incurred at the time professional services, equipment or
prescription drugs covered by the applicable plan are obtained.

(l) Severance. If, during the Transition Period, Purchaser or an applicable
Affiliate of Purchaser terminates without Cause the employment of any
Transferred Business Employee (other than as a result of such Transferred
Business Employee's death or disability) then Purchaser or an applicable
Affiliate of Purchaser shall, provided such Transferred Business Employee
signs and returns and does not a revoke a timely and effective general release
of claims in favor of Purchaser, its Affiliates and all related Persons in the
form provided by Purchaser or an applicable Affiliate of Purchaser, enter into
a separation agreement (such form of release and form of separation agreement
to be customary in content and form, and not to contain any restrictive
covenants other than (i) a bar on future claims associated with such release
and (ii) those to which such employee is already bound) with such Transferred
Business Employee pursuant to which the Transferred Business Employee shall be
eligible to receive a severance benefit equal to the greater of (i) the amount
of base salary or base wages the Transferred Business Employee would have
received if his or her employment had continued through the end of the
Transition Period and (ii) the severance benefits determined in accordance
with the policy set forth on Section 5.6(d) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules, taking into account such Transferred Business Employee's service
with Seller and its Affiliates prior to the Closing and with Purchaser and its
Affiliates on and after the Closing. The amount of such severance payment
shall be determined by reference to the base salary or base wage rate in
effect for such Transferred Business Employee as of immediately prior to the
date of this Agreement; provided, however, that the severance payment shall be
reduced by any other payments or benefits to which the Transferred Business
Employee is required to receive under applicable Law as a result of
termination of his or her employment, including any Law that provides for
statutory severance payments, notice periods or the like.



(m) Accrued Salary, Wages, Vacation, Sick Leave and Personal Time. Seller will
retain all Liabilities with respect to salary or wages, sick leave and
personal time accrued but unpaid as of the Closing (including any Liabilities
to Transferred Business Employees for payments in respect of earned but unpaid
salary or wages that arise as a result of the transfer of employment
contemplated by this Section 5.6). Purchaser will assume all Liabilities with
respect to vacation for all Transferred Business Employees accrued but unused
as of the Closing (including any Liabilities to Transferred Business Employees
for payments in respect of earned but unused vacation time that arise as a
result of the transfer of employment contemplated by this Section 5.6).
Section 5.6(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules sets forth, for each
employee who is expected to be a Transferred Business Employee, the amount of
vacation that has been accrued but unused as of the date of this Agreement;
provided, however, that as of the Closing, Seller shall provide Purchaser with
an updated version of Section 5.6(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules that
sets forth, for each Transferred Business Employee, the amount of vacation
that has been accrued but unused as of the Closing, which amount shall not
exceed the sum of (i) the number of vacation days shown on Section 5.6(e) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedules, plus (ii) the number of additional vacation
days accrued between the date of this Agreement and the Closing under Seller's
vacation policy in effect on the date of this Agreement. Seller shall promptly
(and, in any event, within ten (10) Business Days following the later of the
Closing Date and the date of the applicable payment) reimburse Purchaser or
its Affiliate, as applicable, for any payments made by Purchaser or its
Affiliates to any Transferred Business Employees in respect of earned but
unpaid salary or wages that become due as a result of the transfer of
employment contemplated by this Section 5.6. Purchaser shall promptly (and, in
any event, within ten (10) Business Days following the later of the Closing
Date and the date of the applicable payment) reimburse Seller or its
Affiliate, as applicable, for any payments made by Seller or its Affiliates to
any Transferred Business Employees in respect of any earned but unused
vacation time that become due as a result of the transfer of employment
contemplated by this Section 5.6. Purchaser shall allow Transferred Business
Employees to use the vacation time recognized or established in accordance
with the second sentence of this Section 5.6(e), without duplication, in
accordance with the terms of Purchaser's and its applicable Affiliates'
programs in effect as of the date of this Agreement (in addition to, and not
in lieu of, any vacation to be accrued under the applicable vacation plans or
policies of Purchaser or its Affiliates from and after the Closing).

(n) Disability Benefits. Seller shall retain all Liabilities for short- and
long-term disability with respect to claims incurred prior to the Closing
Date, with a claim deemed incurred at the time of the injury, sickness or
other event giving rise to the claim for such benefits. If any Business
Employee who is receiving short- or long-term disability benefits as of the
Closing Date is, within six (6) months following the Closing Date, able to
return to work, Purchaser shall offer employment to such employee on terms
consistent with those applicable to Transferred Business Employees generally
under this Section 5.6. Seller shall make available coverage under the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"),
to each eligible Business Employee who does not become a Transferred Business
Employee or who experiences a "qualifying event" (within the meaning of COBRA)
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(o) 401(k) Plan. Purchaser maintains a tax-qualified defined contribution plan
with a cash or deferred feature (the "Purchaser 401(k) Plan"). With respect to
each Transferred Business Employee who, as of immediately prior to the
Closing, was eligible to participate in a tax-qualified defined contribution
plan maintained by Seller or its Affiliates (collectively, the "Seller 401(k)
Plans"). Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Purchaser
401(k) Plan to accept any distribution (excluding loans) as a rollover
contribution from the Seller 401(k) Plans, if so directed by the Transferred
Business Employee.

(p) Annual Bonuses. Seller or its applicable Affiliate shall pay an annual
bonus for the year in which the Closing occurs prorated through the Closing
Date (which will be based on actual performance determinations made by Seller,
unless such determinations have not been made as of the time of payment, in
which case the amount will be based upon the applicable target level) to each
Transferred Business Employee who is or would be eligible to receive an annual
bonus under any Benefit Plan pursuant to the terms thereof.

(q) WARN Act Disclosure. On or before the Closing Date, Seller will provide to
Purchaser the number of employees located at each U.S. site owned or leased by
Seller or an Affiliate prior to the Closing where Transferred Business
Employees are anticipated to be located after the Closing, who have
experienced, or will experience, an employment loss or layoff (as defined in
the WARN Act or any comparable Law) within the 90 days prior to the Closing
Date, along with the date of the employment loss or layoff.

(r) Notice of Employee Termination. From and after the date of this Agreement
until the Closing, Seller shall notify Purchaser promptly in writing if any
Business Employee, who is an executive or key employee, provides a Seller
Entity with notice of termination of employment or, to the Knowledge of
Seller, otherwise discloses plans to terminate employment with the Business in
the next twelve (12) months.

(s) No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Without limiting the generality of Section
10.4, the provisions of this Section 5.6 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and no current or former employee, director or
independent contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and
nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Benefit Plan or other
employee benefit plan for any purpose. Furthermore, no provision of this
Agreement shall be construed as (i) requiring Purchaser to continue any
specific plans or continue the employment of any specific person or (ii)
prohibiting or limiting the ability of Purchaser or its Affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any plans, programs, policies, arrangements, agreements or
understandings of Purchaser or its Affiliates and nothing herein shall be
construed as an amendment to any such plan, program, policy, arrangement,
agreement or understanding for any purpose.

Section 5.7 Financial Obligations. At or prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall
at its sole expense (a) arrange for substitute letters of credit, surety
bonds, Purchaser guarantees and other obligations to replace the outstanding
letters of credit, surety bonds, guarantees and other contractual obligations
entered into by or on behalf of Seller, any Seller Entity or any of their
respective Affiliates in connection with or relating to the Business, the
Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities (together, the "Guarantees") or
(b) assume all obligations under each Guarantee, obtaining from



the creditor or other counterparty a full and irrevocable release of Seller
and its Affiliates that are liable, directly or indirectly, for reimbursement
to the creditor or fulfillment of other Liabilities to a counterparty in
connection with the Guarantees. Purchaser further agrees that to the extent
Seller or any of its Affiliates incur any cost or expense, or are required to
make any payment, in connection with such Guarantees on or after the Closing,
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates against,
and reimburse Seller and its Affiliates for, any and all amounts paid,
including costs or expenses in connection with such Guarantees, including
Seller's and any of their respective Affiliates' expenses in maintaining such
Guarantees, whether or not any such Guarantee is drawn upon or required to be
performed, and shall in any event promptly and in no event later than three
(3) Business Days after written demand therefor from Seller, reimburse Seller
and any of its Affiliates to the extent any Guarantee is called upon and
Seller or any of its Affiliates make any payment or incur any Liability in
respect of any such Guarantee. At the request of Seller, Purchaser shall
provide Seller or any of its Affiliates with letters of credit in an amount
equal to Seller's and any of its Affiliates' entire potential Liability in
respect of any such Guarantees.

Section 5.8 Names Following Closing. (a) Except for those trademarks and trade
names expressly assigned to Purchaser, neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall use, or have the right to use the JCI Name and JCI Marks or
any name or mark that, in the reasonable judgment of Seller, is similar to or
embodying the JCI Name and JCI Marks.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Closing, Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall have the right to use existing packaging, labeling,
containers, stationery, business forms, supplies, advertising and promotional
materials and any similar materials bearing the JCI Name and JCI Marks until
the date that is ninety (90) days following the Closing Date.

Section 5.9 Insurance. (a) Subject to Section 5.9(b), from and after the
Closing Date, the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, and
the operations and assets and Liabilities in respect thereof, shall cease to
be insured by Seller's or its Affiliates' insurance policies or by any of
their self-insured programs, and neither Purchaser nor its Affiliates
(including the Business) shall have any access, right, title or interest to or
in any such insurance policies (including to all claims and rights to make
claims and all rights to proceeds) to cover the Business, the Purchased
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, or the operations or assets or Liabilities in
respect thereof. Seller or its Affiliates may amend any insurance policies in
the manner it deems appropriate to give effect to this Section 5.9(a). From
and after the Closing, Purchaser shall be responsible for securing all
insurance it considers appropriate for the Business, the Purchased Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities, and the operations and assets and Liabilities in respect
thereof. Subject to Section 5.9(b), Purchaser further covenants and agrees not
to seek to assert or to exercise any rights or claims of, or in respect of,
the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, and the
operations and assets and Liabilities in respect thereof, under or in respect
of any past or current insurance policy under which any of the foregoing is a
named insured.

(c) Seller and its Affiliates will keep each of the workers compensation
insurance policies set forth on Section 5.9(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules ("Workers Compensation Policies"), or suitable replacements
therefor, in full force and effect through the Closing. Notwithstanding the
last sentence of Section 5.9(a), with respect to claims relating to acts,
omissions, events or circumstances relating to Business Employees that

to Section 5.12(b), the license granted in Section 5.16(b) will permit Seller
and its Affiliates to incorporate Business Products purchased from Purchaser
or its Affiliates into Retained Business Products.

(d) In the event that one or more third parties purchases or acquires (whether
by way of merger, asset acquisition, share exchange, consolidation, business

memorializing the terms set forth in this Section 5.16, including such
additional agreements or licenses as may be necessary or desirable to effect

Acquiring Party and its Affiliates as contemplated by Section 5.16(d).

Section 5.17 Further Assurances. From and after the Closing, each party shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates, as applicable, to, provide all cooperation
reasonably requested by the other party in order to effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction

and releases, and causing its Representatives to provide good faith testimony
by affidavit, declaration, and in person. Each party will reimburse the other
party for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the other party in
causing the other party's Representatives to provide the cooperation described

Affiliates and their respective Representatives to, refer all customer
inquiries relating to the Purchased Assets to Purchaser. In the event of a
sale of the Automotive Electronics Business (an "AEB Transaction"), the Seller
shall take actions so that the buyer of the Automotive Electronics Business
(the "AEB Buyer") acknowledges in writing that the Purchased Assets shall have
been sold to Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, which
acknowledgement will be evidenced by a provision in the purchase agreement (or
other written



agreement between Seller and the AEB Buyer) for the AEB Transaction that the
Purchased Assets shall not be included in the AEB Transaction.

Section 5.18 Real Estate Matters. (b) Seller agrees that it shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the transfer of the OATS Facility to
Purchaser, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens, with such
transfer to occur at the Closing or as promptly as practicable after the
Closing. Such actions shall include: (i) retaining a surveyor to assess a land
division (including by providing a drawing and legal description sufficient
for a land division application) and a permanent easement (which may take the
form of an easement revocable upon replacement by an alternate access pursuant
to Section 5.18(b)) for access to the OATS Facility from a public road; (ii)
filing an application for land division approval with the City of Holland
Assessor's office under the Michigan Land Division Act and local ordinances
pursuant thereto (the "Land Division Act"); and (c) timely responding to any
comments from the City of Holland's Assessor's office in an attempt to
effectuate such land division from the municipality. Purchaser agrees that it
shall use reasonable best efforts to assist Seller in this regard and shall
cooperate with Seller in responding to any comments described in clause (c) of
the previous sentence. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller, in its sole
discretion, subject to the requirements of the City of Holland, will determine
the size and configuration of the land to be conveyed along with the OATS
Facility, provided that the OATS Facility will be able to continue to be used
in a substantially similar fashion to the manner in which it is currently
used, and Purchaser shall have a vehicle access easement to the OATS Facility
along one of the paved roads currently accessing the Facility (which easement
may be revocable upon replacement by an alternate access pursuant to Section
5.18(b)), from a public right of way. Purchaser shall be responsible for all
fees and expenses paid or incurred by Seller in connection with the land
division (including filing fees and the cost of retaining the surveyor),
except fees of and payments to Seller's legal and professional advisors, which
shall be paid pursuant to Section 10.11. If the land division is not
effectuated prior to (and therefore clear title to the OATS Facility cannot be
transferred to Purchaser at) the Closing, each party shall continue to use its
reasonable best efforts after the Closing to effectuate the land division and
transfer of title to the OATS Facility free and clear of all Liens, other than
Permitted Liens, as soon as commercially practicable after the Closing, and
during any such time after Closing, Seller shall provide Purchaser with the
benefits and exclusive use of the OATS Facility, subject to such use as is
provided in Section 5.18(d) to Seller. Purchaser shall be solely responsible
for the costs and expenses (including tap fees, development fees and
application fees) of any required water or sewer tap-in or public dedication
of currently private water or sewer lines.

(b) At the time that Seller transfers title to the OATS Facility to Purchaser,
Seller shall also deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Purchaser: (i) a deed
in such form as would be sufficient in the applicable jurisdiction to convey
insurable fee simple title to the OATS Facility subject only to Permitted
Liens, together with any affidavits, forms, certificates and other documents
that are required for presentation or submission when transferring real
property or recording deeds in the jurisdiction where the OATS Facility is
located; and (ii) such customary affidavits, including a so-called gap
indemnity, as may be required by a title insurance company in order to issue
an owner's title insurance policy insuring Purchaser's fee simple interest in
the OATS Facility free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens. The
parties agree that Permitted Liens hereunder shall include (A) all approvals
and restrictions engendered under the Land Division Act, and (B) the terms of
the access easement to the OATS Facility from a public



right of way, which the parties agree may be provided by an easement over
Seller's or a third party's property and that Seller or such third party shall
have the right at any time to revoke same, provided the OATS Facility is
afforded alternate access to a public right of way in a manner that is
acceptable to the City of Holland's Assessor's office.

(c) If on or prior to Closing, in the case of the Seller Entities, or
following the Closing, in the case of the Purchaser Entities, one party remits
to the appropriate Taxing Authority a payment for Property Taxes with respect
to any Purchased Assets relating to a Straddle Period, and such payment
includes the other party's share of such Property Taxes (as determined in
accordance with the allocation set forth under the definition of "Excluded
Taxes"), such other party shall reimburse the remitting party for its share of
such Property Taxes within ten (10) Business Days following receipt of written
notice from the remitting party setting forth in reasonable detail the
calculation thereof (and accompanied by an invoice or such other reasonable
documentation evidencing the payment of such Property Taxes to the appropriate
Taxing Authority). The Purchaser Entities and their Affiliates shall not be
required to make a payment pursuant to this Section 5.18(c) with respect to
any Excluded Taxes, and the Seller Entities and their Affiliates shall not be
required to make a payment pursuant to this Section 5.18(c) with respect to
any Taxes other than Excluded Taxes.

(d) From and after the Closing, Purchaser will grant Seller or, following an
AEB Transaction, the AEB Buyer, reasonable access to the OATS Facility to
perform testing on products designed, manufactured, marketed or sold by the
Automotive Electronics Business on commercially reasonable terms. Seller or
AEB Buyer, as applicable, shall pay to Purchaser commercially reasonable fees
for the use of the OATS Facility to perform such testing.

Disclosure Schedules sets forth the registered Intellectual Property that
Seller believes as of the date hereof to be primarily related to the Business.

the signing of a definitive agreement between Seller and a third party Person
providing for an AEB Transaction (the "Schedule Update Period"), Seller shall
provide Purchaser with lists of registered Intellectual Property, Intellectual
Property license agreements and Mirror-Based Technology, in each case owned,
controlled or licensed by the Seller and its Affiliates that is primarily
related to the Business or Seller's Automotive Electronics Business and all
supporting records and materials as reasonably requested by Purchaser (the "IP
Materials"). During the Schedule Update Period, Seller and Purchaser shall use
reasonable best efforts to review the IP Materials to identify (i) registered
Intellectual Property that is primarily related to the Business and to update
Section 2.4(b)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules if necessary to reflect
such Intellectual Property, (ii) the Contracts primarily related to the
Business under which Intellectual Property is licensed to Seller or its
Affiliates and to update Section 2.4(a) and Section 2.4(b)(ii) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules if necessary to reflect such Contracts, and (iii)
Intellectual Property



that relates to Mirror-Based Technology to update Section 2.5(c) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules to reflect such Intellectual Property. During the
Schedule Update Period, Seller and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to
update Sections 2.4(a), 2.4(b)(i), 2.4(b)(ii) and 2.5(c) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules to reflect the registered Intellectual Property that is
primarily related to the Business, the Contracts primarily related to the
Business under which Intellectual Property is licensed to the Seller or its
Affiliates and Intellectual Property that relates to Mirror-Based Technology,
respectively.

Section 5.20 Tangible Personal Property Matters. Section 2.4(c) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule sets forth the Tangible Personal Property that Seller
believes as of the date hereof to be the Tangible Personal Property primarily
used, or held for use, by the Business. During the Schedule Update Period,
Seller and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to update Section 2.4(c) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedules to reflect Tangible Personal Property that is
primarily used, or held primarily for use, by the Business. If, following the
Closing, either party identifies any Tangible Personal Property primarily
used, or held primarily for use, by the Business that was not included in the
Purchased Assets, the Parties shall each designate one (1) individual to
negotiate in good faith to determine whether such Tangible Personal Property
should be transferred to the Purchaser Entities.

Section 5.21 Seller's Internal Reorganization. Seller, at its sole discretion,
may, and may cause certain of its Affiliates to, take all steps necessary to
effect and carry out a reorganization substantially as described in Section
5.21 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules (the "Alternative Structure
Reorganization"), provided, that Seller shall deliver written notice to
Purchaser of its decision to effect the Alternative Structure Reorganization
as soon as practicable after Seller makes such decision and in any event at
least ten (10) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date. In
addition, Seller may, and may cause certain of its Affiliates to, enter into
any other pre-Closing reorganization with respect to any of the Seller
Entities, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Business (a
"Proposed Reorganization"); provided, that (i) Seller shall keep Purchaser
reasonably apprised of, and give Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to
evaluate and comment on, any Proposed Reorganization prior to effecting such
Proposed Reorganization, (ii) such Proposed Reorganization shall not, in any
event, result in Purchaser acquiring any legal entities at the Closing and
(iii) Seller shall not effect such Proposed Reorganization without the prior
written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). For the avoidance of doubt and without
limitations, Purchaser's consent shall not be considered to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed to the extent the Proposed Reorganization
would reasonably be expected to result in increased costs (including for Tax)
to any of the Purchaser Entities or any of their Affiliates in connection with
the Transaction or otherwise in any Post-Closing Period.

ARTICLE VI 
CERTAIN TAX MATTERS

Section 6.1 Cooperation and Exchange of Information. Each party to this
Agreement shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide to the other party
to this Agreement such cooperation, documentation and information relating to
the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and/or the Business as either of
them reasonably may request in (i) filing any Tax Return, amended Tax



Return or claim for refund, (ii) determining a Liability for Taxes or a right
to refund of Taxes, (iii) conducting any Tax Proceeding, or (iv) the Mexican
Purchaser obtaining "maquiladora" status for Mexican Tax purposes. Each party
shall make its employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis
at its cost to provide an explanation of any documents or information so
provided. The requesting party shall be responsible for and hold the other
party and its Affiliates harmless against any reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by such other party (and/or its Affiliates) in connection
with any request made pursuant to this Section 6.1.

Section 6.2 Transfer Taxes. Except as specifically provided in Section 6.3
with respect to Mexican VAT and as specifically provided in Section 6.4 with
respect to German VAT, Purchaser and Seller shall each pay, when due, and be
responsible for fifty percent (50%) of, any sales, use, transfer (including
real estate transfer), documentary, stamp, or similar Taxes and related fees
imposed on or payable in connection purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets
and the Business pursuant to this Agreement ("Transfer Taxes"). The party
responsible under applicable Law for filing the Tax Returns with respect to
such Transfer Taxes shall prepare and timely file such Tax Returns and
promptly provide a copy of such Tax Return to the other party. Seller and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate to
timely prepare and file any Tax Returns or other filings relating to such
Transfer Taxes, including any claim for exemption or exclusion from the
application or imposition of any Transfer Taxes.

Section 6.3 Mexican VAT.

(i) No later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall deliver a written notice (specifying that such notice is being delivered
pursuant to this Section 6.3(a)) (i) identifying in reasonable detail which
Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities held by the applicable Seller Entity
in Mexico should be transferred to the Purchaser outside of Mexico (such
assets, the "Mexican Exported Assets", and, the purchase of the Mexican
Exported Assets by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, the "Mexican Exported
Assets Purchase") and (ii) confirming that Purchaser intends to treat the
Mexican Exported Assets Purchase as an export sale under Mexican VAT Laws
subject to a zero percent (0%) Mexican VAT rate. Seller shall cause the
relevant Seller Entity to (1) deliver to Purchaser a valid VAT invoice (such
valid invoice, the "Mexican Exported VAT Receipt") with respect to the Mexican
Exported Assets Purchase, which Mexican Exported VAT Receipt shall be prepared
in a manner consistent with the Allocation Principles and shall reflect a zero
Mexican VAT amount due based on a zero percent (0%) Mexican VAT rate, and (2)
any other documentation reasonably required under applicable Law to establish
the status of the Mexican Exported Asset Purchase as an export sale for
purposes of applicable Mexican Tax Law (provided that Seller (or its
applicable Affiliate) is legally permitted to deliver such documentation).
Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, take any position
on any Tax Return (except to the extent otherwise required as a result of the
resolution of a Tax audit or similar Tax Proceeding in accordance with the
immediately succeeding sentence or any other Tax Proceeding) or otherwise take
any action, in each case, inconsistent with the treatment of the Mexican
Exported Assets Purchase as an export sale under Mexican VAT Laws unless
Seller has previously notified Purchaser in writing that Mexican VAT has been
assessed on Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Mexican
Exported Assets Purchase and that Seller does not intend to challenge such
assessment. If the treatment of the Mexican Exported Asset Purchase as an
export sale under Mexican VAT Laws is subject to a challenge by any Taxing
Authority in



connection with a Tax audit or any similar Tax Proceeding against Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates, the provisions of Section 6.5 (other than Section
6.5(g)) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, with respect to such Tax audit or
similar Tax Proceeding.

(j) With respect to the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities held by
the applicable Seller Entity in Mexico and to be transferred pursuant to this
Agreement to the Mexican Purchaser, which Purchased Assets and Assumed
Liabilities shall be identified in reasonable detail by Purchaser in writing
in a notice (specifying that such notice is being delivered pursuant to this
Section 6.3(b)) to be delivered to Seller no later than ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date (the "Mexican Purchased Assets" and, the purchase of
the Mexican Purchased Assets by the Mexican Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement, the "Mexican Purchased Assets Purchase"), Seller shall cause the
relevant Seller Entity to (i) deliver to the Mexican Purchaser a valid VAT
invoice (such valid invoice, the "Mexican Purchased VAT Receipt") with respect
to the Mexican Purchased Assets Purchase, which Mexican Purchased VAT Receipt
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Allocation Principles and
applicable Mexican VAT Law. The parties intend, based on their understanding
of current Mexican VAT Laws, that a zero percent (0%) Mexican VAT rate would
apply to the Mexican Purchased Assets Purchase if the Mexican Purchaser
obtains "maquiladora" status for Mexican Tax purposes.

(k) Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.3(d), if any portion of the sale
and purchase of the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities pursuant to
this Agreement is subject to Mexican VAT (such Mexican VAT, the "Mexican VAT
Amount"), the relevant Seller Entity shall remit such Mexican VAT Amount to
the Mexican Taxing Authority and issue to Purchaser a Mexican VAT receipt
reflecting such assessed Mexican VAT Amount. With respect to any Mexican VAT
Amount imposed with respect to the Mexican Exported Assets Purchase, (i)
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly recover from the
Mexican Taxing Authority such Mexican VAT Amount (whether as a refund or as a
credit)and (iii) to the extent Purchaser so recovers such Mexican VAT Amount
(or any portion thereof) as a refund or as credit against Taxes otherwise due,
Purchaser shall promptly pay over to Seller the amount of such recovered
Mexican VAT Amount, net of fifty percent (50%) of any reasonable out of pocket
fees and expenses incurred by Purchaser in seeking such recovery.

(l) Subject to the delivery of the Mexican Purchased VAT Receipt, Purchaser
shall pay, or shall cause the Mexican Purchaser to pay, to the applicable
Seller Entity any Mexican VAT Amount imposed with respect to the Mexican
Purchased Assets Purchase no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the due
date for the remittance of such Mexican VAT Amount by the applicable Seller
Entity to the applicable Taxing Authorities. The Seller shall inform the
Purchaser upon Closing in writing as to the due date for the remittance of
such Mexican VAT Amount to the applicable Taxing Authorities. For the
avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall be entitled to retain any refund or credit
in respect of the Mexican VAT Amount paid by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates to the applicable Seller Entity pursuant to this Section 6.3(d).

Section 6.4 German VAT. Seller, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates
intend to report the sale of the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities held
by the applicable Seller Entity in Germany to be transferred pursuant to this
Agreement to the German Purchaser (the "German Purchased Assets," and, the
purchase of the German Purchased Assets by the German Purchaser



pursuant to this Agreement, the "German Assets Purchase") as subject to German
VAT. Seller shall cause the relevant Seller Entity to deliver to the German
Purchaser a valid VAT invoice (such valid invoice, the "German Purchased VAT
Receipt") with respect to the German Asset Purchase, which German Purchased
VAT Receipt shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Allocation
Principles and shall set forth the amount of German VAT (the "German VAT
Amount") due based on the German VAT rate(s) applicable to the German Assets
Purchase. Seller shall inform the Purchaser upon Closing in writing as to the
due date for the remittance of such German VAT Amount to the applicable Taxing
Authorities. Subject to the delivery of the German Purchased VAT Receipt,
Purchaser shall pay, or shall cause an Affiliate thereof to pay, to the
applicable Seller Entity, on behalf of the German Purchaser, the German VAT
Amount no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the due date for the
remittance of such German VAT Amount by the applicable Seller Entity to the
applicable Taxing Authorities. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall be entitled to retain any refund or credit in respect of the
German VAT Amount paid by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to the applicable
Seller Entity pursuant to this Section 6.4.

Section 6.5 Tax Proceedings Relating to Successor Liability. In the event of
any Tax Proceedings relating to a claim by any Tax Authority against Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates for a material amount of Excluded Taxes (provided
such claim is based on a theory of successor or transferee liability or
similar Law (including any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer Laws)),
Purchaser shall be entitled to control, at its sole expense, such Tax
Proceeding, provided, that (a) Purchaser shall provide Seller with a timely
and reasonably detailed account of each significant development with respect
to such Tax Proceeding, (b) Purchaser shall consult with Seller before taking
any significant action in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (c) Purchaser
shall consult with Seller and offer Seller an opportunity to comment before
submitting any written materials prepared or furnished in connection with such
Tax Proceeding, (d) Purchaser shall defend such Tax Proceeding diligently and
in good faith as if it was the only party in interest in connection with such
Tax Proceeding, (e) Seller shall be entitled to receive copies of any written
materials relating to such Tax Proceeding received from the relevant Tax
Authority, (f) Purchaser shall afford Seller (at Seller's own expense) a
reasonable opportunity to participate in such Tax proceedings with its own
counsel (including attending any meetings and, to the extent possible,
participating in any telephone calls with the relevant Tax Authority), and (g)
Purchaser shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceedings
without the Seller's prior written consent unless such consent is unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

Section 6.6 Certain Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser shall pay or shall cause an Affiliate
thereof to pay, be responsible for and indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any incremental amount of
deduction or withholding required under any applicable Tax Law with respect to
any amounts payable hereunder by the Purchaser Entities or any of their
assignees to the extent such incremental amount of deduction or withholding
arises out of or results from an assignment by any of the Purchaser Entities
or any of their assignees of all or any portion of their rights under this
Agreement (or delegation by any of the Purchaser Entities or any of their
assignees of all or any portion of its obligations under this Agreement)
pursuant to Section 10.2 (including any such deduction or withholding
applicable to (or additional Taxes imposed with respect to) additional sums
payable by Purchaser, German Purchaser or their assignees pursuant to this

6.4 (the "VAT Treatment"), except to the extent otherwise required as a result
of the resolution of a Tax audit or similar Tax Proceeding in accordance with
the immediately succeeding sentence or any other Tax Proceeding. If the VAT
Treatment is subject to a challenge by any Taxing Authority in connection with
a Tax audit or similar Tax Proceeding, Seller or Purchaser, as the case may
be, shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, in good faith and
using commercially reasonable efforts, defend such VAT Treatment against such
challenge; provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that none of Seller,
Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates shall be required to appeal,
petition or take any similar action with respect to any decision made upon a
Tax audit or any other Tax Proceeding).

ARTICLE VIII 
TERMINATION; EFFECT OF TERMINATION



Section 8.1 Termination. Anything to the contrary in this Agreement
notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and the Transaction and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement abandoned at any time prior

(d) by mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

(e) by Seller, if any of Purchaser's representations and warranties contained
in Article IV of this Agreement shall fail to be true and correct or Purchaser
shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its

for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties' Covered Losses under this Section 9.2(b)(i); and (B) Section
9.2(a)(i) (other than any Covered Loss resulting from a breach of the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Section 3.19(a)), until

under Section 9.2(a)(i) (other than any Covered Losses resulting from a breach

exceeds $10,500,000 (the "Deductible"), after which Seller shall be obligated
for all the Purchaser Indemnified Parties' Covered Losses under Section

Section 9.2(b)(ii) and Section 9.2(b)(iii);

Section 9.4 Procedures. (h) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified
under this Agreement (the "Indemnified Party") shall promptly notify the party
or parties liable for such indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") in
writing of any pending or threatened claim or demand that the Indemnified
Party has determined has given or would reasonably be expected to give rise to
such right of indemnification (including a pending or threatened claim or
demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party, such claim
being a "Third Party Claim"), describing in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances, to the extent then known by the Indemnified Party, with respect
to the subject matter of such claim or demand; provided that neither the
failure to provide such notice nor any deficiency in such notice shall release
the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article IX
except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such
failure, it being agreed that notices for claims in respect of a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement must be delivered prior to the
expiration of any applicable survival period specified in Section 9.1 for such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.



(i) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.3(a), the
Indemnifying Party will be entitled, by notice to the Indemnified Party
delivered within twenty (20) Business Days of the receipt of notice of such
Third Party Claim stating that the Indemnifying Party will assume the defense
and control of such Third Party Claim (at the expense of such Indemnifying
Party) and hold harmless the Indemnified Party from and against the entirety
of any and all Covered Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from,
arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third Party
Claim; provided that, if the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense and, in
the course of defending such Third Party Claim, (x) the Indemnifying Party
discovers that the facts presented at the time the Indemnifying Party
acknowledged its indemnification obligation in respect of such Third Party
Claim were not true and (y) such untruth provides a reasonable basis for
asserting that the Indemnifying Party does not have an indemnification
obligation in respect of such Third Party Claim, then (A) the Indemnifying
Party shall not be bound by such acknowledgment, (B) the Indemnifying Party
shall promptly thereafter provide the Indemnified Party written notice of its
assertion that it does not have an indemnification obligation in respect of
such Third Party Claim and (C) the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding an election to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to employ separate co-counsel and to participate in the defense as
counsel of record, if applicable, in such action or proceeding (and the
parties shall jointly control the defense), and the Indemnifying Party shall
bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i)
there exists an actual or potential conflict of interest between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of
the Third Party Claim that would make representation by the same counsel or
the counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party inappropriate, (ii) such Third
Party Claim seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party or (iii) such Third Party Claim relates to or otherwise
arises in connection with any criminal or regulatory enforcement Action. In
any other event not set forth in the previous sentence, the Indemnifying Party
shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own
expense. In any event, the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party and their
counsel shall cooperate in the defense of any Third Party Claim subject to
this Article IX and keep such Persons informed of all developments relating to
any such Third Party Claims, and provide copies of all relevant correspondence
and documentation relating thereto. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume
the defense and control of any Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section
9.4(b), the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume and control such
defense, but the Indemnifying Party may nonetheless participate in the defense
of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense.
Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates and Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in the defense of any Third Party Claim, including by furnishing books
and records, personnel and witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of such
Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense and
control of a Third Party Claim, it shall not be authorized to consent to a
settlement or compromise of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any
Third Party Claim without the consent of any Indemnified Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless, (i) the Indemnified
Party is given a full and complete release of any and all Liability by all
relevant parties to such claim or demand, (ii) the damages payable under the
settlement are limited only to monetary payments for which the Indemnified
Party is fully indemnified by the



Indemnifying Party and (iii) such Third Party Claim does not involve any
injunctive relief or finding or admission of any violation of Law or admission
of any wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party. No Indemnified Party will consent
to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with
respect to a Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party. In the event that the Indemnified Party conducts the
defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 9.4(b) (whether as
sole, lead or co-counsel), the Indemnifying Party will remain responsible for
any and all Covered Losses that the Indemnifying Party may incur or suffer
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of or caused by the
Third Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in this Article IX.

(j) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Section 9.4
shall not apply with respect to any Tax Proceedings or any other claim related
to Taxes or Tax Returns.

Section 9.5 Exclusive Remedy and Release. Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and
agree that, following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of Section
9.2, Section 9.3 and the specific performance provisions of Section 10.6 shall
be the sole and exclusive remedies of Seller and Purchaser, respectively, for
any Covered Losses (including any Covered Losses from claims for breach of
contract, warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and
whether predicated on common law, statute, strict liability, or otherwise,
except claims for fraud) that each party may at any time suffer or incur, or
become subject to, as a result of or in connection with this Agreement, the
Transaction or the other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, including
any breach of any representation or warranty in this Agreement by any party,
or any failure by any party to perform or comply with any covenant or
agreement that, by its terms, was to have been performed, or complied with,
under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waive any
right of rescission they may otherwise have or to which they may become
entitled.

Section 9.6 Additional Indemnification Provisions. With respect to each
indemnification obligation contained in this Agreement, the amount of Covered
Losses shall calculated net of any third-party insurance or indemnity,
contribution or similar proceeds that have been recovered by the Indemnified
Party in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification
(it being agreed that if third-party insurance or indemnification,
contribution or similar proceeds in respect of such facts are recovered by the
Indemnified Party subsequent to the Indemnifying Party's making of an
indemnification payment in satisfaction of its applicable indemnification
obligation, such proceeds shall be promptly remitted to the Indemnifying Party
to the extent of the indemnification payment made), and the Indemnified Party
shall use, and cause its Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts to
seek full recovery under all insurance and indemnity, contribution or similar
provisions covering such Covered Loss to the same extent as it would if such
Covered Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. Upon making any
payment to the Indemnified Party for any indemnification claim pursuant to
this Article IX, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of
such payment, to any rights which the Indemnified Party may have against any
third parties with respect to the subject matter underlying such
indemnification claim, and the Indemnified Party shall assign any such rights
to the Indemnifying Party. The amount of Covered Losses shall be calculated
without any adjustment for Tax benefits to the Indemnified Party. If a payment
for a Covered Loss has been made pursuant to this Article IX and the
Indemnified



Party actually receives (including through a reduction in Taxes otherwise paid
or required to be paid) a net Tax benefit (calculated on a "with and without"
basis and taking into account the intended Tax treatment of indemnification
payments under this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.9, any reduction in
Tax attributes of the Indemnified Party, including depreciable and/or
amortizable Tax basis and any costs and out of pocket expenses incurred in
connection with the realization and receipt of such Tax benefit) with respect
to the corresponding Covered Loss in the Tax year in which the Covered Loss is
suffered or the next succeeding Tax year, the Indemnified Party shall pay to
the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to such net Tax benefit actually
received; provided, that the Indemnified Party shall not be obligated, in any
event, to pay to the Indemnifying Party more than the amount of the
corresponding payment made by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party
with respect to the applicable Covered Loss.

Section 9.7 Limitation on Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement (including this Article IX), neither party shall
be liable to the other party or its Affiliates, whether in contract, tort
(including negligence and strict liability) or otherwise, at law or in equity,
and "Covered Losses" shall not include any amounts for any consequential,
special, incidental, indirect, punitive or similar damages whatsoever
(including lost profits, diminution of value, or damages calculated on
multiples of earnings or other metrics approaches), except (i) to the extent
awarded against an Indemnified Party in connection with a Third Party Claim or
(ii) arising out of or related to the Specified Litigation Liabilities.

Section 9.8 Mitigation. Except with respect to Taxes and Tax Returns, each of
the parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its
respective Covered Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or
condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Covered Losses
that are indemnifiable hereunder.

ARTICLE X

understanding among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter

Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, to a



wholly owned Subsidiary without Seller's consent and (y) may grant a security
interest and/or a collateral assignment to its lenders of its respective
rights and benefits arising under this Agreement; provided, that no such
assignment or delegation or grant of a security interest will release
Purchaser from any of its Liabilities or obligations hereunder.

hand, may waive compliance by the other with any term or provision of this
Agreement that the other party was or is obligated to comply with or perform.
Such waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with such term or
provision shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure of compliance.

9.3, which are intended to benefit, and to be enforceable by, the parties

Section 10.6 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform any provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and
agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled in Law or in equity. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has
an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with such order or
injunction.

Section 10.7 Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed
by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Michigan, without regard to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Michigan or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Michigan. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) submits to the exclusive
personal jurisdiction of the Third (3rd) Circuit Court of the State of
Michigan, County of Wayne, or the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Michigan located in Detroit, Michigan, in the event any dispute
(whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arises out of this Agreement or the
Transaction or



the other transactions contemplated hereby; (b) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court; (c) agrees that it will not bring any
Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Transaction or the other
transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the Third (3rd)
Circuit Court of the State of Michigan, County of Wayne, or the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan located in Detroit,
Michigan; and (d) agrees that it will not seek to assert by way of motion, as
a defense or otherwise, that any such Proceeding (i) is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) should be transferred or removed to any court other
than one of the above-named courts, (iii) should be stayed by reason of the
pendency of some other proceeding in any court other than one of the above-
named court, or (iv) that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not
be enforced in or by the above-named courts. Each party agrees that service of
process upon such party in any such Proceeding shall be effective if notice is
given in accordance with Section 10.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this
Section 10.7, a party may commence any Action in any court other than the
above-named courts solely for the purpose of enforcing an order or judgment
issued by one of the above-named courts relating to any dispute (whether in
contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of this Agreement or the Transaction
or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 10.8 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT WAIVES TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY OF THEM
AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT,
OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE ADMINISTRATION
THEREOF OR THE TRANSACTION OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREIN OR THEREIN. NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL SEEK A JURY TRIAL IN ANY
LAWSUIT, PROCEEDING, COUNTERCLAIM OR ANY OTHER LITIGATION PROCEDURE BASED
UPON, OR ARISING OUT OF, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY RELATED INSTRUMENTS. NO PARTY
WILL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED
WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED.
EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT OR INSTRUMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE IN THIS SECTION 10.8. NO PARTY HAS IN ANY WAY
AGREED WITH OR REPRESENTED TO ANY OTHER PARTY THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
SECTION 10.8 WILL NOT BE FULLY ENFORCED IN ALL INSTANCES.

Section 10.9 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority
to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.



Section 10.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument,
and shall become effective when one or more such counterparts have been signed
by each party and delivered (by facsimile, e-mail, or otherwise) to the other
party. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by
electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf") from, or by any other
electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial
appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of
the paper document bearing the original signatures. This Agreement has been
executed in the English language. If this Agreement is translated into another
language, the English language text shall in any event prevail.

Section 10.11 Expenses. Whether or not the Closing takes place, and except as
set forth otherwise in this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the Transaction and the other transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall pay the reasonable, documented
fees and expenses of Purchaser incurred in connection with seeking Regulatory
Approval under the Antitrust Laws of Mexico, provided that such fees and
expenses to be paid by Seller will not exceed $50,000 in the aggregate.

Section 10.12 Interpretation; Absence of Presumption. It is understood and
agreed that the specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any
specific item in the Seller Disclosure Schedules or Purchaser Disclosure
Schedules is not intended to imply that such amounts or higher or lower
amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are not material, and
no party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the
inclusion of any such item in the Seller Disclosure Schedules or Purchaser
Disclosure Schedules in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described in this Agreement or
included in the Seller Disclosure Schedules or Purchaser Disclosure Schedules
is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Nothing herein
(including the Seller Disclosure Schedules or the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedules) shall be deemed an admission by either party or any of its
Affiliates, in any Proceeding or Action, that such party or any such
Affiliate, or any third party, is or is not in breach or violation of, or in
default in, the performance or observance of any term or provisions of any

and drafting of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and if an
ambiguity or question of interpretation should arise, this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
parties thereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
burdening either party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions in
this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents; (k) a reference to any
Person includes such Person's successors and permitted assigns; (l) any
reference to "days" means calendar days unless Business Days are expressly
specified; (m) reference to a document being "made available" shall mean such
