Section 1.1 _The Merger_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, the Company and Merger
Sub shall consummate the Merger pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, (ii) the Company shall be the surviving

date as Parent and the Company may agree) with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware and shall make all other filings or recordings required
under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time such Certificate
of Merger shall have been duly filed with, and accepted by, the Secretary of

Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws and
applicable Laws.

ARTICLE II

 

MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OF STOCK

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Company Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or Merger
Sub or any holder of any securities thereof:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub,
par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, par
value $0.01 per share.

 



-2-  (b) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each outstanding or issued Share that is owned
by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or by any Subsidiary of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company, immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the
" _Excluded Shares_ "), shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and no cash, stock or other consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares)
shall automatically be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount,
without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration. As of the Effective
Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (a "
_Certificate_ ") or book-entry Shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") representing
any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares,
except, in all cases, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest, upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with _Section 2.2_. The right of any holder of any Share to
receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount
of any withholding that is required under applicable Tax Law. 

(d) _Company Stock Awards_. The Company shall take all requisite action so
that:

 

(i) At the Effective Time, each outstanding incentive or nonqualified option
to purchase Shares (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") or portion thereof
under the drugstore.com, inc., 1998 Stock Plan, as amended, and the
drugstore.com, inc., 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (individually, a "
_Company Equity Plan_ " and collectively, the " _Company Equity Plans_ ")
that is vested immediately prior to the Effective Time by its terms as they
exist on the date hereof and without any action on or after the date hereof by
the Company Board or any committee thereof (other than as permitted by
Section 5.1, as provided in the last sentence of this Section 2.1(d)(i), as
provided in Schedule 5.1 or with the written consent of Parent) or vests by
its terms as they exist on the date hereof and without any action on or after
the date hereof by the Company Board or any committee thereof (other than as
permitted by Section 5.1, as provided in the last sentence of this Section
2.1(d)(i), contemplated by Schedule 5.1 or with the written consent
of Parent) as a result of the occurrence of the Merger and has an exercise
price per Share that is less than the Merger Consideration (each, a " _Vested
In-the-Money Company Option_ "), shall without any action on the part of the
holder of such option, automatically be cancelled and exchanged for a cash
payment by Parent (which shall be made promptly after the Effective Time) in
an amount equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration
over (y) the exercise price per Share subject to such Vested In-the-Money
Company Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares subject to such Vested
In-the-Money Company Option. Any such payments shall be subject to applicable
Tax withholdings. All Company Stock Options held by non-employee members of
the Companys board of directors shall vest and become exercisable in full
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option (or portion thereof)
under the Company Equity Plans that is not a Vested In-the-Money Company
Option (each, an " _Other_  

 



-3-    _Company Option_ "), shall be converted into an option (a " _Substitute
Option_ ") to purchase the number of shares of common stock of Parent
(decreased to the nearest full share or as otherwise required to satisfy the
requirements of Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder) determined by multiplying (A) the number
of Shares covered by such Other Company Option, by (B) the Equity Award
Ratio, and the exercise price per share of such Substitute Option shall be
determined by dividing the exercise price per Share of such Other Company
Option by the Equity Award Ratio (increased to the nearest cent). After the
Effective Time, except as provided in this _Section 2.1(d)_, each Substitute
Option shall be exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to the Other Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, subject to any acceleration, lapse or other vesting occurring by
operation of the Merger (either alone or in connection with any other event).
It is the intention of the parties that each Substitute Option so assumed by
Parent shall qualify following the Effective Time as an incentive stock
option as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent permitted under
Section 422 of the Code and to the extent such Substitute Option qualified as
an incentive stock option prior to the Effective Time, and, further, that the
assumption of Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section shall be effected
in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Sections 409A and 424(a) of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and this Section
2.1(d) will be construed consistent with this intent.

(iii) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Share of restricted stock
issued under any Company Equity Plan (each, a " _Restricted Share_ ") whether
or not then vested, shall without any action on the part of the holder of such
Restricted Share, automatically be cancelled and exchanged for a cash payment
by Parent (which shall be made promptly after the Effective Time) in an amount
equal to the Merger Consideration. Any such payments shall be subject to
applicable Tax withholdings.

 

(iv) At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit issued
under any Company Equity Plan (each, a " _Restricted Stock Unit_ "), shall be
adjusted and converted into a restricted stock unit (each, a " _Substitute
RSU_ ") with respect to a number of shares of the common stock of Parent
(decreased to the nearest full share) determined by multiplying the number of
Shares subject to such Restricted Stock Unit by the Equity Award Ratio. After
the Effective Time, except as provided in this _Section 2.1(d)_, each
Substitute RSU shall be subject to the terms of such Restricted Stock Unit
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to any payment,
calculation, acceleration, lapse, vesting or other impact occurring by
operation of the Merger (either alone or in connection with any other
event);  _provided_ , _however_ , that any Restricted Stock Unit that becomes
vested prior to or as a result of the Merger shall be settled at the Effective
Time (or such later time as required by the applicable Restricted Stock Unit
agreement or as necessary to avoid a violation and/or adverse tax
consequences under Section 409A of the Code) for an amount of cash equal to
the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of Shares subject to
such Restricted Stock Unit, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
_Section 2.1(c)._

(v) At the Effective Time, each outstanding stock appreciation right issued
under any Company Equity Plan (each, a " _Stock Appreciation Right_ ") or
portion thereof that is vested immediately prior to the Effective Time by its
terms as they exist on the date hereof and without any action on or after
the date hereof by the Company Board or any committee thereof (other

 



-4-   than as permitted by Section 5.1, as provided in Schedule 5.1 or with the
written consent of Parent) or vests by its terms as they exist on the date
hereof and without any action on or after the date hereof by the Company
Board or any committee thereof (other than as permitted by Section 5.1, as
provided in Schedule 5.1 or with the written consent of Parent) as a result of
the occurrence of the Merger and has an exercise price per Share that is less
than the Merger Consideration (each, a " _Vested In-the-Money Company SAR_ "),
shall without any action on the part of the holder of such Stock Appreciation
Right, automatically be cancelled and exchanged for a cash payment by Parent
(which shall be made promptly after the Effective Time) in an amount equal to
(i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise
price per Share subject to such Vested In-the-Money Company SAR, multiplied
by (ii) the number of Shares subject to such Vested In-the-Money Company SAR.
Any such payments shall be subject to applicable Tax withholdings.

(vi) At the Effective Time, each Stock Appreciation Right (or portion thereof)
that is not a Vested In-the-Money Company SAR (each, an " _Other Company SAR_
"), shall be converted into an appreciation right (each, a " _Substitute
Right_ ") to purchase the number of shares of common stock of Parent
(decreased to the nearest full share or as otherwise required to satisfy the
requirements of Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder) determined by multiplying (A) the number
of Shares covered by such Other Company SAR, by (B) the Equity Award Ratio,
and the exercise price per share of such Substitute Right shall be determined
by dividing the exercise price per Share of such Other Company SAR by the
Equity Award Ratio (increased to the nearest cent). After the Effective Time,
except as provided in this _Section 2.1(d)_, each Substitute Right shall be
exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the Other
Company SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to any
acceleration, lapse or other vesting occurring by operation of the Merger
(either alone or in connection with any other event). It is the intention of
the parties that the assumption of Stock Appreciation Rights pursuant to this
Section shall be effected in a manner that satisfies the requirements of
Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, and this Section 2.1(d) will be construed consistent with this
intent.

 

(e) _Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding warrant to purchase
Shares (each " _Company Warrant_ ") shall be automatically converted into the
right to receive an amount equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the exercise price of each such Company Warrant
multiplied by (y) the number of unexercised Shares subject thereto (such
payment, if any, to be net of applicable withholding Taxes) (the " _Warrant
Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all such Company Warrants shall be
cancelled and shall represent only the right to receive the Warrant
Consideration.

Section 2.2 _Disposition of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank
or trust company to act as Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the
payment of the Merger Consideration. Parent will enter into a paying agent
agreement with the Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ ") on terms
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company, prior to the Effective Time.
Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying
Agent for payment in accordance with _Section 2.1_ the aggregate Merger
Consideration, 

 



-5-   (such total deposited cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment
Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall make payments of the Merger Consideration,
out of the Payment Fund in accordance with this Agreement and the Paying
Agent Agreement. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b)  _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
representing ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such Shares except
as otherwise provided for herein. From and after the Effective Time, any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Paying Agent or, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation for any reason (other than Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares representing Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

(c) _Payment Procedures_. As soon as possible after the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares
(other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) (A) a letter of transmittal
in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass to
the Paying Agent, only upon delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
to the Paying Agent) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled. Upon surrender of any
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount
of the Merger Consideration in cash payable in respect of the Shares
previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article II_ , and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable.

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund which
remains undistributed for twelve months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, and any holders of Shares prior to the Effective Time who
have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ and the instructions in
the letter of transmittal shall thereafter look only to Parent and only as
general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws).

 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company or the Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or
Affiliate thereof, shall

 



-6-   be liable to any Person in respect of the Merger Consideration or Warrant
Consideration, as applicable, from the Payment Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

(f) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Payment Fund as directed by the Surviving Corporation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Payment Fund shall not be invested in any
manner that would preclude, limit or delay the Paying Agent from timely making
all payments contemplated by this _Article II_. Any net profit resulting
from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to
Parent. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments,
or the Payment Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to
make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby,
Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Payment Fund lost
through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is,
at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by Parent
or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
and customary amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

 

(i) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Such holders
shall be entitled to receive such consideration as is determined to be due
with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under the
Appraisal Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid such consideration
as is determined to be due pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and
such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to
receive, the Merger Consideration, without interest and reduced by the amount
of any withholding that is required under applicable Tax Law. The Company
shall promptly deliver to Parent notice of any demands received by the Company
for appraisal of any Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate
in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not without the prior written consent of Parent make any
payment with respect to, or offer to settle any such demands.

similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally or by

held, has approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger), which approval, to the extent applicable,
constituted approval under the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, as a
result of

 



-12-   which this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Merger), are not and will not be subject to the restrictions on
business combinations under the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL. The
Company Stockholder Approval is the only vote of the holders of any class or
series of capital stock or other securities of the Company required under
applicable Law, Contract or otherwise to approve the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(b) As of the date hereof, the Company Board, at a meeting duly called and
held, has unanimously approved and declared advisable and in the best

resolved to recommend that the Companys stockholders adopt this Agreement
and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby in

which resolutions, as of the date hereof, have not been rescinded, modified
or withdrawn in any way except, if applicable, to the extent permitted by

would become a default), or result in a right of payment or loss of a benefit
under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, amendment
or acceleration of, any Contract (as defined in Section 3.17(c) hereof) to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets or
properties are bound, (iv) except as set forth in Section 3.13 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, result in any breach or violation of any Company Plan

expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company,
and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby,
do not and will not require any consent, approval, order, license,
authorization or permit of, action by, filing, registration or declaration
with or notification to, any governmental or regulatory (including stock
exchange) authority, agency, court, commission or other governmental body
(each, a " _Governmental Entity_ "), except for (i) such filings as required
under applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") (and the rules and

 



-13-   regulations promulgated thereunder) and under state securities and "blue
sky" Laws, (ii) the filings required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ ") and any filings

permits, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations, notices and
filings the absence of which, individually and in the aggregate, have not had,
and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.5 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The Company has filed or furnished all forms, reports, statements,
schedules, certifications and other documents (including all exhibits,
amendments and supplements thereto) required to be filed or furnished by it
with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ")
since December 31, 2007 (all such forms, reports, statements, schedules,
certificates and other documents filed or furnished since December 31, 2007,
collectively, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates,
or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment filed prior to the
date hereof, each of the Company SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), the Exchange Act and SOX (as defined in 
_Section 3.5(d)_ hereof), and the applicable rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, as the case may be, each as in effect on the date so
filed. Except to the extent that information in any Company SEC Document has
been revised or superseded by a Company SEC Document filed prior to the date
hereof, none of the Company SEC Documents contained, at the time of filing,
any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact
required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary of the Company is subject
to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act or is or has been
otherwise required to file any form, report, statement, schedule, certificate
or other document with the SEC, any foreign Governmental Entity that performs
a similar function to that of the SEC or any securities exchange or quotation
system.

(b) The audited consolidated financial statements of the Company (including
any related notes thereto) that are included in the Company SEC Documents (i)
comply as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC applicable thereto, (ii) have been prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and (iii) fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and
its Subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows for the periods indicated.

(c) The Company (i) maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" and
"internal control over financial reporting" (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), 

 



-14-   respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation, to the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee
of the Company Board (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
in the design or operation of such internal controls over financial reporting
that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys
internal controls over financial reporting. The Companys "disclosure controls
and procedures" are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by
the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information
is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer of
the Company required under the Exchange Act and SOX with respect to such
reports. The Companys management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX for the fiscal year
ended January 2, 2010, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. The Companys system of "internal controls over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is
reasonably sufficient in all material respects to provide reasonable assurance
(1) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in conformity GAAP, (2) that receipts and expenditures
are executed in accordance with the authorization of management, and (3)
regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of the Companys assets that would have a material effect on
the Companys financial statements. No significant deficiency, material
weakness or fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees was identified in managements assessment of internal controls for
the fiscal year ended January 2, 2011 (nor has any such deficiency, weakness
or fraud been identified after that date).

(d) The then-acting Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Accounting Officer
of the Company have signed, and the Company has furnished to the SEC, all
certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (" _SOX_ ") and the
statements contained in such certifications are accurate; such certifications
contain no qualifications or exceptions to the matters certified therein and
have not been modified or withdrawn; and neither the Company nor any of its
officers has received notice from any Governmental Entity questioning or

such Intellectual Property Agreement, or to exercise or decline to exercise
any option or right thereunder.

 

(c) _Protection of Intellectual Property_. The Company and its Subsidiaries
have all taken steps, which are, as a whole, not less protective and
comprehensive than the steps that would be taken by reasonably prudent
business persons operating in the Companys industry, to protect, preserve and
maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of their confidential and
proprietary information and data, except as, individually and in the
aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, causing each director, officer, employee and independent
contractor of the Company or of any Subsidiary thereof who has contributed to
the creation or development of any material Company-Owned IP to execute and
deliver to the Company (or a Subsidiary thereof if employed by such
Subsidiary) a confidentiality agreement substantially in the form of one of
the Companys form agreements previously made available to Parent. Except as
individually and in the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each director, officer,
employee and independent contractor of the Company or of any Subsidiary
thereof who has contributed to the creation or development of any material
Company-Owned IP has executed and delivered to the Company (or a Subsidiary
thereof, if employed by such Subsidiary) such an agreement. No current or
former director, officer, employee, consultant or contractor of Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company has any right, license, claim, moral right (other
than inalienable moral rights that arise under applicable law) or interest in
or with respect to material Company-Owned IP, except for any such right,
license, claim, moral right, or interest that could not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

delivery nor performance of this Agreement nor the consummation of the

to a right of termination of or to cause the loss of, any of the Companys or
its Subsidiaries rights in any material Company IP, including any rights
under any Intellectual Property Agreement or (ii) impair the right of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to exploit any Company-Owned IP. To the knowledge
of the Company, no current or former director, officer, employee or
independent contractor of the Company or of any Subsidiary thereof is using or

any third Person in connection with performing any services for the Company
or for any Subsidiary thereof or the development or creation of any Company-
Owned IP without the permission of the Company and such third Person.

(e) _Infringement Upon Company Intellectual Property_. To the knowledge of the
Company, except as set forth in Section 3.20(e) of the Company Disclosure

third Person of any Company-Owned IP other than immaterial uses, disclosures,
infringements or violations. Except as set forth in Section 3.20(e) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, since December 31, 2007, neither the Company nor

threatened Action by a third Person contesting the right of the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof with respect to any such third Persons Intellectual
Property or as currently conducted, or contesting the ownership by the
Company or any Subsidiary thereof of any Intellectual Property or the validity
or enforceability of any Intellectual Property and (ii) there are no such
actions pending, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Section
3.20(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter, since December 31, 2007, neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary thereof has received any notice or claim regarding
any offer to license such third Persons Intellectual Property alleged in such
notice or claim to be used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without
authorization, infringed, violated or misappropriated by the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof, or otherwise alleging any infringement, misappropriation,
or violation of any Intellectual Property owned by a third Person by the
Company, or any Subsidiary thereof. To the knowledge of the Company, the
exploitation of the Intellectual Property used by Company and its Subsidiaries
in the conduct of the business, in each case as previously conducted and as
currently conducted, do not infringe, violate or misappropriate any
Intellectual Property owned by any third Person.

(g) _Open Source Software_. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary thereof
has used, copied, incorporated or otherwise exploited any Open Source Software
in such a way that creates or purports to create obligations of the Company or
any Subsidiary thereof with respect to any Company-Owned IP (other than such
Open Source Software and modifications thereto) or grants or purports to
grant to any third Person on or before the Closing any rights or immunities
under any Company-Owned IP (other than such Open Source Software). " _Open
Source_

form, (ii) be licensed for the purposes of preparing derivative works, or
(iii) be licensed under terms that allow such other software to be reverse
engineered (other than by operation of law).

(h) _Privacy_. The privacy statement addressing the collection, retention, use
and distribution of the personally identifiable information of individuals
visiting the websites of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof (the " _Privacy
Statement_ ") is posted and accessible to individuals on each website of the

operation of their business (i) comply in all material respects with the
Privacy Statements applicable to any given set of personally identifiable
information collected by the Company or any Subsidiary thereof; (ii) comply
in all material respects with all applicable privacy Laws regarding the
collection, retention, use and disclosure of personally identifiable

Subsidiaries have taken measures to protect and maintain the confidential
nature of the personally identifiable information provided to the Company or
any Subsidiary thereof by individuals and to personal information collected
from individuals against loss, theft and unauthorized access or disclosure,
which measures are, as a whole, not less protective and comprehensive than
those that would be taken by reasonably prudent business persons operating in
the Companys industry. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary thereof has
received any claims, notices or complaints regarding the Companys or any of
its Subsidiaries information practices or the disclosure, retention, or
misuse if any personally identifiable information by the Federal Trade
Commission, any similar foreign bodies, or any similar Governmental Entity
that, if adversely determined, would result in a Material Adverse Effect.

or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

the representations set forth in _Section 4.9_, the approval by the Company
Board referred to in _Section 3.3_ constitutes the approval of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, for purposes
of the DGCL, and no further action is required by the Company Board (or any

to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement the restrictions on a "business combination" with an "interested

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.3_, if at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company

(after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to take the
actions referred to in _clause (x)_ or _(y)_ of this _Section 5.3(c)_ would

stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, then, prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may (x) furnish and make
available information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to
an Acceptable Confidentiality

 



-41-   Agreement (as defined in _Section 5.3(i)(i)_ hereof); _provided_ , that any

the Merger or take any action (or permit or authorize the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives to take any
action) inconsistent with the Company Recommendation or Company Determination
or resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions (each of such actions
set forth in this _Section 5.3(d)(i)_ being referred to herein as an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (ii) adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or
otherwise declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal or resolve, agree or
propose to take any such actions, (iii) cause or permit the Company to enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in

venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement related to an
Acquisition Proposal other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in
accordance with _Section 5.3(c)_ (each, an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ "), (iv) take any action to make the provisions of any Takeover
Laws or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, inapplicable to

under, Section 203 of the DGCL) or amend or modify or terminate, or grant any
waiver or release under, any confidentiality agreement with respect to an

class of equity securities of the Acquired Companies or fail to enforce
any provision thereof or (v) resolve, agree or propose to take any such
actions.

(e) Notwithstanding  _Section 5.3(d)_, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law (the " _Initial Fiduciary
Determination_ "), then, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
the Company Board may solely in response to a Superior Proposal that is
capable of being accepted by the Company (or, in the case of a tender offer or
exchange offer, recommended by the Company

 



-42-   Board or any committee thereof) and that was received on or after the date
hereof that has not been withdrawn or abandoned and that did not otherwise
result from a breach of  _Section 5.3(a), 5.3(b)_ or the first sentence of
_Section 5.3(c)_, make an Adverse Recommendation Change and thereafter or
concurrently therewith, terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section
7.1(d)(ii)_ (including payment of the Termination Fee, as defined in _Section
7.3(c)(ii)_) and take any other action that would be prohibited by _Section
5.3(d)_, including enter into a binding definitive agreement to effect such
Superior Proposal. Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall
make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(d)(ii)_, take any other action that would be prohibited by 
_Section 5.3(d)_ or cause the Company to enter into a binding definitive
agreement to effect such Superior Proposal unless the Company has first
complied with the provisions of _Section 5.3(f)_ and, after so complying,
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law and such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal.

(f) The Company Board shall not take any action set forth in _Section
5.3(e)_ unless the Company has first (i) provided written notice to Parent (a
" _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") advising Parent that the Company has
received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal, identifying the Person making such Superior Proposal
and providing copies of any agreements intended to effect such Superior
Proposal, and notifying Parent that the Company Board has made the
Initial Fiduciary Determination in accordance with _Section 5.3(e)_
(including the basis on which such determination has been made), (ii)
negotiated, and caused the Company and its Representatives to negotiate,
during the five (5) Business Day period following Parents receipt of the
Notice of Superior Proposal (the " _Notice Period_ "), in good faith with
Parent to enable Parent to make a counteroffer or propose to amend the terms
of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a
Superior Proposal, and (iii) after complying with _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ ,
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and
financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal after giving effect to any counter offer or amendments to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in writing that are capable of
being accepted by the Company and, after consultation with outside counsel,
that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change and terminate this
Agreement to accept such Superior Proposal would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that if during the Notice
Period any revisions are made to an Acquisition Proposal and such revisions
are material (it being understood and agreed that any change to consideration
with respect to such proposal is material), the Company shall deliver a new
Notice of Superior Proposal to Parent and shall comply with the requirements
of this _Section 5.3(f)_ with respect to such new Notice of
Superior Proposal (except that each new period after the initial five
Business Day period expires shall be three Business Days rather than five).

(g) The Company agrees that it shall take all actions necessary so that any
Adverse Recommendation Change shall not change the approval of this Agreement
or any other approval of the Company Board or any committee thereof with
respect to this Agreement that would have the effect of causing any of the
Takeover Laws of any state (including Delaware) or other similar statutes to
be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

 



-43-  (h) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company Board
from taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Item 1012(a) of

Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall be permitted to recommend that

Company Board effects an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with
_Section 5.3(e)_; _provided_ , _further_ that if any such disclosure relates
to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act), it shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly reaffirms the

substantially all of the assets of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, on terms which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of

the Company;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, without limiting in any way the

permitted the Representative to take such action or any similar action (in
which case, this proviso will not apply to such action or inaction).

 

Section 5.4 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall prepare and, no later than April 7, 2011, file with the SEC a proxy
statement in preliminary form relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting
(the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The Company will cause the Proxy Statement to
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Exchange Act and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to stockholders of the Company as soon as reasonably
practicable after (i) if the Company does not receive comments from the
SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement and does not reasonably
believe that it will receive comments, promptly following the tenth calendar
day immediately following the date of filing of the preliminary Proxy
Statement with the SEC and (ii) if the Company does receive comments from the
SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement, clearance by the SEC with
respect to such comments. Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with the
Company in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement, including,
but not limited to, furnishing to the Company any and all information
regarding Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates as may be
reasonably appropriate or required to be disclosed therein as promptly as
possible after the date hereof. The parties shall notify each other promptly
of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the 

 



-45-   Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall supply each other
with copies of all correspondence between such or any of its representatives,
on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to
the Proxy Statement or the Merger.

(b) The Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and its respective
Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or
its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of
mailing to stockholders and at the time of the meeting of stockholders of the
Company to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If, at any time
prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, any event occurs with
respect to the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent or Merger Sub, or any
change occurs with respect to other information to be included in the Proxy
Statement, which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Proxy Statement, the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, shall promptly notify the other party of such event and the Company shall
promptly file, with Parents cooperation, any necessary amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement. The Company will also advise Parent,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Proxy Statement.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall (i) provide Parent
an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response, (ii)
include in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by
Parent and (iii) not file or mail such document, or respond to the SEC, prior
to receiving the approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(d) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of the holders of Shares (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the
purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval. The notice of such
Company Stockholders Meeting shall state that a resolution to adopt this
Agreement will be considered at the Company Stockholders Meeting. Subject to
_Section 5.3(e)_, (x) the Company Board shall make the Company Recommendation
and shall include the Company Recommendation and the Company Determination in
the Proxy Statement and (y) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to solicit the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall not include in
the Proxy Statement any proposal to vote upon or consider any Acquisition
Proposal (other than the Merger). Except as provided herein, the Company shall
not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior
written consent of Parent. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence, the Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting
if (i) on the date which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the
Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares
to conduct business at the meeting or to obtain Company Stockholder Approval,
whether or not a quorum is present, (ii) the Company is required to postpone
or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting by applicable Law or (iii) the
Company is negotiating with a third party with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal in accordance with _Section 5.3_ and has delivered or reasonably
expects that it will deliver a Notice 

 



-46-   of Superior Proposal or the Company Stockholders Meeting is reasonably
expected to occur during, or within two (2) Business Days following, a Notice
Period; provided, however, that the Company shall consult with Parent prior
to making such adjournment or postponement and shall make such adjournment or
postponement for the minimum amount of time (A) that Parent and the Company
reasonably believe is necessary to obtain such proxies in the case of _clause
(i) _above, (B) as is required by Law in the case of _clause (ii)_ above or
(C) as the Company Board determines in good faith is necessary to allow it to
comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law or is necessary so that the Company Stockholders Meeting will
not occur during the Notice Period. The Company shall adjourn or postpone the
Company Stockholders Meeting at the request of Parent for up to ten (10)
Business Days if an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in _Section 7.3(c)_) has
been publicly made or disclosed or has become known to the stockholders of the
Company (other than the Companys officers and directors) and has not been
withdrawn or the Company has delivered a Notice of Superior Proposal and the
Company Stockholders Meeting would reasonably be expected to occur within ten
(10) Business Days after the expiration of the Notice Period;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such adjournment or postponement would result in the
Company Stockholders Meeting occurring less than 5 Business Days prior to the
Outside Date, then the Company shall only be required to adjourn or
postpone the meeting to a date 5 Business Days prior to the Outside Date.

Section 5.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, upon reasonable prior notice, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries, officers, directors to and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its Representatives to, afford to Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours, consistent with applicable Law, to the Companys and its Subsidiaries,
officers, employees, properties, offices, other facilities and books and
records, and shall furnish Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives with all financial, operating and other data and information
as Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives shall reasonably
request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or consultation
shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any
access to the property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall comply
with the Companys reasonable security requirements. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required
to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would (i) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other privilege held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise violate applicable Law, provided that the
Company has used its reasonable best efforts to provide such access or
disclose such information in a manner that does not result in such a waiver or
violation.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will hold and treat and will cause its
Representatives to hold and treat in confidence all documents and information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to Parent or Merger Sub
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with the Non-Disclosure Agreement between the Company and Parent
dated as of November 17, 2010 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and
remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms, except that as
of the date hereof

 



-47-   and until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to remove Section
3 thereof (it being understood and agreed that the remainder of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms and that following the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, the full Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect, notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent provided
therein).

Section 5.6 _Further Action; Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and no party hereto shall fail to use reasonable best efforts to take or
cause to be taken any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent,
impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
consents with respect to the Contracts listed on Section 3.4 of the Company
Disclosure Letter to the extent Parent requests that such consent be sought.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent
or Merger Sub to, and the Company shall not without the prior written consent
of Parent, agree to any modification to or accommodation under any Contract or
undertake any liability in connection with obtaining any consent under any
Contract. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party
hereto agrees to make, if required, appropriate filings under any Antitrust
Law (as defined in _Section 5.6(d)_ hereof), including an appropriate filing
of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event
within ten Business Days of the date hereof and to supply as promptly as
reasonably practicable and advisable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to use
reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable, including by requesting early termination of the waiting period
provided for in the HSR Act. The Company shall use good faith efforts to
execute its existing plan to become compliant with applicable Payment Card
Industry standards within a reasonable period of time.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in _Section
5.6(a)_ to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Law, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all
respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the other party reasonably informed
of any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to,
the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the
DOJ (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") or any other U.S. or foreign Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction and of any communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) permit the other party a
reasonable opportunity to review any substantive written communication given
by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any scheduled substantive
meeting or conference with, the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction or, in

 



-48-   connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person,
and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the Antitrust Division or such other
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction or other Person, give the other
party the reasonable opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings
and conferences. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and Parent may, as
each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other side under this _Section 5.6(b)_ as
"Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel regarding
Antitrust Law of the recipient and will not be disclosed by outside counsel to
employees, officers, directors or consultants of the recipient or any of its
Affiliates unless express permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials (the Company or Parent, as the case may be) or its
legal counsel. Each of the Company and Parent shall cause its respective
counsel regarding Antitrust Law to comply with this _Section 5.6(b)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.6(b)_, materials
provided to the other party or its counsel may be redacted to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company and privileged
communications.

 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and the
Company shall, from the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, use
their respective reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment that would restrain,
prevent or delay the Closing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, in order to obtain the approvals and authorizations for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Law, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall
be obligated to, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall be in sole
discretion of Parent), (i) proffer to, agree to or become subject to any
order, judgment or decree to, sell, license or dispose of or hold separate or
sell, license or dispose of or hold separate before or after the Closing, any
of the assets, businesses, product lines or interest in any assets or
businesses of Parent or any of its Affiliates or any material portion of the
assets, business product lines or interest in any assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or to consent to any sale, license, or disposition, or
agreement to sell, license or dispose of, by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, any material portion of the assets, businesses or product
lines of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) proffer to, agree to, or
become subject to any order, judgment or decree to make or accept, any
changes, modifications, limitations or restrictions in the operations of any
assets or businesses of Parent or any material portion of the assets or
businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (provided that Parent
need not agree to any such items with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries if any of such changes, modifications, limitations or
restrictions have any effect on the operations, business or assets of Parent
or any of its other Subsidiaries that would be material (with materiality
based on the size of the Company and its Subsidiaries rather than the size of
Parent and its Subsidiaries)), any Contract to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound or any Material Contract to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound or any
of the relationships of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any material
relationship of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any other Persons
(contractual or otherwise), or (iii) proffer to or agree to any concession,
accommodation or liability (except as would not be prohibited by clause (i)
and (ii)) (the items in _clauses (i)_ through _(iii)_ , to the extent related
to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby in order to obtain the approvals and authorizations for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust 

 



-49-   Law, including the filings made in connection with this _Section 5.6_, each
a " _Burdensome Action_ "). The parties understand and agree that the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall not take, offer or agree to any of the actions
described in _clauses (i)_ through _(iii)_ above (for purposes of this
sentence reading such clauses without the references to material) unless
Parent has provided its prior written consent, which consent shall be granted
with respect to any actions that are required to be taken pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement within a time period that would permit the Merger to
be consummated prior to the Outside Date if all of the other conditions to
the parties obligations are satisfied or waived (other than conditions that
may only be satisfied on the Closing Date).

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Antitrust Law_ " means the Sherman Act,
as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, Foreign Antitrust Laws and all other Laws that
are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of
competition through merger or acquisition.

 

Section 5.7 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

(a) Following the Effective Time, except for purposes of determining
eligibility for retiree health and welfare benefits, Parent shall give each
employee of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or their respective
Subsidiaries who shall have been employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_
") full credit for prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries
(and any predecessor companies thereto) to the extent such service would be
recognized if it had been performed as an employee of Parent for purposes of
(i) eligibility and vesting under any Parent Employee Plans (as defined
below), but not for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit plan
of Parent, and (ii) unless covered under another arrangement with or of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, determination of benefit levels under any Parent
Employee Plan or policy of general application (including, but not limited
to, for purposes of vacation, sick and paid time off accrual and severance pay
entitlement) in either case for which the Continuing Employees are otherwise
prospectively eligible and in which the Continuing Employees are offered
participation, but except where such credit would result in a duplication of
benefits. For the avoidance of doubt, no Continuing Employee shall be
retroactively eligible for any Parent Employee Plan, including any such
Parent Employee Plan that was frozen prior to the Effective Time. In addition,
Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing conditions
limitations, eligibility waiting periods, evidence of insurability, physical
examination and, with respect to Continuing Employees on disability leave,
actively-at-work requirements, under any medical, dental, pharmaceutical,
vision, disability and/or similar plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries to the
same extent such limitations or requirements would not have been applicable
to such Continuing Employee under the terms of any comparable plan of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Parent Employee Plan_ " means any "employee pension benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined
in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and any other formal written plan or policy under
which service with Parent is relevant to eligibility, vesting and/or level of
benefits, for the benefit of, or relating to, the current employees of Parent
or its Subsidiaries and with respect to which eligibility has not been frozen.
Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be credited to such

 



-50-   Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, and shall not be subject
to accrual limits or other forfeiture policies for the calendar year in which
the Closing occurs, other than the current limits and policies of the
Company.

(b) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall (or
Parent shall cause its Subsidiaries to) provide (i) at least the same level
of base salary or base wages to each Continuing Employee as the base salary or
base wages provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) benefits and severance payments (other than equity-
based benefits, defined benefit pension plan benefits and individual
employment agreements) to each Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, are
substantially similar in the aggregate to the benefits and severance payments
(other than equity based benefits, defined benefit pension plan benefits and
individual employment agreements) provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that, in Parents discretion,
Parent may provide Continuing Employees with benefits in accordance with one
or more of the Company Plans as in effect prior to the Effective Time, which
shall be deemed for purposes of clause (ii) to provide substantially similar
benefits to the comparable programs provided by Parent to its similarly
situated employees; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing herein is intended
to result in a duplication of benefits.

 

(c) To the extent that the Continuing Employees commence participation in the
Parent Employee Plans in the calendar year containing the Closing Date,
Parent shall (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to) cause any eligible expenses
incurred by a Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the
portion of the calendar year of the Company Plan ending on the date
such employees participation in the corresponding Parent Employee Plan
begins to be given full credit under such Parent Employee Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
calendar year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Parent
Employee Plan, and Parent shall (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to) credit
the accounts of such Continuing Employees under any Parent Employee Plan
which is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of
such Continuing Employee under the applicable Company Plan.

 

(d) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to continue any specific employee benefit plans or to
continue the employment of any specific person. The provisions of this
_Section 5.7_ are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and
nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i)
constitute an amendment to any of the compensation and benefits plans
maintained for or provided to Continuing Employees prior to or following
the Effective Time, (ii) impede or limit Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates from amending or terminating any
Company Plan following the Effective Time or (iii) confer upon or give to any
person (including for the avoidance of doubt any current or former employees,
directors, or independent contractors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or
any of its subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or
remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section 5.7_)
under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.

 



-51-  Section 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. From the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company shall promptly notify Parent
of (a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement if such inaccuracy or breach would cause the
conditions in  _Section 6.2(a)_ (with respect to representations and
warranties of the Company) and _Section 6.2(b)_ (with respect to covenants)
to fail to be satisfied at the Effective Time, (b) any Actions against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries commenced, or to its knowledge, threatened
in writing against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to or
involving this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (c) the
receipt of any written communication received from any Person alleging that a
material consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. From the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, Parent shall promptly notify
the Company of (a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty
or covenant contained in this Agreement if such inaccuracy or breach would
cause the conditions in _Section 6.3(a)_ (with respect to representations and
warranties of Parent) and _Section 6.3(b)_ (with respect to covenants) to
fail to be satisfied at the Effective Time (b) any Actions against Parent or
Merger Sub commenced, or to its knowledge, threatened in writing against
Parent or Merger Sub relating to or involving this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or (c) the receipt of any written
communication received from any Person alleging that a material consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or from any Governmental Entity in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The delivery of any
notice pursuant to this _Section 5.8_ shall not (i) cure any breach of, or
non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit the
remedies available to the party sending or receiving such notice.

Section 5.9 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_. 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director or employee may
have under any agreement or Company Plan, from the Effective Time through the
sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs (the "
_Indemnification Period_ "), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each current (as of the Effective
Time) and each former officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against
any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines
and fees, amounts paid in settlement, costs and expenses, including actual
attorneys fees and disbursements (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in
connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, directly or indirectly arising out of or pertaining to the
fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director or fiduciary of
an Acquired Company or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
same extent provided under the Company Constituent Documents (or, as relevant,
those of the applicable Subsidiary of the Company) as of the date of this
Agreement and any Contracts existing between any Indemnified Party and an
Acquired Company as of the date of this Agreement. In the event of any such
Action, each Indemnified Party shall be entitled to advancement of expenses
incurred in the defense of any Action from Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to the same extent provided under the Company Constituent
Documents (or, as relevant, those of the applicable Subsidiary of the Company)
as of the date of this Agreement and any Contracts existing between any
Indemnified Party and an Acquired Company as at the date hereof.
Notwithstanding

 



-52-   anything to the contrary herein (but subject to any superior rights
contained in the Company Constituent Documents (or, as relevant, those of the
applicable Subsidiary of the Company) or applicable indemnification
agreements to which any Acquired Company is a party), prior to making any
payment or advance in respect of the indemnification obligations set forth in
this _Section 5.9_, the Person who is requesting such indemnification or
advance shall agree to repay such payments or advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) Except as may be required by applicable Law, Parent and the Company agree
that during the Indemnification Period, all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now
existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in the Company
Constituent Documents (or, as relevant, those of the Subsidiary) or in
any Contract between such Indemnified Party and an Acquired Company shall
survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect, and during the
Indemnification Period shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in
any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such
Indemnified Party. In addition, during the Indemnification Period, the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses, covering acts
and omissions of directors and officers (and any other employees or agents
who otherwise would be entitled to similar benefits thereunder pursuant to the
terms thereof in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time), in each case
in their respective capacities as such, occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and during
the Indemnification Period, such provisions shall not be repealed, amended or
otherwise modified in any manner except as required by applicable Law.

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to continue to maintain in
effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time for the Persons who,
as of the date of this Agreement, are covered by the Companys and its
Subsidiaries directors and officers liability insurance policies (" _D
andO Insurance_"), DandO Insurance with terms and conditions (including scope and
coverage amounts) that are, taken as a whole, at least as favorable as
provided in the Companys and its Subsidiaries policies as of the date
hereof, or, if such insurance is unavailable, the Surviving Company shall
purchase the best DandO Insurance reasonably available for such six-year period
with terms and conditions (including scope and coverage amounts) that are,
taken as a whole, at least as favorable as provided in the Companys and its
Subsidiaries policies as of the date hereof. Parent may satisfy its
obligations under the prior sentence of this _Section 5.9(c)_ by, prior to
the Effective Time, purchasing and maintaining for the full Indemnification
Period one or more prepaid "tail" insurance policies to be effective at the
Effective Time covering the Persons who, as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, are covered by the Companys existing DandO Insurance, with a
claims period of at least six years from the Effective Time with terms and
conditions (including scope and coverage amounts) that are, taken as a whole,
at least as favorable as the Companys and its Subsidiaries existing DandO
Insurance as of the date hereof, for claims arising from facts or events that
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, covering without limitation the
transactions contemplated hereby. The maximum annual premium for such DandO
Insurance that Parent shall be required to expend shall

 



-53-   not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the total current annual DandO
Insurance premium for the Companys DandO Insurance policies in effect on the
date hereof, which policies and current total annual premiums are set forth
in Section 3.18 of the Company Disclosure Letter; and if such amount is not
sufficient to purchase DandO Insurance in such maximum amount, then Parent shall
purchase such amount of insurance with the best coverage reasonably available
as can be purchased for an annual amount that is equal to three hundred
percent (300%) of the total current annual premium for such policies as in
effect on the date hereof, which total annual premiums are set forth in
Section 3.18 of the Company Disclosure Letter. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to comply with its obligations under such policies for
the full term of at least six years.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) with respect to which an
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification is instituted against any
Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
then the provisions of this _Section 5.9_ shall continue in effect until the
final disposition of such Action.

(e) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant
to Law, Contract or otherwise. After the Effective Time, the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.9_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise
modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any
other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy
referred to in _Section 5.9(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives))
without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or
other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy
referred to in _Section 5.9(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives). The
provisions of this _Section 5.9_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that may be
to the contrary, expressly are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable
by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal
representatives.

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

Section 5.10 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) by
each individual who is subject to the requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under
Rule 16b 3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.11 _Anti-Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Law is or may become
applicable to this Agreement (including the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby), each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and their
respective boards of directors shall use

 



-54-   reasonable best efforts to grant all such approvals and take all such
actions as are reasonably necessary or appropriate so that such transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable hereafter on the terms
contemplated hereby, and otherwise act reasonably to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such Law on such transactions.

Section 5.12 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall provide Parent with
prompt notice of and copies of all proceedings and correspondence relating to
any Action against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors or officers by any stockholder of the Company arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in
the defense or settlement of any such stockholder Action, shall give due
consideration to Parents advice with respect to such stockholder Action.

Section 5.13 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release relating to
this Agreement shall be a joint press release and thereafter, each of Parent
and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall
consult with each other before issuing, and give each other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press
release or make any public announcement without the prior consent of the other
party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) except and solely to the extent required by applicable Law, court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or securities quotation system. The restrictions set forth
in this _Section 5.13_ shall not apply to any release, announcement or
disclosure made or proposed to be made by the Company or Parent with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal, Adverse Recommendation Change or Superior
Proposal, which shall be subject to the terms of  _Section 5.3_.

Section 5.14 _Company Equity Awards_. Promptly following the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall adopt such resolutions and take all necessary
actions to effect the transactions described in _Section 2.1(d)_. Promptly
following the taking of such actions, the Company shall, after consultation
with Parent, deliver to the holders of Company Stock Options, Restricted
Shares, Restricted Stock Units and Stock Appreciation Rights, any required
notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the Company Equity
Plans and this Agreement. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such notices prior to
the mailing thereof to the holders of Company Stock Options, Restricted
Shares, Restricted Stock Units and Stock Appreciation Rights, and the Company
shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to all additions,
deletions, changes or other comments suggested by Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel.

Section 5.15 _Proposed Amendments_

If requested by Parent, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to negotiate and enter into amendments to the Contracts to which it
and/or any of its Subsidiaries is a party that contain terms of the type
described in _Section 3.17(b)(ii)_ to remove such terms.

 



-55-  Section 5.16 _Form S-8_. Parent agrees to file with the SEC, no later than
five (5) Business Days after the date on which the Effective Time occurs, a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form or other applicable
form if a Form S-8 is for any reason unavailable for use by Parent at such
time), relating to the shares of common stock of Parent underlying the
assumed Company Equity Awards and shall use reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement thereafter for so
long as any of such Company Equity Awards remain outstanding.

Section 5.17 _Real Estate Matters_. The Company shall, promptly following the
date of this Agreement, commence those actions necessary to comply with the
New Jersey Industrial Site Remediation Act, N.J. S.A. 13:1K and its
corresponding regulations (the " _ISRA_ "), including, as appropriate,
qualifying for a de minimis exception under ISRA, making any required
notifications in a timely manner, hiring a licensed site remediation
professional (the " _LSRP_ ") to commence the process to comply with the ISRA,
filing a general information notice with the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection (the " _NJDEP_ "), and promptly commencing the
preliminary site assessment contemplated by ISRA (collectively, the " _Initial
Compliance Steps_ "). The Company shall use environmental consultants
reasonably acceptable to Parent. Parent hereby approves Golder and Associates as
such an acceptable consultant and as the LSRP. Parent shall have the right to
review the proposed scope of work for the preliminary assessment, as well as
drafts of the report, and to provide reasonable comments to such materials,
which Parent shall do on a reasonably prompt basis. The Company agrees to
pursue the Initial Compliance Steps diligently and shall use reasonable best
efforts to complete the preliminary assessment report such that it is
available to Parent as soon as reasonably possible, and shall use reasonable
best efforts for it to be delivered to Parent no later than five (5) business
days prior to the Effective Time. The Company agrees to consult with Parent
regarding available options for compliance based on the findings of the
preliminary assessment report and the Company shall not commit to a specific
course of action regarding such findings without Parents prior consent,
which consent shall not unreasonably be conditioned, withheld or delayed.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if all required actions to
comply with ISRA cannot reasonably be (or have not been) fully performed
prior to the first date upon which the Effective Time could otherwise occur
(based on the conditions set forth in Article VI and assuming for such
determination that ISRA were not applicable to the Merger or that the Company
had fully complied with ISRA as of the date of such determination), then the
Company shall (or, if Parent waives such obligation, the Company may) file a
remediation certification with the NJDEP for the purpose of removing any
restrictions under ISRA to the consummation of the Merger prior to completion
of the ISRA process. If the Company fails to commence, or unreasonably delays
the actions required under this _Section 5.17_, Parent may proceed to
undertake those steps necessary to secure ISRA compliance as of the Effective
Time.

order to enter into a definitive agreement to effect a Superior Proposal, if
the Company has made an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such
proposal in compliance with _Section 5.3(e)_ and has complied with _Section

termination and pays the Termination Fee in accordance with the procedures and
