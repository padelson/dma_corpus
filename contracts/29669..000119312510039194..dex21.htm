-iii- _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter called this " _Agreement_ "), dated
as of February 23, 2010, among Bowne and Co., Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
" _Company_ "), R.R. Donnelley and Sons Company, a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), and Snoopy Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ," the Company and Merger
Sub sometimes being hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Constituent
Corporations_ ").

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company
(the " _Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and have approved and declared advisable this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

_The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate existence of the
Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises,
shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in Article II.
The Merger shall have the effects specified in the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as amended (the " _DGCL_ ").

1.2. _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York,
New York, at 9:00 A.M. on the third business day (the " _Closing Date_ ")
following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in
accordance with this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_business day_ " shall mean any day ending at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) other
than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banks are required or authorized
to close in the City of New York.



 

-1- 1.3. _Effective Time_. At or as soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company and Parent will cause a Certificate of Merger (the " _Delaware
Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Delaware
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties in
writing and specified in the Delaware Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective
Time_ ").

ARTICLE II

_Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws_

_of the Surviving Corporation_

2.1. _The Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Charter_ ")
shall be amended in its entirety to read as set forth in Exhibit A hereto,
until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

2.2. _The By-Laws_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so
that the by-laws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _By-Laws_ "),
until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

ARTICLE III

_Officers and Directors of the Surviving Corporation_

3.1. _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that
the board of directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and
after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until
their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and
the By-Laws.

3.2. _Officers_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that
the officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their
successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and
the By-Laws.



 

-2- ARTICLE IV

_Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;_

_Exchange of Certificates_  

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the Common Stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company (a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the " _Shares_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i)
Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent, Shares owned by the Company, Shares held by any
Subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third
parties, and (ii) Shares that are owned by stockholders (" _Dissenting
Stockholders_ ") who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (each Share referred to in clause
(i) or clause (ii) being, an " _Excluded Share_ " and collectively, "
_Excluded Shares_ ")) shall be converted into the right to receive $11.50 per
Share in cash (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective
Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly
representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration,
without interest.

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share (other than any
Shares held by any Subsidiary of the Company, which shall not be cancelled and
shall remain outstanding) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder of the Excluded Share, cease to be
outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and
shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the holder thereof may have under
Section 4.2(f).

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of Common Stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the
Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares,
a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to
make payments under Section 4.1(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investments shall be in 



 

-3-  obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, in money market funds having a rating
in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating
agency at the time of investment or in a combination of the foregoing and, in
any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three
months. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall
become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts
payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly returned to Parent.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event
within five business days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders of
Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent,
such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(e)) in exchange for the Per
Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying
Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (after
giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g))
equal to (x) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(e))
multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due
surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid or are not applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, any holder of Shares that holds such Shares in
book-entry form (rather than through a Certificate) shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying
Agent in order to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder
is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article IV.

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder of the
Certificate is entitled pursuant to this Article IV.



 

-4- (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for nine (9) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with
this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any
required tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) upon due surrender
of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates),
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean
any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 5.1(d))
or other entity of any kind or nature.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond
in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings)
equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration.

(f) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such Person
unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall
be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company shall
give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to
applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to stockholders
rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle
or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.



 

-5- (g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax (as
defined in Section 5.1(n)) Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts
(i) shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

4.3. _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") under the Stock Plans (as defined in
Section 5.1(b)), vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle
the holder of such Company Option to receive, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than three
business days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to the
product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to the Company Option times
(y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per Share under such Company Option, less applicable Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

(b) At the Effective Time, any vesting conditions or restrictions applicable
to any Shares of restricted stock (each such Share a share of " _Company
Restricted Stock_ ") granted pursuant to the Stock Plans shall lapse, and
such Shares of Company Restricted Stock shall be treated the same as all other
Shares in accordance with Section 4.1 of this Agreement, less applicable Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

(c) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. Each outstanding Company Restricted
Stock Unit (each a " _Company RSU_ ") granted pursuant to the Stock Plans,
vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of
such Company RSU to receive as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event no later than three business days after the
Effective Time) an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number
of Shares subject to such Company RSUs immediately prior to the Effective
Time, times (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

(d) _Deferred Stock Units and Deferred Stock Equivalents_. Each outstanding
award of deferred stock unit or deferred stock equivalent, vested or unvested,
granted pursuant to the Stock Plans or Benefit Plans (each such award a "
_Company DSU_ ") shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such
Company DSU to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total
number of Shares subject to such Company DSUs immediately prior to the
Effective Time, times (y) the Per Share 



 

-6-  Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment. The timing of payment in respect of such Company DSUs
will be in accordance with the terms of the applicable Stock Plan or Benefit
Plan.

(e) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to
acquire or receive Shares or benefits measured by the value of Shares, and
each award of any kind consisting of Shares that may be held, awarded,
outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the Stock Plans and any
other Benefit Plans, other than Company Options, Company Restricted Stock,
Company RSUs or Company DSUs (the " _Other Awards_ "), shall be cancelled and
shall only entitle the holder of such Company Award to receive an amount in
cash equal to (x) the number of Shares subject to such Company Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time times (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration (or, if the Company Award provides for payments to the extent
the value of the Shares exceed a specified reference price, the amount, if
any, by which the Per Share Merger Consideration exceeds such reference
price), less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment. The timing of payment in respect of such Company Awards will be in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Stock Plan or Benefit Plan.

(f) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
board of directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the board
of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any necessary
resolutions to implement the provisions of Section 4.3. The Company shall
take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver
Shares or other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or
in settlement of Company Options, Company Restricted Stock, Company RSUs,
Company DSUs or Other Awards (collectively, the " _Company Awards_ ").

4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as
a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.

ARTICLE V

_Representations and Warranties_

5.1.  _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in
the Company Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC (as defined below)
prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding, in each case, any disclosure
set forth in any risk factor or similar section or in any section relating to
forward looking statements), or in the corresponding sections or subsections
of the disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company prior to entering
into this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") 



 

-7-  (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of
the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any
other section or subsection to which the relevance of such item is reasonably
apparent), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub
that:

(a)  _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization
and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as
a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
organized, validly existing, qualified or in good standing, or to have such
power or authority, are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). The
Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of
the Companys and its Significant Subsidiaries certificates of incorporation
and by-laws or comparable governing documents, each as amended to the date of
this Agreement, and each as so delivered is in full force and effect. Within
fourteen (14) days of the date of this Agreement, the Company will make
available to Parent complete and correct copies of the certificates of
incorporation and by-laws or comparable governing documents for any
Subsidiaries of the Company for which such documents had not been made
available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement. Section 5.1(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list, as of the date
of this Agreement, of each jurisdiction where the Company and its
Subsidiaries are organized and qualified to do business.

As used in this Agreement, the term (i) " _Subsidiary_ " means, with respect
to any Person, any other Person of which at least a majority of the securities
or ownership interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a
majority of the board of directors or other persons performing similar
functions is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such Person and/or
by one or more of its Subsidiaries, (ii) " _Significant Subsidiary_ " is as
defined in Rule 1.02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated pursuant to the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") and (iii)
" _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means a material adverse effect on the
financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities, business or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that to the extent any effect is caused by or results from any of
the following, it shall not be taken into account in determining whether there
has been a Company Material Adverse Effect:

(A) changes in the economy or financial markets generally in the United States
or other countries in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries conducts
material operations;

(B) changes that are the result of acts of war or terrorism occurring after
the date of this Agreement;



 

-8- (C) changes that are the result of factors generally affecting the
industry and geographic areas in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
operate, including rules promulgated by the SEC relating to the printing and
distribution of documents;

(D) any loss of, or adverse change in, the relationship of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries with its customers, partners, employees, financing
sources or suppliers caused by the pendency or the announcement of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(E) changes in any Laws (including Laws regulating pensions) or in United
States generally accepted accounting principles or interpretations thereof, in
each case after the date of this Agreement; 

(F) any failure by the Company to meet any estimates of revenues or earnings
for any period ending on or after the date of this Agreement, _provided_ that
the exception in this clause shall not prevent or otherwise affect a
determination that any change, effect, circumstance or development underlying
such failure has resulted in, or contributed to, a Company Material Adverse
Effect;

(G) a decline in the price or trading volume of the Shares on the New
York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "), _provided_ that the exception in this
clause shall not prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any change,
effect, circumstance or development underlying such decline has resulted in,
or contributed to, a Company Material Adverse Effect; and

(H) any act or omission to act by the Company or a Subsidiary thereof
expressly required to be taken or omitted to be taken by it under this
Agreement or specifically consented to in writing by Parent;

_provided_ , _further_ , that, with respect to clauses (A), (B), (C) and (E),
such change, event, circumstance or development does not disproportionately
adversely affect the Company and its Subsidiaries compared to other companies
of similar size operating in the industry in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries operate.

(b) _Capital Structure_.

(i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 60,000,000
Shares, of which 40,094,746 Shares were outstanding as of the close of
business on February 22, 2010 and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of which no shares are outstanding. As of February 22,
2010, 4,122,149 Shares were held in treasury by the Company. All of the
outstanding Shares have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable. Other than 7,827,500 Shares reserved for issuance
under the Companys 1999 Incentive Compensation Plan, amended and restated as
of December 31, 2008 (the " _1999 Plan_ "), 3,000,000 Shares reserved for
issuance 



 

-9-  under the Companys 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, amended and restated as of
December 31, 2008 (the " _2000 Plan_ ") (which Shares reserved for issuance
under the 1999 Plan and 2000 Plan include Shares that can be issued under the
Companys Stock Plan for Directors and the Companys Deferred Sales
Compensation Plan (the 1999 Plan, 2000 Plan, Companys Stock Plan for
Directors and Companys Deferred Sales Compensation Plan, collectively, the "
_Stock Plans_ ")) and Shares subject to issuance under the 5% Convertible
Subordinated Debentures due October 1, 2033 (the " _Debentures_ "),
the Company has no Shares reserved for issuance. Section 5.1(b)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of Company
Awards, including the holder, date of grant, term, number of Shares and, where
applicable, exercise price. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock
or other securities of each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the Company or by a
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of
any lien, charge, pledge, security interest, claim or other encumbrance (each,
a " _Lien_ "). Except as set forth above, there are no preemptive or other
outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation
rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls,
commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other securities
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a
right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are
authorized, issued or outstanding. Upon any issuance of any Shares in
accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans, such Shares will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear
of any Liens. The Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures,
notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
the stockholders of the Company on any matter.

(ii) Section 5.1(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth (x) each
of the Companys Subsidiaries and the ownership interest of the Company in
each such Subsidiary, as well as the ownership interest of any other Person or
Persons in each such Subsidiary, if applicable, and (y) as of the date of
this Agreement, other than with respect to investments in cash equivalents,
the Companys or its Subsidiaries capital stock, equity interest or other
direct or indirect ownership interest in any other Person.

(c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_.

 

(i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken
all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger, subject only to
adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding 



 

-10-  Shares entitled to vote on such matter at a stockholders meeting duly
called and held for such purpose (the " _Requisite Company Vote_ "). This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes
a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity
principles (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

(ii) The board of directors of the Company has (A) unanimously determined that
the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its
stockholders, approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby and resolved to recommend
adoption of this Agreement to the holders of Shares (the " _Company
Recommendation_ "), (B) directed that this Agreement be submitted to the
holders of Shares for their adoption and (C) received the opinion of its
financial advisor, Goldman, Sachs and Co., to the effect that the Per Share
Merger Consideration is fair from a financial point of view, as of the date of
such opinion, to such holders (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) of
Shares. It is agreed and understood that such opinion is for the benefit of
the Companys board of directors and may not be relied upon by Parent or
Merger Sub. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
Parent and Merger Sub in Section 5.2(g), the board of directors of the
Company has taken all action so that Parent will not be an "interested
stockholder" or prohibited from entering into or consummating a "business
combination" with the Company (in each case as such term is used in Section
203 of the DGCL) as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions in the manner contemplated hereby.

(d) _Governmental Filings; No Violations; Certain Contracts_.

(i) Other than the filings, approvals and/or notices (A) pursuant to Section
1.3, (B) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the " _HSR Act_ ") and any other Antitrust Laws, (C) under the
Exchange Act and (D) required to be made with the NYSE (such approvals
referred to in subsections (A) through (D) of this Section 5.1(d)(i), the "
_Company Approvals_ "), no notices, reports or other filings are required to
be made by the Company with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals,
permits or authorizations required to be obtained by the Company from, any
domestic or foreign governmental or regulatory authority, agency, commission,
body, court or other legislative, executive or judicial governmental entity
(each, a " _Governmental Entity_ "), in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except those
that the failure to make or obtain are not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this 



 

-11-  Agreement. " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman Act of 1890, the Clayton
Act of 1914, the HSR Act and any other applicable antitrust, competition,
premerger notification or trade regulation Laws.

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws
of the Company or the comparable governing documents of any of its
Subsidiaries or (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or
violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or default or change of
control right under, the creation or acceleration of any obligations under or
the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to any agreement, lease, license, contract, note,
mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other obligation (each, a " _Contract_ ")
binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, assuming (solely with
respect to performance of this Agreement and consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby) compliance with the matters
referred to in Section 5.1(d)(i), a violation of any Law to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, except, in the case of clause (B)
above, for any such breach, violation, termination, default, change
of control right, creation, acceleration or change that is not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(iii) The Company and its Subsidiaries are not creditors or claimants
with respect to any debtors or debtor-in-possession subject to proceedings
under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code with respect to claims
that, in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the gross assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (excluding cash and cash
equivalents).

(e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements_. 

(i) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all
forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed
or furnished by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ")
pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ ") since December 31, 2006 (the " _Applicable Date_ ") (the
forms, statements, reports and documents filed or furnished since the
Applicable Date and those filed or furnished subsequent to the date of this
Agreement, including any amendments thereto, the " _Company Reports_ "). Each
of the Company Reports, at the time of its filing or being furnished complied
or, if not yet filed or furnished, will comply in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and any rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company Reports. As of
their respective dates (or, if 



 

-12-  amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such
amendment), the Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports filed with or
furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made,
not misleading.

(ii) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE. Except as
permitted by the Exchange Act, including Sections 13(k)(2) and (3) or rules of
the SEC, since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither the Company
nor any of its Affiliates has made, arranged or modified (in any material
way) any extensions of credit in the form of a personal loan to any executive
officer or director of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Affiliate_ " when used with respect to any party shall mean any Person who
is an "affiliate" of that party within the meaning of Rule 405 promulgated
under the Securities Act.

(iii) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by
Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC and
other public disclosure documents. The Company maintains internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under
the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting
is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the Company, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Companys assets that could have a material effect on its
financial statements. The Company has disclosed, based on the most recent
evaluation of its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer
prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Companys auditors and the audit
committee of the Companys board of directors (A) any significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of its internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and has identified for the Companys auditors and audit committee
of the Companys board of directors any material weaknesses in internal
control over 



 

-13-  financial reporting and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. The Company has made
available to Parent (i) a summary of any such disclosure made by management to
the Companys auditors and audit committee since the Applicable Date and (ii)
any material communication since the Applicable Date made by management or
the Companys auditors to the audit committee required or contemplated by
listing standards of the NYSE, the audit committees charter or professional
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Since the
Applicable Date, no material complaints from any source regarding accounting,
internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no concerns from Company
employees regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, have been
received by the Company. The Company has made available to Parent a summary of
all complaints or concerns relating to accounting, financial or internal
control matters made since the Applicable Date through the Companys
whistleblower hot line or equivalent system for receipt of employee concerns
regarding such matters. No attorney representing the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities Laws, breach
of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Companys chief legal officer, audit
committee (or other committee designated for the purpose) of the board of
directors or the board of directors pursuant to the rules adopted pursuant to
Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any Company policy contemplating such
reporting, including in instances not required by those rules. 

(iv) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) fairly presents, or, in the case of Company Reports filed after the
date of this Agreement, will fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of
operations, changes in shareholders equity (deficit) and cash flows included
in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including any
related notes and schedules) fairly presents, or in the case of Company
Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present in all
material respects the results of operations, retained earnings (loss) and
changes in financial position, as the case may be, of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end audit adjustments
that will not be material in amount or effect) and, in each case, have been
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be
noted therein.

(f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2008 through the date of
this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
respective businesses only in, and have not engaged in any material
transaction other than in accordance with, the ordinary course of such
businesses consistent with past practices and there has not been:

(i) any change in the financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities,
business or results of their operations or any circumstance, occurrence or
development (including any adverse change with respect to any circumstance,

management of the Company has knowledge which, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect;

establishment, adoption, entry into or amendment of any collective bargaining
agreement or any material (or in the case of officers or directors of the
Company, any), bonus, profit sharing, thrift, compensation, employment,
termination, severance or other plan, agreement, trust, fund, policy
or arrangement for the benefit of any director, officer or Employee, except
to the extent required by applicable Laws; or

(vi) any agreement to do any of the foregoing.

(g) _Litigation; Liabilities_. (i) There are no civil, criminal or
administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations
or other proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or in
the aggregate, are reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Except for matters arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to the provisions of any judgment, 



 

-15-  order, writ, injunction, decree or award of any Governmental Entity which,

impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(ii) There are no obligations or liabilities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries required by GAAP to be reflected in a consolidated balance sheet

including in the notes thereto, (B) were incurred in the ordinary course of
business since the date of such financial statements, (C) have been
discharged or paid in full prior to the date of this Agreement in the ordinary
course of business or (D) individually or in the aggregate, have not had or

As used in this Agreement, the term "knowledge" when used in the phrases
"to the knowledge of the Company," "of which the Company has knowledge" or
"the Company has no knowledge" or words of similar import shall mean the
actual knowledge, following due inquiry or investigation, of David Shea,
William Penders, John Walker, Scott Spitzer and Susan Cummiskey.

(h) _Employee Benefits_.

(i) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or arrangements
covering current or former employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (the
" _Employees_ ") and current or former directors of the Company, including,
but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section
3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("
_ERISA_ "), and deferred compensation, severance, stock option, stock
purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock based, incentive and bonus,
workers compensation, short-term and long-term disability and vacation
plans, programs or arrangements, and any and all employment, individual
consulting, severance, change in control and termination agreements

_Non-U.S. Benefit Plans_ "), are listed on Section 5.1(h)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, and each Benefit Plan which has received a favorable

-16- (ii) All Benefit Plans, other than "multiemployer plans" within the meaning

Benefit Plans, (collectively, " _U.S. Benefit Plans_ ") are in substantial
compliance with ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ ") and other applicable Laws and have been administered in accordance
with their terms. Each U.S. Benefit Plan which is subject to ERISA (an "
_ERISA Plan_ ") that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a " _Pension Plan_ ") intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") with respect to its
qualified status under Section 401(a) of the Code and the exempt status of any
related trust under Section 501(a) of the Code, or has applied to, or
has time remaining in which to file an application with, the IRS for such
favorable determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment period
under Section 401(b) of the Code, and the Company is not aware of any
circumstances likely to result in the loss of the qualified or exempt status
of such Plan or trust under Section 401(a) or Section 501(a) of the Code.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries maintain any voluntary
employees beneficiary association within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of
the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a

of such transaction expired as of the date of this Agreement, could subject
the Company or any Subsidiary to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section
4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would be
material. The Company or its Subsidiaries have timely filed all required
notices to all Pension Plan participants under Section 204(h) of ERISA.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably
expects to incur a material tax or penalty imposed by Section 4980F of the
Code or Section 502 of ERISA or any material liability under Section 4071 of
ERISA.

expected to be incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect
to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by
any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one
employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the
Code (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ "). The Company and its Subsidiaries have not
incurred and do not expect to incur any material withdrawal liability with
respect to a Multiemployer Plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of
ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate).
No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA
for which the reporting requirement has not been waived or extended, other
than pursuant to Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") Reg.
Section 4043.33 or 4043.66, has been required to be filed for any Pension Plan
or by any ERISA Affiliate within the 12 month period ending on the date of
this Agreement or is reasonably expected to be required to be filed in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No event
giving rise to any obligation of the 



 

-17-  Company or any ERISA Affiliate under Section 4062(e) of ERISA has occurred
within the 12-month period ending on the date of this Agreement. No notices
have been required to be sent to participants and beneficiaries or the PBGC
under Section 302 or 4011 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

(iv) All contributions required to be made under each Benefit Plan, as of the
date of this Agreement, have been timely made and all obligations in respect
of each Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the most
recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the
Company Reports prior to the date of this Agreement. Neither any Pension Plan
nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate is in "at-risk" status
within the meaning of Section 303 of ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has an
outstanding funding waiver. As of the date of this Agreement, neither any
Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has been
required to file information pursuant to Section 4010 of ERISA for the
current or most recently completed plan year.

(v) Under each Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, as of the last
day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date of this Agreement,
the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities," within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of
the actuarial assumptions contained in such Pension Plans most recent
actuarial valuation), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of
such Pension Plan, and there has been no material change in the financial
condition, whether or not as a result of a change in funding method, of such
Pension Plan from the last day of the most recent plan year through the date
of this Agreement.

(vi) As of the date of this Agreement, there is no material pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company threatened, litigation relating to the Benefit Plans
and, as of the Closing Date, there will be no such litigation, except as would
not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree
health and life benefits under any ERISA Plan or collective bargaining
agreement.

(vii) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for
the most recent fiscal year. Neither the execution of this Agreement,
stockholder adoption of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will, either alone or when combined with
another event or events, (w) entitle any Employees to severance pay or an
increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date of
this Agreement, (x) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in
any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation
or benefits under, increase the amount payable or result in any other
obligation pursuant to, any of the 



 

-18-  Benefit Plans (y) limit or restrict the right of the Company or, after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent to merge, amend
or terminate any of the Benefit Plans or (z) result in payments under any of
the Benefit Plans which would not be deductible as a result of Section 280G of
the Code.

(viii) All Non-U.S. Benefit Plans comply in all material respects with
applicable local law. All Non-U.S. Benefit Plans are listed on Section
5.1(h)(viii) of the Company Disclosure Letter. As of the date of this
Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries have no material unfunded
liabilities with respect to any such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan. As of the date of
this Agreement, there is no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened material litigation relating to Non-U.S. Benefit Plans and as of
the Closing Date, there will be no such litigation, except as would not be
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(i) _Compliance with Laws; Licenses_. The businesses of each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries have not been, and are not being, conducted in violation
of any federal, state, local or foreign law, statute or ordinance, common law,
or any rule, regulation, standard, judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree,
arbitration award, agency requirement, license or permit of any Governmental
Entity (collectively, " _Laws_ "), except for violations that, individually or
in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No investigation or review by
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor has
any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same, except
for such investigations or reviews the outcome of which are not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the knowledge of the
Company, the Company has not received any notice or communication of any
material noncompliance with any such Laws that has not been cured as of the
date of this Agreement. The Company and its Subsidiaries each has obtained and

consents, authorizations, franchises, variances, exemptions and orders issued
or granted by a Governmental Entity necessary to conduct its business as

Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

union or labor organization to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is

transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not entitle any third party
(including any labor union or labor organization) to any payments under any of
the Company Labor Agreements. There is no charge pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened before the National Labor Relations Board or any
other labor relations tribunal or authority alleging unlawful discrimination
in employment practices or any unfair labor practice by the Company or any of

Subsidiaries, would reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Except as would not reasonably be likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, each individual who is classified by the Company as an

to, such Intellectual Property.

contributed to the development or creation of Intellectual Property have

of any escrow or similar agreement or arrangement giving any third party
rights in such Software upon the occurrence of certain events.

have a Company Material Adverse Effect, none of the Software owned by the

provision of any open source or other type of license agreement or
distribution model that: (i) requires the distribution or making available of

-34- 6.2. _Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. The Company agrees that, except as
expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries
shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to instruct and cause
its and its Subsidiaries employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives (such directors,
officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
advisors or representatives, collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to,
directly or indirectly:

(i) initiate, solicit or encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal
or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal (as defined below); or

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or data to any
Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; or

(iii) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal.

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to the time,
but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company may (A)
provide information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made
an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the Company receives
from the Person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality
agreement on terms not less restrictive, taken as a whole, to the other party
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section
9.7) (not including paragraph 8 thereof) and promptly discloses (and,
if applicable, provides copies of) any such information to Parent to the
extent not previously provided to Parent; (B) engage or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made such an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal; or (C) after having complied with
Section 6.2(c), approve, recommend, or otherwise declare advisable or propose
to approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) such an
Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (x) prior to taking any
action described in clause (A), (B) or (C) above, the board of directors of
the Company determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (y) in each such case
referred to in clause (A) or (B) above, the board of directors of the Company
has determined in good faith based on the information then available and
after consultation with its financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal
either constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below) or is reasonably
likely to result in a Superior Proposal, and (z) in the case referred to in
clause (C) above, the board of directors of the Company determines in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.



 

-35- (b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer with respect to a
merger, consolidation, liquidation, recapitalization, reorganization or
similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries and (ii) any acquisition by any Person resulting in, or proposal
or offer to acquire by tender offer, share exchange or in any manner,
directly or indirectly, in one or a series of related transactions, 20% or
more of the total voting power or of any class of equity securities of the
Company or those of any of its Subsidiaries, or 20% or more of the
consolidated total assets (including, without limitation, equity securities
of its Subsidiaries) of the Company, in each case other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal for
more than 50% of the assets (on a consolidated basis) of the Company or 50% of
the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company that the board
of directors of the Company has determined in its good faith judgment (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is
reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into
account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the
Person making the proposal, and if consummated, would result in a transaction
more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view
than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account
any revisions to the terms of the transaction that may be proposed by Parent).

(c) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. The
board of directors of the Company and each committee of the board of directors
shall not:

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger; or

(ii) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, Section
8.3(a) hereof, cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in Section 6.2(a) entered into in compliance with Section 6.2(a))
(an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any Acquisition
Proposal.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the board of
directors of the Company may withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify the Company
Recommendation (whether in connection with a Superior Proposal or otherwise)
or approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Superior Proposal
made after the 



 

-36-  date of this Agreement that was not solicited, initiated, encouraged or
knowingly facilitated in material breach of Section 6.2(a), if the board of
directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary obligations under applicable Law (a " _Change of
Recommendation_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no Change of
Recommendation may be made until after at least 48 hours following Parents
receipt of notice from the Company advising that management of the Company
currently intends to recommend to its board of directors that it take such
action and the basis therefor, including all necessary information under
Section 6.2(f), if applicable. In determining whether to make a Change of
Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal, the Company board
of directors shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent and any other information provided by Parent in
response to such notice. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal
will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of Section 6.2.

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to stockholders) or making any "stop look and listen"
communication to its stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act (or any similar communication to stockholders); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if such disclosure has the substantive effect of withdrawing or adversely
modifying the Company Recommendation, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a
Change in Recommendation and Parent shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement as set forth in Section 8.4(a).

(e)  _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that it will immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it will take the necessary
steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in the first
sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.2 and in the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Company also agrees that it will (i) promptly
request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement
in connection with its consideration of acquiring it or any of its
Subsidiaries to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries and
(ii) enforce and not waive the terms of any such confidentiality agreement.

(f) _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within 24 hours) notify Parent if any inquiries, proposals or offers
(including requests for information) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
are received by, or any discussions or negotiations regarding an Acquisition
Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its
Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of
such Person and the material terms and conditions thereof (including, if
applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed 



 

-37-  agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis,
of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any
amendments thereto) and the status of any discussions or negotiations with
respect thereto, including any change in the Companys intentions as
previously notified.

6.3. _Proxy Filing; Information Supplied_.

(a) (a) The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, a proxy statement in preliminary
form relating to the Stockholders Meeting (as defined in Section 6.4) (such
proxy statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the "
_Proxy Statement_ "). The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to comply
in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Company agrees that none of the
information supplied by it or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date of mailing
to stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with the Company in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement and shall furnish all information
concerning Parent and Merger Sub as is required to be included in the Proxy
Statement. Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that none of the written
information supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement will, at the time the Proxy Statement is mailed to
stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of any comments
from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by the
SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and
shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence between the
Company or any of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement. The Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best
efforts promptly to provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments
received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC, and the Company shall cause the
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as possible after the
date the staff of the SEC advises that it has no further comments thereon or
that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement.

6.4. _Stockholders Meeting_. The Company will take, in accordance with
applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and by-laws, all action
necessary to convene a meeting of holders of Shares (the " _Stockholders
Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement to
consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement. Subject to Section
6.2(c) hereof, the board of directors of the Company shall recommend such
adoption and shall take all reasonable lawful action to solicit such adoption
of this Agreement.

(a) _Cooperation_.

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the

all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this
Agreement, and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
reasonably practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as
reasonably practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices,
reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable
all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary
or, in Parents or the Companys reasonable opinion, advisable to be obtained

_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement, including this
Section 6.5(a) or the "reasonable best efforts" or other similar standard
generally, shall require, or be construed to require, Parent to proffer to, or
agree to, or to permit the Company to proffer to or agree to, with respect to
assets or businesses of Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries,
sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or
hold separate or agree to sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of

consent to any sale, divestiture, lease, license, transfer, disposition or
other encumberment by the Company of any of its assets, licenses, operations,
rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein or to any agreement by
the Company to take any of the foregoing actions) or to agree to any material
changes (including through a licensing arrangement) or restriction on, or
other impairment of Parents ability to own or operate, any such assets,
licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interests therein
or Parents ability to vote, transfer, receive dividends or otherwise
exercise full ownership rights with respect to the stock of the Surviving
Company, _except_ that Parent acknowledges that its reasonable best efforts
under this Section 6.5(a)(i) include an obligation that Parent grant a
license in respect of, dispose of or hold separate, or enter into an agreement
or commitment to grant a license in respect of, dispose of or hold separate,
assets, licenses, operations, rights, businesses or interests therein or
business product lines of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with
the performance of its obligations under this Section 6.5(a)(i), if, and only
if, all of the following criteria are satisfied: (A) such license, disposal or
hold separate (the " _Consent_  



 

-39- _ Agreement_ ") is required or imposed by a Governmental Entity to permit the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under applicable Antitrust Laws and (B) the assets, licenses,
operations, rights, businesses or interests therein or business product lines
that would be divested or held separate or otherwise affected by all Consent
Agreements collectively produced gross revenues in an amount that is less
than 5% of the gross revenues of the Company and its Subsidiaries during the
2009 calendar year (the " _Consent Cap_ "). Parent shall, subject to the
Consent Cap and Section 7.2(c), propose, negotiate, offer to commit to and
effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent
decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the licensing, hold separate or

interests therein or business product lines of the Company and its
Subsidiaries so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably
possible (and in any event, not later than the Termination Date, or if such

Termination Date). Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, Parent shall have the right to direct all matters with any
Governmental Entity consistent with its obligations hereunder; _provided_
that Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance and, to
the extent practicable, each will consult with the other on and consider in
good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the information

respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Proxy Statement). In exercising the foregoing rights,
each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. The Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to consult with each other in advance of any meeting, discussion,
substantive telephone call or conference with the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade Commission (the "
_FTC_ ") or any other Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, provide to the other party the opportunity to attend

or conference. The Company will cooperate with Parent and provide such
assistance as Parent may reasonably request to promote the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and facilitate the Closing hereunder.

(ii) Each of the Company and Parent will (A) make an appropriate notice
filing pursuant to the HSR Act and appropriate filings under all other

respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to such request for additional
information and (D) subject to Section 6.5(a)(i), resist in good faith, at
its own cost and expense (subject to Section 8.5(c)), any assertion by any
Governmental Entity that the transactions contemplated hereby constitute a
violation of any Antitrust Law, including by contesting administratively and
in court any adverse determination made by a Governmental Entity under any
applicable Antitrust Law, if such assertion or determination is reasonably
likely to materially delay, impair or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(iii) Nothing in this Agreement, including this Section 6.5, shall require,
or be construed to require, the Company or its Subsidiaries to proffer to, or
agree to, license, dispose of, sell or otherwise hold separate or restrict the
operation of, any of the assets, licenses, operations, rights, business or
interest therein of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries unless the
effectiveness of such action is conditioned upon Closing.

(b) _Information_. Subject to applicable Law, the Company and Parent each
shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection

Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

give prompt notice to Parent of any change, fact or condition that
is reasonably expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or of
any failure of any condition to Parents obligations to effect the Merger.

condition that is reasonably expected to result in any failure of any
condition to the Companys obligations to effect the Merger.

warranty made by the Company herein, and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit any inspection, or to
disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would
result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any
of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have
used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such
inspection or disclosure or (ii) to disclose any privileged information of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All requests for information made

base salaries that are no less than the base salaries provided by the Company
and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) welfare
benefits under employee benefit plans that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those welfare benefits that, at the election of Parent, are
currently provided by either (x) the Company and its Subsidiaries to such
Employees or (y) are provided from time to time by Parent to its similarly
situated employees.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or
arrangement, the Company shall (i) cause to be amended the employee benefit
plans and arrangements of it and its Subsidiaries to the extent necessary to
provide that no employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries shall commence
participation therein following the Effective Time unless the
Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary explicitly authorizes such
participation and (ii) cause the Companys 401(k) Plan to be terminated
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) Except to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits, Parent
shall cause any employee benefit plans (including vacation, severance and
disability plans) covering Continuing Employees to take into account, for
purposes of eligibility, benefits (excluding accruals under a defined benefit
plan or for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement
benefits), participation (including "grandfathering" generally but excluding
"grandfathering" for any frozen plan or benefit) and vesting thereunder
service by such Continuing Employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries
(and, to the extent applicable, their respective predecessors but only to the
same extent as currently recognized by the Company as of the date of this
Agreement under corresponding benefits, if applicable) as if such service were
with Parent, to the same extent that such service was taken into account,
waived or satisfied under a comparable plan of the Company of its
Subsidiaries, provided, that no credit shall be given under frozen benefit
plans or defined benefit plans. For purposes of each employee benefit plan of
Parent providing medical, dental, prescription drug, vision, life insurance or
disability benefits to any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
Parent shall cause its employee benefit plans to waive all pre-
existing condition exclusions of its employee benefit plans with respect to
Continuing Employees and their dependents to the same extent such exclusions
were waived under a comparable plan of the Company.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor and shall cause its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to
honor, in accordance with its terms, each Benefit Plan set forth in Section
6.9(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(e) To the extent that applicable cash bonuses for 2010 have not otherwise
been paid by the Company to Employees prior to the Effective Time, each
Employee who is a participant in the Companys annual incentive plan and
performance incentive plan (the " _Cash Bonus Plans_ "), who remains employed
through such date, shall earn and be paid, in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Cash Bonus Plans 



 

-43-  existing as of the date of this Agreement, a cash bonus in an amount equal
to a pro-rata portion of the amounts earned under the Cash Bonus Plans based
on actual performance during 2010 through the end of the quarter during which
the Effective Time occurs (the " _Bonus Determination Date_ "); provided,
however, that the portion of the bonus calculated based on the number of days
it takes the Company to collect revenue after a sale (" _Day Sales
Outstanding_ ") be calculated based on the trailing 12 month average of Day
Sales Outstanding as of the Bonus Determination Date. Additionally, cash
bonuses for quarters beginning after the Effective Time (including for the
remaining quarters of the calendar year during which the Effective Time
occurs) shall be earned and paid based on actual performance in accordance
with the Parents corresponding cash bonus plan; provided, however, that any
Employee whose employment is terminated without cause by the Company or its
Affiliates after the Effective Time and prior to the applicable bonus payment
date for the year in which the Effective Time occurs shall be paid a pro-rata
bonus through the Bonus Determination Date, paid within 30 days following
such Employees termination of employment. For the avoidance of doubt, all
bonus payments under the Cash Bonus Plans pursuant to this Section 6.9(e)
shall be accrued, earned and paid solely in cash, and shall not include any
equity award component.

(f) For each Benefit Plan set forth in Section 6.9(f) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" or
"change in control" within the meaning of each such Benefit Plan will occur
upon the Effective Time.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (1) be
treated as an amendment of any particular Benefit Plan, (2) give any third
party any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.9 or (3) obligate
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to (i) maintain
any particular benefit plan or (ii) retain the employment of any particular
employee.

(h) Prior to Closing, the Company will be permitted to adopt (and, in
accordance with Section 6.1(b), communicate to participants) a retention
program in accordance with the terms set forth on Section 6.9(h) of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

6.10. _Expenses_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the
transactions contemplated in Article IV, and Parent shall reimburse the
Surviving Corporation for such charges and expenses. Except as otherwise
provided in Section 8.5, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, and the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such expense.

6.11.  _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each
case, when 



 

-44-  acting in such capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or
was an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii)
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated by this
Agreement), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under
Delaware law and its certificate of incorporation or by-laws in effect on the
date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person (and Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by
Delaware law or the Companys or applicable Subsidiaries certificate of
incorporation or by-laws in effect on the date of this Agreement, to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled
to indemnification).

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph
(a) of this Section 6.11, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of
any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such
failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or
after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have
the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if
Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or
counsel for the Indemnified Parties and advises that there are issues which
raise conflicts of interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and
the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
satisfactory to them, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
promptly as statements therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to
this paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified
Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified
Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, _provided_
that the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest
shall be used; (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of
any such matter; and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without their prior written consent; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final and non-appealable, that the indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law.



 

-45- (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims
period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO
Insurance_") with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as
the Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall the Company expend for such policies a premium amount
in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for its
DandO Insurance. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason
fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from
and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this
Agreement with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as
provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement,
or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable DandO
Insurance for such six-year period with benefits and levels of coverage
at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of
the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies an
annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid
by the Company for such insurance; and, _provided further_ that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.11 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate
of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
under any applicable Contracts or Laws.



 

-46- 6.12. _Other Actions by the Company_.

(a) _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and its board of directors shall, subject to applicable Law, grant
such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

(other than a confidentiality agreement) with respect to, or shall have
consummated or shall have approved or recommended to the Companys
stockholders or otherwise not opposed, an Acquisition Proposal made by or on

the agreements contained in this Section 8.5(b) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due
pursuant to this Section 8.5(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
or Merger Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company
for the fee set forth in this Section 8.5(b) or any portion of such fee, the
Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub its out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together
with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of
payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
parties hereby acknowledge that in the event that the Termination Fee becomes
payable and is paid by the Company pursuant to this Section 8.5(b), the
Termination Fee shall be Parents and Merger Subs sole and exclusive remedy
for monetary damages under this Agreement.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to (i)
Section 8.2(a) (Termination Date) and at the time of such termination, all of
the conditions to closing set forth in Article VII have been satisfied or
waived (except for those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing) other than the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(b) or
Section 7.2(c); _provided_ that the Company was not in material breach of its
obligations under Section 6.5(a), (b) or (c) or (ii) Section 8.2(c) (Final
Order) where there is a final non-appealable Order permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger under any
Antitrust Laws; _provided_ that the Company was not in material breach of its
obligations under Section 6.5(a), (b) or (c), then Parent shall promptly, but
in no event later than two days after being notified of such by the Company,
pay to the Company a termination fee of $20,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination
Fee_ ") and shall promptly, but in no event later than two days after being
notified of such by the Company, pay all of the documented out-of-pocket
expenses of the Company for its outside legal counsel in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement up to a maximum
amount of $2,500,000, in each case, payable by wire transfer of same day
funds. Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
8.5(c) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Company would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if Parent 



 

-52-  fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.5(c), and,
in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit that results in
a judgment against Parent for the fee set forth in this Section 8.5(c) or any
portion of such fee, Parent shall pay to the Company its reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime
rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date of payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the parties hereby acknowledge that in the event the Parent
Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by Parent pursuant to this Section
8.5(c), the Parent Termination Fee shall be the Companys sole and exclusive
remedy for monetary damages under this Agreement.

appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in
or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims
relating to such action, proceeding or transactions shall be heard and
determined in such a Delaware State or Federal court. The parties hereby

AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND

UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO

any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the Court of the Chancery of the State of
Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is

Directors and Officers Insurance) only, Parent and the Company hereby agree
that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth
herein are solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance
with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not
intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including, without limitation, the
right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
parties hereto further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries
under Section 6.11 shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs.
The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 9.3 without
notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

9.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall
be 



 

-56-  deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. 

9.10. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by Parent and Merger Sub

liability for any such taxes.

9.11. _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in Annex A is defined in the
Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

9.12. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

9.13. _Interpretation; Construction_. 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a
Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever
the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. 

(c) Each party to this Agreement has or may have set forth information in its
respective Disclosure Letter in a section of such Disclosure Letter that
corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The fact
that any item of information is disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this
Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to
be disclosed by this Agreement.



 

-57- 9.14. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law
or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may designate, by written
notice to the Company, another wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary to
be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all
references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other
subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein with
respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other subsidiary as
of the date of such designation; _provided_ that any such designation shall
not materially impede or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise materially impede the rights of
the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement. Any purported assignment
in violation of this Agreement is void.



 

-58- IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
duly authorized officers of the parties hereto as of the date first written
above.
