issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held by
any wholly owned Company Subsidiary shall automatically be retired and shall
cease to exist, and no Merger Consideration shall be paid, nor shall any other
payment be made or right inure with respect thereto in connection with or as a
consequence of the Merger. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held by Parent or

would have been converted pursuant to this _Section 3.1(a)_ (the "
_Fractional Share Consideration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , (x) if the
Average Parent Trading Price is greater than $6.36 and less than $6.58, the

Parent Common Share), and (y) if the Average Parent Trading Price is equal to
or greater than $6.58, the Exchange Ratio shall be 1.650.

Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any

similar transaction, then without limiting any other rights of the other
Parties hereunder, the Exchange Ratio will be ratably adjusted to the extent

and _6.2(b)(iii)_ , between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,

class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then without
limiting any other rights of the other Parties hereunder, the Exchange Ratio
will be ratably adjusted to the extent necessary or appropriate to reflect
fully the effect of such change.

 



 

(c) _Share Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, the share
transfer books of Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Company Common Stock. From and after the
Effective Time, Persons who held Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such shares, except

3.1(a)(ii)_ and _3.6_.

 



 

(b) At or before the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of the Parent Common Shares in
book-entry form equal to the aggregate shares to be issued as Merger
Consideration and (ii) cash in immediately available funds in an amount
sufficient to pay the Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends under
_Section 3.2(e)_ (such evidence of book-entry Parent Common Shares, and cash
amounts, together with any dividends or other distributions with respect
thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock. Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make delivery of the Merger
Consideration, payment of the Fractional Share Consideration and any amounts
payable in respect of dividends or other distributions on Parent Common Shares
in accordance with _Section 3.2(e)_ out of the Exchange Fund in accordance
with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange
Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving Entity. Interest and other income
on the Exchange Fund shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Surviving
Entity and shall be paid to the Surviving Entity as the Surviving Entity
directs. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve the Parent, the
Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by
this _Article 3_, and following any losses from any such investment, the
Parent or the Surviving Entity shall promptly provide additional funds to the
Exchange Agent to the extent necessary to satisfy the Parents and the
Surviving Entitys obligations hereunder for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time, which additional funds
will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund.

 



 

(d) _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Entity shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and to make available for
collection by hand) to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share (A) a letter of transmittal (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), in
customary form as prepared by Parent and reasonably acceptable to Company,
which shall specify, among other things, that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or transfer of any Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or the
transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration into
which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall have been converted pursuant to
this Agreement and the Merger, together with any amounts payable in respect of
the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.6_ and
dividends or other distributions on Parent Common Shares in accordance with
_Section 3.2(e)_.

 



 

(ii) Upon (A) surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or transfer of any Book-Entry Share to the Exchange Agent, together
with a properly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal or (B)
receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence,
if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case
of transfer of a Book-Entry Share, and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article 3_ plus any Fractional Share Consideration that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section 3.6_ and any amounts
that such holder has the right to receive in respect of dividends or other
distributions on Parent Common Shares in accordance with _Section 3.2(e)_, by
mail or by wire transfer after the Exchange Agents receipt of such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or "agents message" or
other evidence, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) so
surrendered or the Book-Entry Share so transferred, as applicable, shall be
forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with
such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary exchange
practices. Until surrendered or transferred as contemplated by this _Section
3.2_, each Certificate

 



      
 

 



 

and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, at any time after the Effective Time, to
represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this _Article 3_. No interest shall be paid
or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
on the Merger Consideration or the Fractional Share Consideration payable upon
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and any distributions
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_.

 



 

(iii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of Company, it shall be a
condition of payment that any Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or
transferred in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 3.2_
shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any Transfer Taxes
and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration
to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered,
or Book-Entry Share transferred, or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable.

 



 

(e) _Dividends with respect to Parent Common Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share not transferred with respect to the number of
whole Parent Common Shares issuable to such holder hereunder, and all such
dividends and other distributions shall instead be paid by Parent to the
Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until
the surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
transfer of such Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Agreement. Subject
to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of any Book-Entry Share there shall be
paid to the holder thereof, without interest: (i) the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to the number of whole Parent Common Shares to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement; and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment
date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such Parent Common
Shares.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest and income received with respect thereto and any
Fractional Share Consideration and any applicable dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares) that remains undistributed
to the former holders of shares of Company Common Stock for twelve (12) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
former holders of Company Common Stock prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article 3_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent and the Surviving Entity (and only as general creditors thereof) for
payment of the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, Company, the Surviving Entity,
the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate
thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of the Merger Consideration,
as applicable, if the Exchange Fund has been delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any shares of Company Common

 



      
 

 



 

Stock immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise
escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Entity, free and clear of any claims or interest of such holders or their
successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

 



 

 _Section 3.3_ _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity
and the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any
other amounts otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock pursuant
to this Agreement, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to such payments under the Code or any other provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law. Any such amounts so deducted and withheld shall be paid
over to the applicable Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable
Law and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 



 

 _Section 3.4_ _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Entity may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled
pursuant to this _Article 3_.

 



 

 _Section 3.5_ _Dissenters Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights, or
rights of objecting stockholders under Title 3, Subtitle 2 of the MGCL, shall
be available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including any remedy under Sections 3-201 et seq. of the
MGCL.

 



 

 _Section 3.6_ _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional Parent Common Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates or the transfer of Book-Entry Shares, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock
converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ who would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction of a Parent Common Share shall receive, in lieu thereof,
cash, without interest, in an amount equal to the product of (i) the volume
weighted average price of a Parent Common Share for the last full trading day
ending immediately prior to the Effective Time, as reported by Bloomberg,
multiplied by (ii) such fraction of a Parent Common Share.

 



 

 _Section 3.7_ _General Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the
effect of the Merger shall be as set forth in this Agreement and as provided
in the applicable provisions of the MGCL and the MLLCA. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all of
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company shall vest
in the Surviving Entity, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Company
shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Entity.

REIT for such years; (ii) has operated since January 1, 2014 to the date

corporation that qualifies as a Qualified REIT Subsidiary or as a Taxable REIT

Knowledge of Company, threatened, by any Governmental Authority, which

Subsidiary has waived any statute of limitations with respect to the
assessment of material Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect
to any material Tax assessment or deficiency for any open tax year; (iv)
neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary currently is the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return; and (v)

liability company and that has not elected to be a Taxable REIT Subsidiary has
been since its formation treated for United States federal income tax purposes

REITs) and (iii) none of Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred any
material liability for Tax other than (A) in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, or (B) transfer or similar Taxes arising in
connection with sales of property. No event has occurred, and no condition or
circumstances exists, which presents a material risk that any material
liability for Taxes described in clause (i) or (iii) of the preceding sentence
or any liability for Taxes described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence
will be imposed upon Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 



 

(g) Company and the Company Subsidiaries have complied, in all material
respects, with all applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of

any Company Subsidiary other than the Net-Lease Properties. Neither Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has any liabilities with respect to the Net-Lease
Properties or under any contract or arrangement of any Net-Lease Company.

 



 

(b) The consideration provided pursuant to the Net-Lease Purchase Agreement
and the Bulwark Purchase Agreement (i) is fair and reasonable and (ii)
constitutes reasonably equivalent value and fair consideration under Title 11
of the United States Code and under the Laws of the United States, any state,
territory, possession or the District of Columbia.

 



 

(c) The Net-Lease Sale was not made to hinder, delay or defraud any creditor
of any Net-Lease Company.

 



 

(d) As of the date hereof and upon the consummation of the Net-Lease Sale
pursuant to the terms of the Net-Lease Purchase Agreement and the Bulwark
Purchase Agreement, each Net-Lease Company (i) is and will be Solvent, (ii)
has and will have sufficient capital for carrying on its business and (iii) is
and will be able to pay its debts as they mature. As

 



      
 

 



 

used in this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " means, with respect to a
particular date, that on such date (A) the present fair market value (or
present fair saleable value) of the assets of each Net-Lease Company is not
less than the total amount required to pay the liabilities of each Net-Lease
Company on its total existing debts and liabilities (including contingent
liabilities) as they become absolute and matured; (B) each Net-Lease Company
is able to pay its debts and other liabilities, contingent obligations and

Laws.

 



 

(e) Each of the Net-Lease Sellers had as of the date of the Net-Lease Purchase

Lease Purchase Agreement or the Bulwark Purchase Agreement, as the case may
be, and has the requisite organizational power and authority to perform its
obligations thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Net-Lease Purchase Agreement or the Bulwark Purchase Agreement, as the case
may be. The execution and delivery of the Net-Lease Purchase Agreement or the
Bulwark Purchase Agreement, as the case may be, by each of the Net-Lease
Sellers, and the consummation by each of the Net-Lease Sellers of the
transactions contemplated thereby has been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate or limited liability company action, and no other
corporate or limited liability company proceedings on the part of each of the
Net-Lease Sellers is necessary to authorize the Net-Lease Purchase Agreement
or the Bulwark Purchase Agreement, as the case may be, or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated thereby. No vote of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock or any other class or series of capital stock or other
equity securities of Company is required in connection with the execution or
delivery of the Net-Lease Purchase Agreement or the Bulwark Purchase
Agreement, as the case may be, by any of the Net-Lease Sellers or in
connection with the consummation by any of the Net-Lease Sellers of any of the
transactions contemplated by the Net-Lease Purchase Agreement or the Bulwark
Purchase Agreement, as the case may be. The Net-Lease Purchase Agreement or
the Bulwark Purchase Agreement, as the case may be, has been duly executed and
delivered by each of the Net-Lease Sellers and, assuming the Net-Lease
Purchase Agreement was duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Net-
Lease Purchaser, constitutes a legally valid and binding obligation of each of
the Net-Lease Sellers, respectively, enforceable against it in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, preference, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or
other similar Laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of
creditors and by general principles of equity regardless of whether
enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law. The Tranche I
Closing (as defined in the Net-Lease Purchase Agreement) has been consummated
prior to the date hereof and at such Tranche I Closing, the Net-Lease
Properties and related Net-Lease Companies listed on _Section 4.26_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter have been acquired by the Net-Lease Purchaser.

 



 

(f) The execution and delivery of the Net-Lease Purchase Agreement or the
Bulwark Purchase Agreement, as the case may be, by any of the Net-Lease
Sellers does not, and

 



      
 

 



 

the performance of the Net-Lease Purchase Agreement or the Bulwark Purchase
Agreement, as the case may be, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby by any of the Net-Lease Sellers will not, (i) conflict
with or violate any provision of the Company Charter or Company Bylaws or any
equivalent organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary, (ii) conflict
with or violate any Law applicable to Company or any Company Subsidiary or by
which any property or asset of Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or
(iii) require any consent or approval under, result in any breach of or any
loss of any benefit under, or result in the triggering of any payments
pursuant to, or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse
of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any right of
termination, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a
Lien on any property or asset of Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant
to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license,
permit or other legally binding obligation to which Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party, except (x) under any Assumed Mortgage or the Market
Place Mortgage (each as defined in the Net-Lease Purchase Agreement) and (y)
otherwise as to clauses (ii) and (iii), respectively, for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The execution and delivery of the Net-Lease Purchase
Agreement or the Bulwark Purchase Agreement, as the case may be, by any of the
Net-Lease Sellers did not, and the performance of the Net-Lease Purchase
Agreement or the Bulwark Purchase Agreement, as the case may be, by the Net-
Lease Sellers will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit
of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority.

 



 

 _Section 4.27_ _Transaction Expenses_. The expenses incurred or to be
incurred by Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to Closing in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not, as of

 _Section 5.12_ _Taxes_.

 



 

(a) Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has timely filed with the appropriate
Governmental Authority all material Tax Returns required to be filed, taking
into account any extensions of time within which to file such Tax Returns, and
all such Tax Returns were complete and correct in all material respects.
Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has duly paid (or there has been paid on its
behalf), or made adequate provisions in accordance with GAAP for, all material
Taxes required to be paid by it, whether or not shown on any Tax Return.

 



 

(b) Parent (i) for all taxable years commencing with Parents taxable year
ending December 31, 2009 and through December 31, 2013, has been subject to
taxation as a REIT and has satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT for
such years; (ii) has operated since January 1, 2014 to the date hereof, in a
manner consistent with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a
REIT; (iii) intends to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a
REIT for its taxable year that will include the day of the Merger; and (iv)
has not taken or omitted to take any action that could reasonably be expected
to result in a challenge by the IRS or any other Governmental Authority to its
status as a REIT, and, no such challenge is pending or threatened to the
Knowledge of Parent. No Parent Subsidiary is a corporation for United States
federal income tax purposes other than a corporation that qualifies as a
Qualified REIT Subsidiary or as a Taxable REIT Subsidiary. Parents dividends
paid deduction, within the meaning of Section 561 of the Code, for each
taxable year, taking into account any dividends subject to Sections 857(b)(9)
or 858 of the Code, has not been less than the sum of (x) Parents REIT
taxable income, as defined in Section 857(b)(2) of the Code, determined

other proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened with

Subsidiary; (ii) no material deficiency for Taxes of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary has been claimed, proposed or assessed in writing or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened, by any Governmental Authority, which
deficiency has not yet been settled except for such deficiencies which are
being contested in good faith or with respect to which the failure to pay,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect; (iii) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary
has waived any statute of limitations with respect to the assessment of
material Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to any material
Tax assessment or deficiency for any open tax year; (iv) neither Parent nor
any Parent Subsidiary currently is the beneficiary of any extension of time
within which to file any material Tax Return; and (v) neither Parent nor any
of the Parent Subsidiaries has entered into any "closing agreement" as
described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar
provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law).

 



 

(d) Each Parent Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture or limited
liability company and that has not elected to be a Taxable REIT Subsidiary has

case may be, and not as a corporation or an association taxable as a
corporation whose separate existence is respected for federal income tax
purposes.

previously paid, (ii) any liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b)(5) (for
income test violations), 856(c)(7)(C) (for asset test violations), or
856(g)(5)(C) (for violations of other qualification requirements applicable to
REITs) and (iii) none of Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has incurred any
material liability for Tax other than (A) in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, or (B) transfer or similar Taxes arising in
connection with sales of property. No event has occurred, and no condition or
circumstances exists, which presents a material risk that any material
liability for Taxes described in clause (i) or (iii) of the preceding sentence
or any liability for Taxes described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence
will be imposed upon Parent or any Parent Subsidiary.

 



 

(g) Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have complied, in all material
respects, with all applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of
Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445,
1446 and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under any state and foreign
Laws) and have duly and timely withheld and, in each case, have paid over to

with respect to or involving Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, and after the

7.2(a)_ to provide the other Party or the Representatives of such other Party
with access to or to disclose information (A) that is subject to the terms of
a confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date
of this Agreement or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (if Company or
Parent, as applicable, has used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
permission or consent of such third party to such disclosure), (B) the
disclosure of which would violate any Law applicable to such Party or any of
its Representatives or (C) that is subject to any attorney-client, attorney
work product or other legal privilege or would cause a risk of loss of
privilege to the disclosing Party. Each of Company and Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the
other Party that may result from the requests for access, data and information
hereunder. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and Company shall not,
and shall cause their respective Representatives and Affiliates not to,
contact or otherwise

 



   

     
 

 



 

communicate with parties with which the other Party has a business
relationship (including tenants/subtenants) regarding the business of such
other Party or this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby without
the prior written consent of such other Party ( _provided_ , that, for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 7.2(a)_ shall be deemed to
restrict Parent or Company and their respective Representatives and Affiliates
from contacting such parties in pursuing the business of Parent and Company
respectively operating in the ordinary course).

 



 

(b) Each of Company and Parent will hold, and will cause its respective
Representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including
any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 7.2_, in confidence to
the extent required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with,
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force
and effect pursuant to the terms thereof notwithstanding the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the termination thereof.

(a) Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, and
shall not authorize or permit any Representatives of Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
such Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect
to, or the announcement, making or completion of, any Company Acquisition
Proposal, or any inquiry, proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead
to any Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise
participate or engage in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person
other than Parent or its Representatives any non-public information or data in
connection with, any Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, recommend,
publicly declare advisable or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, share exchange agreement, consolidation agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement
in each case related to a Company Acquisition Proposal (other than a Company
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or requiring or having the effect of
requiring Company to abandon, terminate or violate its obligations hereunder
or fail to consummate the Merger (each, a " _Company Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ "), or (iv) agree to or propose publicly to do any of the
foregoing. Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Representatives of
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, (A) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions, negotiations and communications with any
Person and its Representatives (other than Parent or any of its
Representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any Company Acquisition
Proposal, (B) request the prompt return or destruction, to the extent required
by any confidentiality agreement, of all confidential information previously
furnished to any such Person and its Representatives, (C) terminate the access
of any such Person (other than Parent, its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective Representatives) to any "data room" hosted by Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives relating to any
Company Acquisition Proposal, and (D) not terminate, waive, amend, release or
modify, any provision of any confidentiality, standstill (including any
standstill provisions contained in any confidentiality or other agreement) or
any similar agreement to which it or any of its Affiliates, including the
Company Subsidiaries, or Representatives is a party, or any Takeover Statute,
or otherwise fail to enforce any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the

 



      
 

 



 

foregoing, if, at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (1) Company receives a written
Company Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board believes in good faith to
be bona fide, (2) such Company Acquisition Proposal was not the result of a
violation of this _Section 7.3(a)_, (3) the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with Companys outside counsel and financial
advisor) that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, and (4) the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with Companys outside counsel)
that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its duties under
applicable Law, subject to compliance with the other terms of this _Section
7.3_, Company may (and may authorize the Company Subsidiaries and its and
their Representatives to) (x) furnish non-public information with respect to
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such Company
Acquisition Proposal (and such Persons Representatives) pursuant to a Company
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that any non-public
information provided to any Person given such access shall have previously
been provided to Parent or shall be provided (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) to Parent prior to or concurrently with the time it is
provided to such Person and (y) participate in negotiations with the Person
making such Company Acquisition Proposal (and such Persons Representatives)
regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Company and its Representatives may contact in
writing any Person submitting a Company Acquisition Proposal after the date of
this Agreement (that was not the result of a violation of this _Section
7.3(a)_) solely to clarify the terms of a Company Acquisition Proposal for the
sole purpose of the Company Board informing itself about such Company
Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that Company shall have previously complied
with the provisions of _Section 7.3(f)_ with respect to providing Parent with
the information specified therein and shall have previously provided Parent
with a copy of any such written request for clarification at least twenty-four
(24) hours prior to the time that Company sends such written request to the
Person from whom Company received the unsolicited written Company Acquisition
Proposal. Company agrees that in the event any Representative of Company or
any Company Subsidiary takes any action which, if taken by Company, would
constitute a material violation of this _Section 7.3(a)_, then Company shall
be deemed to be in violation of this _Section 7.3(a)_ for all purposes of
this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Except as provided in _Sections 7.3(c)_ and _(d)_ , the Company Board (i)
shall not fail to make and shall not withdraw, withhold, modify or qualify in
any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub (or publicly propose to withdraw,
withhold, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub) the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Special
Committee or the Company Board of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) shall not adopt, approve, or
publicly recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable the adoption of any
Company Acquisition Proposal (each such action set forth in this _Section
7.3(b)_ being referred to herein as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ").

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in
circumstances not involving a Company Acquisition Proposal, subject to
compliance with _Section 7.3(e)_, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval the Company Board may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change if, and only if, after the date of this Agreement, the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with

 



      
 

 



 

Companys outside counsel) that (i) a Company Intervening Event has occurred
or arisen and (ii) the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its duties
under applicable Law.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, subject to
compliance with _Section 7.3(e)_, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change (and in the event that the Company Board determines such
Company Acquisition Proposal to be a Company Superior Proposal, in accordance
with this _Section 7.3_, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.1(d)(iii)_ (a " _Company Superior Proposal Termination_ ")), if and only if
(i) Company receives an unsolicited, written Company Acquisition Proposal that
the Company Board believes in good faith to be bona fide and that is not
withdrawn, (ii) such Company Acquisition Proposal was not the result of a
violation of _Section 7.3(a)_, (iii) the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with Companys outside counsel and financial
advisor) that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal, and (iv) the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with Companys outside counsel) that the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(e) Prior to effecting a Company Superior Proposal Termination or Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 7.3(c)_ or _(d)_ ,
(i) Company shall notify Parent in writing, at least four (4) Business Days
prior to taking such action (the " _Company Notice Period_ "), of its

and conditions of, and attach a complete copy of, such Company Superior
Proposal and the identity of the Person making such proposal, and (y) in
circumstances not involving or relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal,
specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor), (ii) during the Company
Notice Period, Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate)
to make such adjustments or modifications to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (x) such that, in circumstances involving or relating to a Company
Acquisition Proposal, the Company Superior Proposal ceases to be a Company
Superior Proposal, and (y) in circumstances not involving or relating to a
Company Acquisition Proposal, as may be proposed by Parent, and (iii) at the
end of the Company Notice Period, the Company Board must determine in good
faith that, (x) after consultation with Companys outside counsel and
financial advisor, in circumstances involving or relating to a Company
Acquisition Proposal, such Company Superior Proposal continues to constitute a
Company Superior Proposal (taking into account any adjustment or modification
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent), and that,
after consultation with Companys outside counsel, the failure to effect such
Company Superior Proposal Termination would be inconsistent with its duties
under applicable Law, and (y) after consultation with Companys outside
counsel, in circumstances not involving or relating to a Company Acquisition
Proposal, the failure to effect such Company Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
however, that in circumstances involving or relating to a Company Acquisition
Proposal, any material amendment to the financial terms (including without
limitation any change to the purchase price or form of consideration) or any
other material amendment of any such Company Superior Proposal during the
Company Notice Period shall require a new notice and Company Notice Period,
and Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this
_Section _

 



      
 

 



 

 _7.3(e)_ with respect to such new written notice, except that the new

negotiations with Company relating to a possible Company Acquisition Proposal.
Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in writing and shall include

providing a copy of all documentation or correspondence that supplements or
amends such Company Acquisition Proposal in any material respect. Without
limiting any of the foregoing, Company shall within one (1) Business Day
notify Parent orally and in writing if Company determines to begin providing
non-public information or to engage in negotiations concerning a Company
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ and shall in no event begin
providing such information or engaging in such discussions or negotiations
prior to providing such notice.

Company Board through its Representatives, directly or indirectly, from (i)
issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position thereunder or taking

obligations of Company specified in _Section 7.3(b)_ and the Company shall
not withdraw, modify or change the Company Board Recommendation in a manner

Change, unless the Company Board in connection with such communication
publicly states that its recommendation with respect to this Agreement and the

Recommendation Change.

officer, trustee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any indemnification
agreement or under the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, Parent Declaration
of Trust or Parent Bylaws or, if applicable, similar organizational documents
or agreements of any Company Subsidiary or Parent Subsidiary (with respect to
each such entity, the " _Organizational Documents_ "), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall: (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each person who is at the date hereof, was previously, or during the
period from the date hereof through the date of the Effective Time, serving as
a manager, director, officer, trustee or fiduciary, which for the avoidance of

pursuant to the terms of the Organizational Documents of the Company and the

acting in such capacity (collectively, the

 



   

     
 

 



 

" _Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by
applicable Law as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim and
any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Claim Expenses, judgments,
fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest,
assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect
of any thereof) relating to or resulting from such Claim; and (ii) promptly
pay on behalf of or, within ten (10) Business Days after any request for
advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent
authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, any
Claim Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or
otherwise participating with respect to any Claim in advance of the final
disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to
the Indemnified Party of any Claim Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party
in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification
and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other
security, but subject to (A) Parents and the Surviving Entitys receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such Claim
Expenses if it is ultimately determined under applicable Laws or any of the
Organizational Documents that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified and (B) a good faith affirmation by such Indemnified Party of such
Indemnified Partys compliance with the standard of conduct required herein;
_provided_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable for
any amounts paid in settlement effected without its prior written consent, as
applicable, and shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more
than one counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified
Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any
single Claim except to the extent the Indemnified Party is advised by counsel
that such Indemnified Party has conflicting interests with one or more other
Indemnified Parties in the outcome of such action (in which event such
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to engage separate counsel, the fees and
expenses for which the Surviving Entity shall be liable). The indemnification
and advancement obligations of the Surviving Entity pursuant to this _Section
7._ _6_ _(a)_ shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the
Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto (including with respect to any
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement,
the Merger and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the consideration and approval thereof and the process
undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto), and all
rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue
as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, trustee, employee,
agent, or fiduciary of Company or Parent or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
Parent Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to the benefit of
such persons heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. As used
in this _Section 7._ _6_ _(a)_ , (I) the term " _Claim_ " means any
threatened, asserted, pending or completed Action, suit or proceeding or
inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by any Party hereto, any
Governmental Authority or any other Person, that any Indemnified Party in good
faith believes might lead to the institution of any Action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other,
including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism,
arising out of or pertaining to (x) matters that relate to such Indemnified
Partys duties or service as a manager, director, officer, trustee, employee,
agent or fiduciary of Company or Parent or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
Parent Subsidiaries or, to the extent such person is or was serving at the
request or for the benefit of Company or Parent or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or Parent Subsidiaries, any other entity or any Benefit Plan
maintained by any of the foregoing at or prior to the Effective Time, and (y)

transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger; and (II) the term "
_Claim Expenses_ " means reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable
costs, expenses and obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses,

participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend,
be a witness in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is
authorized pursuant to this _Section 7._ _6_ _(a)_ , including any Action
relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an
Indemnified Party. The Surviving Entity shall not settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened Claim in
respect of which indemnification has been sought by an Indemnified Party
hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Claim, or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, the Surviving Entity agrees that all
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of
the current or former managers, directors, trustees, officers, agents or
fiduciaries or other Indemnified Parties as provided in the Organizational
Documents and the indemnification agreements of Company shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms. For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the
Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity and of any applicable Company
Subsidiary shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification and limitations on liability of directors and officers than
are set forth in the Organizational Documents of Company or any applicable
Company Subsidiary, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time
in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals
who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, trustees,
agents or fiduciaries of Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, unless
such modification shall be required by applicable Law and then only to the
minimum extent required by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Entity shall maintain in effect Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance covering each Person covered, on the date of this
Agreement, by Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy
for acts or omissions occurring prior to and through the Effective Time;
_provided_ , that in lieu of such obligation, (i) the Surviving Entity may
substitute therefor policies of an insurance company with the same or better
rating as Companys current insurance carrier the material terms of which,
including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect
to such directors and officers than Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof or (ii) in consultation with Parent, Company may obtain extended
reporting period coverage under Companys existing insurance programs (to be
effective as of the Effective Time) or purchase a "tail" policy for a period
of six (6) years after the Effective Time for a cost not in excess of the
Maximum Amount (as defined below); and _provided_ , _further_ , that in no
event shall the Surviving Entity be required to pay annual premiums for
insurance under this _Section 7.6(c)_ in excess of 300% of the most recent
annual premiums paid by Company prior to the date of this Agreement for such
purpose (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), it being understood that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Entity

 



      
 

 



 

shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained
for such Maximum Amount.

 



 

(d) If the Surviving Entity or its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges with or into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or transfers or conveys all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Entity shall assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 7._ _6_.

 



 

(e) The Surviving Entity shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 7._
_6_ ; _provided_ , that such Indemnified Party provides an undertaking to
repay such expenses if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not legally entitled
to indemnification under Law.

 



 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 7._ _6_ are intended to be for the
express benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party (who
are intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7._ _6_ ), his or her
heirs and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent, Company and the Surviving Entity and shall
not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Indemnified Party (including
his or her successors, assigns and heirs) without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party (including such successors, assigns and heirs) affected
thereby. The exculpation and indemnification provided for by this _Section
7._ _6_ shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which an
Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law, contract or
otherwise.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Company and Parent shall and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and

advisable registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental
Authorities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be

action or proceeding by, any Governmental Authority or other Persons necessary
in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) subject to _Section 7.8(c)_, the
defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger
or the other transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental
Authority vacated or reversed, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary or advisable to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement.

Affiliates that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that confidential
competitively sensitive business information may be redacted from such
exchanges. The Parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary, designate
any sensitive materials provided to the other under this _Section 7.7_ as
"outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, directors or
trustees of the recipient without the advance written consent of the Party
providing such materials. To the extent reasonably practicable, neither
Company nor Parent shall, nor shall they permit their respective
Representatives to, participate independently in any meeting or engage in any
substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other Party prior
notice of such meeting or conversation and, to the extent permitted by

respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , that no such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties
or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, Company and its Representatives shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent and its Representatives shall give prompt
notice to Company, if, to the Knowledge of such Party, the occurrence of any
state of facts, change, development, event or condition would cause, or would
reasonably be expected to cause, any of the conditions to Closing set forth
herein not to be satisfied or satisfaction to be materially delayed.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the failure by
Company, Parent or their respective Representatives to provide such prompt
notice under this _Section 7.8(b)_ shall not constitute a breach of covenant
for purposes of _Section 8.2(b)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_ or _Section
9.3(b)(i)(A)_ or _Section 9.3(c)(i)(A)_.

would reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. All Parties
shall treat the Merger as a tax-free "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of
the Code and no Party shall take any position for tax purposes inconsistent

that are reasonably acceptable to Parent (each an " _Alternative Net-Lease
Purchase Agreement_ ") and shall provide reasonable notice to Parent, and keep
Parent reasonably apprised of the status and expectations related to any
Alternative Net-Lease Purchase Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that an
Alternative Net-Lease Purchase Agreement shall be deemed to be reasonably

Business Day prior to the Outside Date, or (iii) impose any indemnification

Net-Lease Companies to, enter into a substitute Purchase Agreement with such
tenant (or any affiliate of such tenant) with respect to such property that is
reasonably acceptable to Parent (a " _Kick-Out Purchase Agreement_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that a Kick-Out Purchase Agreement shall be deemed to

and future directors, officers, employees, agents, general and limited
partners, managers, members, stockholders, Affiliates and assignees and each

the foregoing (collectively, the " _Company Parties_ ") in respect of this
Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith, and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including for any loss or damage suffered as
a result of the termination of this Agreement, the failure of the Merger to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder (whether
intentionally, unintentionally, or otherwise) or otherwise, and upon payment
of such Company Termination Fee, Net-Lease Termination Fee or Parent Expense
Amount no Company Party shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the existence of the
circumstances which could require the Company Termination Fee to become
subsequently payable by Company pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)(i)(A)_ shall not
relieve Company of its obligations to pay the amounts pursuant to _Section
9.3(b)(ii)_, _(iii)_ , or _(iv)_ in accordance with such Sections, and the
payment by Company pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)(ii)_, _(iii)_ , or _(iv)_ ,
shall not relieve Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the Company

event, Parent shall pay to Company an amount equal to the Company Expense

it being understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the

occasion. Subject to _Section 9.3(d)_, payment of the Parent Termination Fee
or Company Expense Amount, as applicable, shall be made by wire transfer of
same day funds to the account or accounts designated by Parent (i) at the time
of consummation of any transaction contemplated by a Parent Acquisition
Proposal, in the case of a Parent Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section
9.3(c)(i)(A)_, (ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable after termination
(and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days thereof), in the case of a
Parent Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)(i)(B)_, and (iii)
at the time of termination, in the case of a Parent Termination Fee payable
pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)(i)(C)_ and as a condition to the effectiveness of
such termination, as set forth in _Section 9.1(c)(iii)_, and (iv) as promptly
as reasonably practicable after termination (and, in any event, within two (2)
Business Days after receipt of documentation evidencing the Company Expense
Amount), in the case of the payment of the Company Expense Amount payable
pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)(ii)_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, except in the case of fraud or willful and material breach as
expressly set forth in _Section 9.2_ and except as set forth in the provisos
at the end of this sentence, in the event that the Parent Termination Fee or
Company Expense Amount becomes payable, then payment to Company of the Parent
Termination Fee or Company Expense Amount, shall be Companys sole and
exclusive remedy as liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages of
any nature against Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries and each of their
respective former, current and future directors, trustees, officers,
employees, agents, general and

 



      
 

 



 

limited partners, managers, members, shareholders, stockholders, Affiliates
and assignees and each former, current or future director, trustee, officer,
employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager, member, shareholder,
stockholder, Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing (collectively, the
" _Parent Parties_ ") in respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in
connection herewith, and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the termination of
this Agreement, the failure of the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or
failure to perform hereunder (whether intentionally, unintentionally, or
otherwise) or otherwise, and upon payment of such Parent Termination Fee or
Parent Expense Amount no Parent Party shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby; provided, however, that the existence of the
circumstances which could require the Parent Termination Fee to become
subsequently payable by Parent pursuant to Section _9.3(c)(i)(A)_ shall not
relieve Parent of its obligation to pay the Company Expense Amount pursuant to
_Section 9.3(c)(ii)_ in accordance with such Section, and the payment by
Parent pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)(ii)_, shall not relieve Parent of any
subsequent obligation to pay the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
9.3(c)(i)(A)_; and, _provided further_ , that in the event that Parent
previously has made a payment pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)(ii)_, the amount of
such payment actually made to Company shall be credited against any Parent
Termination Fee subsequently payable by Parent pursuant to _Section
9.3(c)(i)(A)_.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the amount of the
Parent Termination Fee, the Company Termination Fee, the Net-Lease Termination
Fee, the Parent Expense Amount or the Company Expense Amount (each a "
_Termination Payment_ ") payable to a Party (the " _Recipient_ ") pursuant to
this _Section 9.3_ in any taxable year of the Recipient shall not exceed the
sum (calculated for the Recipients taxable year in which such amount is
received) of (A) the amount that it is determined should not be gross income
to the Recipient for purposes of the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and
(3) of the Code, with such determination to be set forth in an opinion of
outside Tax counsel to the Recipient plus (B) such additional amount that it
is estimated can be paid to the Recipient in such taxable year without
creating a risk that the payment would cause the Recipient to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, determined as if the
payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), which determination
shall be made by independent Tax accountants to the Recipient, plus (C) if the
Recipient receives a letter from outside Tax counsel to the Recipient
indicating that (i) the Recipient has received a ruling from the IRS holding
that the Recipients receipt of the applicable Termination Payment either
would constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income of
the Recipient for purposes of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or (ii)
the Recipients outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect
that the receipt by the Recipient of the Termination Payment should either
constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income of the
Recipient for purposes of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, the
remaining balance of such Termination Payment. Any amount of any Termination
Payment that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as
soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing
limitation of this paragraph, _provided_ , that no such payment need be made
after the fifth anniversary of the date of termination. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Recipient shall cease to qualify as a REIT for federal
income tax purposes, the entire unpaid balance of any Termination Payment
shall be payable immediately.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Each of Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not
enter into this Agreement. If Company fails promptly to pay any amounts due
pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against Company for the amounts
set forth in _Section 9.3(b)_, Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in
_Sections 9.3(b)_ , from the date of termination of this Agreement at a rate
per annum equal to the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made (the " _Prime Rate_ "). If Parent fails
promptly to pay any amounts due pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)_, and, in order
to obtain such payment, Company commences a suit that results in a judgment
against Parent for the amounts set forth in _Section 9.3(c)_, Parent shall
pay to Company its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amounts set forth in _Section 9.3(c)_, from the date of
termination of this Agreement at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate.

 



 

 _Section 9.4_ _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Parties hereto by action
taken or authorized by the Company Special Committee and the Parent Board,
respectively, at any time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval or the Parent Shareholder Approval and prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , that after the Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent
Shareholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be (a) any amendment
of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of the consideration to
be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of Company Common Stock, or
which by applicable Law or, in the case of Parent, in accordance with the
rules of NYSE requires the further approval of the stockholders of Company or
shareholders of Parent without such further approval of such stockholders or
shareholders, or (b) any amendment or change not permitted under applicable
Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed by each of the Parties hereto.

 



 

 _Section 9.5_ _Transfer Taxes_. Parent and Company shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use,
transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any transfer, recording,
registration and other fees and any similar Taxes that become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together with
any related interests, penalties or additions to Tax, " _Transfer Taxes_ "),
and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes.
From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall pay or cause to
be paid, without deduction or withholding from any consideration or amounts
payable to holders of Company Common Stock, all Transfer Taxes.

 _Section 10.3_ _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present
or future Law or public policy in any jurisdiction, as to that jurisdiction,
(a) such term or other provision shall be fully separable, (b) this Agreement
shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) all other conditions and

for the provisions of _Article 3_ (which, from and after the Effective Time,
shall be for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time) and _Section 7.6_ (which, from and
after the Effective Time shall be for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties).
The representations and warranties in

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for
the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with _Section
10.7_ without notice or liability to any other person. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Accordingly, persons other than the parties
hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c)
subject to the requirements of applicable Law, waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the
part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure
of any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

 



 

 _Section 10.8_ _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims or causes of
actions (whether at Law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise
out of or be related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Maryland without giving effect to
its conflicts of laws principles (whether the State of Maryland or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Maryland.

 



 

 _Section 10.9_ _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each Party irrevocably agrees (a)
to submit itself to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal court located in
the State of Maryland or any Maryland State court (the " _Maryland Courts_ ")
for the purpose of any Action (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise),
directly or indirectly, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the actions of the parties
hereto in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement of this
Agreement, (b) that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c) that it will not
bring any Action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the actions of the parties hereto in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement of this Agreement in any court
other than the Maryland Courts, and (d) that a final judgment in any Action
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 



 

 _Section 10.10_ _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or delegated,

benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 10.11_ _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article 9_, each Party shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any
other remedy to which such Party is entitled at Law or in equity.

 



 

 _Section 10.12_ _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING,
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE
OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.12_.

 



 

 _Section 10.13_ _Authorship_. The Parties agree that the terms and language
of this Agreement are the result of negotiations between the Parties and their
respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that any
ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any Party. Any
controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without
regard to events of authorship or negotiation.

 



      
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be signed by
their respective duly authorized officers, all as of the date first written
above.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 



 

We are acting as counsel to the Special Committee to the Board of Inland
Diversified Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the
"Company"), in connection with the merger of the Company with and into K RG
Magellan, a Maryland limited liability company and a direct wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Kite Realty Group Trust, a Maryland real estate investment
trust (" _Merger Sub_ "), with Merger Sub as the surviving company in the
merger (the "Merger"). The Merger will be consummated pursuant to the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of , 2014 (the " _Merger
Agreement_ ") as more fully described in the registration statement on Form
S-4 (Registration No. 333- ) (the " _Registration Statement_ ")
containing the joint proxy statement/prospectus (the " _Joint Proxy Statement_
"). This opinion letter is being delivered pursuant to Section 8.2(e) of the
Merger Agreement. We are rendering this opinion letter regarding the
qualification of the Company as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under
Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"). All capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have
the same meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

 



 

In preparing this opinion letter, we have reviewed and are expressly relying
upon (without any independent investigation or review thereof) the truth and
accuracy of the factual statements, representations and warranties, and
covenants contained in (i) the Merger Agreement (including any exhibits and
schedules thereto), (ii) the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy
Statement, (iii) the tax representation letters of the Company delivered to us
for purposes of this opinion letter (the "Officers Certificate"), and (iv)
such other documents and corporate records as we have deemed necessary or
appropriate for purposes of this opinion letter or otherwise have considered
relevant to our analysis. Our opinion letter is based solely on the
information and representations in such documents.

 



 

For purposes of this opinion letter, we have assumed (i) the Merger will be
consummated in the manner contemplated by, and in accordance with the
provisions of, the Merger Agreement, the Registration Statement and the Joint
Proxy Statement, the Merger will be effective under the laws of the State of
Maryland and each of the parties to the Merger Agreement will comply with all
reporting obligations with respect to the Merger required under the Code and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder; (ii) the genuineness of all signatures on
documents we have examined; (iii) the authenticity of all documents submitted
to us as originals; (iv) the conformity to the original documents of all
documents submitted to us as copies; (v) the conformity, to the extent
relevant to our opinions, of final documents to all documents submitted to us
as drafts; (vi) the authority and capacity of the individual or individuals
who executed any such documents on behalf of any person; (vii) due execution
and delivery of all such documents by all the parties thereto; (viii) the
compliance of each party with all material provisions of such documents, and
(ix) the accuracy and completeness of all records made available to us.

 



 

Further, we have assumed, with your consent, that (i) the factual
representations set forth in the Officers Certificate and the description of
the Company and its subsidiaries and their activities in the

 



      
 

 



 

Registration Statement are true, accurate, complete and correct in all
respects up to and including the effective date of the Merger, and no actions
have been taken or will be taken which are inconsistent with such factual
statements, descriptions, representations, warranties, or covenants which make
any such descriptions, representations, warranties, or covenants untrue,
incomplete or incorrect as of the effective date of the Merger; (ii) the
Company and its subsidiaries will operate in a manner that will make the
representations contained in the Officers Certificate and the description of
the Company and its subsidiaries and their proposed activities in the
Registration Statement true for future periods through the effective date of
the Merger, (iii) the Company will not make any amendments to its
organizational documents after the date of this opinion that would affect the
Companys qualification as a REIT for any taxable year; (iv) no action will be
taken after the date hereof by the Company or any of its subsidiaries that
would have the effect of altering the facts upon which the opinion set forth
below is based; (v) all factual statements, descriptions, representations,
warranties, and covenants contained in any of the documents referred to herein
(including, without limitation, the Officers Certificate) or otherwise made
to us are true, complete and correct in all respects and will remain true,
complete and correct in all respects up to and including the effective date of
the Merger, and no actions have been taken or will be taken which are
inconsistent with such factual statements, descriptions, representations,
warranties, or covenants which make any such descriptions, representations,
warranties, or covenants untrue, incomplete or incorrect as of the effective
date of the Merger; (vi) any statements, representations or warranties made in
any of the documents referred to herein qualified as to knowledge or belief or
similarly qualified are true, complete and correct in all respects and will
continue to be true, complete and correct in all respects at all times up to
and including the effective date of the Merger, in each case without such
qualification; and (vii) each of the parties to the Merger Agreement will
comply with all reporting obligations with respect to the Merger required
under the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

 



 

Any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any of the aforementioned statements,
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or assumptions, could
adversely affect our opinions. In particular, the failure of any of the
aforementioned statements, representations, warranties, covenants, agreements
or assumptions to be true as of the effective date of the Merger could cause
the opinions set forth below to be invalid. Similarly, any change in
applicable law between the date hereof and the effective date of the Merger
could also cause the opinions set forth below to be invalid. No ruling has
been or will be sought from the Internal Revenue Service by any party to the
Merger Agreement as to the United States federal income tax consequences of
any aspect of the Merger.

 



 

For purposes of our opinions set forth herein, although we have discussed the
Officers Certificate with the signatories thereto, we have not made an
independent investigation of the facts, representations, and covenants set
forth in the Officers Certificate, the Registration Statement, or in any
other document. Consequently, we have assumed, and relied on your
representations, that the information presented in the Officers Certificate,
the Registration Statement, and other documents accurately and completely
describe all material facts relevant to our opinion. We have assumed that such
representations are true without regard to any qualification as to knowledge
or belief. Our opinions are conditioned on the continuing accuracy and
completeness of such statements, representations and covenants. Any material
change or inaccuracy in the facts referred to, set forth, or assumed herein or
in the Officers Certificate may affect our conclusions set forth herein.

 



 

The opinions expressed herein are given as of the date hereof and are based
upon the Code, the U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, current
administrative positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and existing
judicial decisions, any of which could be changed at any time, possibly on a
retroactive basis. Any such changes could adversely affect the opinions
rendered herein. In addition, as noted above, our opinions are based solely on
the documents that we have examined and the representations that have been
made to us and cannot be relied upon if any of the facts contained in such
documents or in such additional information is, or later becomes, inaccurate
or if any of the

 



      
 

 



 

representations made to us are, or later become, inaccurate. We are not aware,
however, of any facts or circumstances contrary to or inconsistent with the
information, assumptions, and representations we have relied on for purposes
of this opinion. Our opinions are limited to the U.S. federal income tax
matters specifically covered herein. We have not opined on any other tax
consequences to the Company or any other person. Further, we express no
opinion with respect to other federal laws or the laws of any other
jurisdiction.

 



 

Based on the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set
forth herein, we are of the opinion that for all taxable periods commencing
with its taxable year ended December 31, 2009 and ending with its taxable year
that ends with the Merger, the Company has been organized and has operated in
conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT
under the Code.

 



 

Our opinion does not preclude the possibility that the Company may have to
utilize one or more of the various "savings provisions" under the Code that
would permit the Company to cure certain violations of the requirements for
qualification and taxation as a REIT. Utilizing any savings provisions could
require the Company to pay significant penalty or excise taxes.

 



 

An opinion of counsel merely represents counsels best judgment with respect
to the probable outcome on the merits and is not binding on the Internal
Revenue Service or the courts. There can be no assurance that positions
contrary to our opinion will not be taken by the Internal Revenue Service or
that a court considering the issues would not hold contrary to our opinion.

 



 

No opinions other than those expressly contained herein may be inferred or
implied. Also, we undertake no obligation to update this opinion letter, or to
ascertain after the date hereof whether circumstances occurring after such
date may affect the conclusions set forth herein.

 



 

This opinion letter is being furnished to you in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. This opinion letter may not
be relied on by any other person or for any other purpose without our prior
written consent.

Very truly yours,

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 



 

This opinion letter is being delivered to you in connection with the merger
(the "Merger") of Inland Diversified Real Estate Trust, Inc., a Maryland
corporation ("Inland"), with and into KRG Magellan, LLC, a Maryland limited
liability company ("Merger Sub") and wholly-owned subsidiary of Kite Realty
Group Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust ("Kite"), with Merger Sub
surviving the Merger, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger,
and the exhibits thereto, by and among Kite, Merger Sub, and Inland, dated as
of February , 2014 (the "Merger Agreement"), as more fully described in
the registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. - )
containing the consent solicitation/information statement/prospectus of Kite
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
, 2014, as amended through the date hereof (the "Registration Statement").
This opinion letter is being delivered to you pursuant to Section 8.2(f) of
the Merger Agreement. Capitalized terms used herein and which are defined in
the Merger Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement
unless otherwise defined herein.

 



 

In connection with the preparation of this opinion letter, we have examined,
and with your consent relied upon, without any independent investigation or
review thereof, the following documents (including all exhibits and schedules
thereto): (1) the Merger Agreement; (2) the Registration Statement; (3)
officers certificates delivered by each of Kite and Inland, both dated as of
the date hereof (the "Tax Certificates"); and (4) such other instruments and
documents related to the formation, organization, and operation of Kite and
Inland or to the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated
thereby as we have deemed necessary or appropriate (the documents described in
clauses (1) through (4), collectively the "Reviewed Documents"). In addition,
we have reviewed the form of opinion of counsel to be delivered to Inland by
Alston and Bird LLP pursuant to Section 8.3(f) of the Merger Agreement
concurrently herewith (the "AandB Opinion").

 



 

 _Assumptions and Representations_

 



 

In connection with rendering this opinion, we have assumed or obtained
representations (which with your consent we are relying upon, and upon which
our opinion is premised, without any independent investigation or review
thereof), including that:

 



      
 

 



 

1. (A) All information contained in each of the documents we have examined and upon which we have relied in connection with the preparation of this opinion is accurate and completely describes all material facts relevant to our opinion, (B) all copies are accurate, (C) all signatures are genuine, and (D) all documents have been or will be, as the case may be, timely and properly executed.

 



 

2. There will have been, by the Effective Time, or at such other time as contemplated in the Merger Agreement, due execution and delivery of all documents, where due execution and delivery are prerequisites to the effectiveness thereof.

 



 

3. To the extent relevant to our opinion, all representations, warranties, and statements made or agreed to by Kite and Merger Sub, and by Inland, their respective managements, employees, officers, directors, and stockholders in connection with the Merger, including, but not limited to, those in the Reviewed Documents (including the Tax Certificates but, for these purposes, not including the Registration Statement), have been and will continue to be true, complete, and accurate in all respects; any representation or statement made in the Tax Certificates "to the best of knowledge," "to the knowledge," or "to the actual knowledge" of any person(s) or party(ies)  or similarly qualified  is true, correct, and complete, as if made without such qualification.

 



 

4. All representations, warranties, and statements made or agreed to by Kite and Merger Sub, and by Inland, and by their respective managements, employees, officers, directors, and stockholders in the Registration Statement, insofar as they relate to tax matters or the Merger and/or any other action or transaction to be undertaken in connection with or pursuant to the Merger Agreement, have been and will continue to be true, complete, and accurate in all respects.

 



 

5. The Merger Agreement is valid and binding in accordance with its terms. The Merger will be consummated in accordance with the Merger Agreement (including satisfaction of all pre-closing covenants and conditions to the obligations of the parties, without amendment, waiver, or breach thereof) and as described in the Registration Statement.

Commencing not later than its taxable year ended December 31, 2004, Kite has qualified as a real estate investment trust (a "REIT") under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and will continue to qualify as a REIT under the Code for its taxable year which includes the Effective Time and thereafter.

 



 

7. Commencing not later than its taxable year ended December 31, 2009 and ending with its taxable year that ends with the Merger, Inland has qualified as a REIT under the Code.

 



 

8. Each of Kite and Inland will comply with all reporting obligations with respect to the Merger required under the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

 



 

9. The AandB Opinion is being delivered to Inland concurrently herewith in the form provided to us, and the AandB Opinion has not been and will not be modified or withdrawn.

 



 

 _Opinion_

 



 

Based upon and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth herein,
we are of the opinion that the Merger, when effective, will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



 

In addition to the assumptions set forth above, this opinion is subject to the
exceptions, limitations, and qualifications set forth below:

 



      
 

 



 

1. The opinion set forth in this letter is based on relevant current provisions of the Code, the Treasury Regulations thereunder (including proposed and temporary Treasury Regulations), and interpretations of the foregoing as expressed in court decisions, applicable legislative history, and the administrative rulings and practices of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), including its practices and policies in issuing private letter rulings, which are not binding on the IRS except with respect to a taxpayer that receives such a ruling, all as of the date hereof. These provisions and interpretations are subject to change by the IRS, Congress, and the courts (as applicable), which change may or may not be retroactive in effect and which might result in material modifications of our opinion. Our opinion does not foreclose the possibility of a contrary determination by the IRS or a court of competent jurisdiction, nor of a contrary position taken by the IRS or the Treasury Department in regulations or rulings issued in the future. In this regard, an opinion of counsel with respect to an issue represents counsels best professional judgment with respect to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, if such issue were to be litigated, but an opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a position asserted by the IRS. Neither Kite nor Inland has requested or will request a ruling from the IRS as to any of the U.S. federal income tax consequences addressed in this opinion. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that future legislative, judicial, or administrative changes, including on a retroactive basis, would not adversely affect the accuracy of the opinion expressed herein.

 



 

2. This letter addresses only the specific tax opinion set forth above. Our opinion does not address any other U.S. federal, state, local, or non-U.S. tax consequences that will or may result from the Merger or any other transaction (including any transaction undertaken in connection with the Merger or contemplated by the Merger Agreement).

 



 

3. Our opinion set forth herein is based upon, among other things, the description of the contemplated transactions (including the Merger) as set forth in the Registration Statement. No opinion is expressed as to any transaction other than those set forth in the Merger Agreement and the Registration Statement, or to any transaction whatsoever, including the Merger, unless all the transactions described in the Merger Agreement and the Registration Statement (or otherwise contemplated in connection with the Merger) have been consummated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement (and also without amendment, waiver, or breach of any provision thereof) and the description thereof set forth in the Registration Statement, and also unless all of the representations, warranties, statements, and assumptions upon which we have relied are true, complete, and accurate at all times. In the event that the actual facts relating to any aspect of the relevant transactions (including the Merger) differ from the terms of the Merger Agreement (without amendment, waiver, or breach of any material provision thereof) or the descriptions set forth in the Registration Statement, or if any one of the representations, warranties, statements, or assumptions upon which we have relied to issue this opinion is incorrect, our opinion might be adversely affected and may not be relied upon.

 



 

This opinion letter has been prepared solely for your use in connection with
the Merger and speaks as of the date hereof. We undertake no responsibility to
advise you or any other person by reason of this opinion letter or otherwise
to advise you of any changes in our opinion subsequent to the delivery of this
opinion letter. This opinion letter may not be relied on by any other person,
or for any other purpose, without our prior written consent, which may be
withheld in our sole discretion. This opinion letter may not be distributed,
quoted in whole or in part or otherwise reproduced in any document, or filed
with any governmental agency without our prior written consent.

 



      
 

 



 

 **To comply with the Internal Revenue Service Circular 230, you are hereby
notified that: (A) this opinion letter is not intended or written by us to be
used, and cannot be used by any taxpayer (including the addressee), for the
purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on any such taxpayer under
the Code; (B) this opinion letter is written to support the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and (C) any taxpayer (including the
addressee of this letter) should seek advice based on the taxpayers
particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor.**

Inland Diversified Real Estate Trust, Inc.

 

2901 Butterfield Road

 

Oak Brook, Illinois 60523

 



 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 



 

We have acted as tax counsel to Kite Realty Group Trust, a Maryland real
estate investment trust (the "Company"), in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February ,
2014 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among the Company, KRG Magellan, LLC, a
Maryland limited liability company (the "Merger Sub"), and Inland Diversified
Real Estate Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Inland"). This opinion
letter is being delivered to you pursuant to Section 8.3(e) of the Merger
Agreement. Capitalized terms used herein which are defined in the Merger
Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement, unless
otherwise defined herein.

 



 

 **Bases for Opinion**

 



 

The opinion set forth in this letter is based on relevant current provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), Treasury
Regulations thereunder (including proposed and temporary Treasury
Regulations), and interpretations of the foregoing as expressed in court
decisions, applicable legislative history, and the administrative rulings and
practices of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), including its practices
and policies in issuing private letter rulings, which are not binding on the
IRS except with respect to a taxpayer that receives such a ruling, all as of
the date hereof. These provisions and interpretations are subject to change by
the IRS, Congress and the courts (as applicable), which may or may not be
retroactive in effect and which might result in material modifications of our
opinion. Our opinion does not foreclose the possibility of a contrary
determination by the IRS or a court of competent jurisdiction, or of a
contrary position taken by the IRS or the Treasury Department in regulations
or rulings issued in the future. In this regard, an opinion of counsel with
respect to an issue represents counsels best professional judgment with
respect to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, if such issue
were to be litigated, but an opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts,
and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with
respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a position
asserted by the IRS.

 



 

In rendering the following opinion, we have examined such statutes,
regulations, records, agreements, certificates and other documents as we have
considered necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion, including but
not limited to the following documents (including exhibits and schedules
thereto) which we have, with your consent, relied upon (without any
independent investigation or review thereof):

 



      
 

 



 

(1) the Registration Statement on Form S-4 (File No. - )
containing the consent solicitation/information statement/prospectus of the
Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
, 2014 (the "Proxy");

 



 

(2) the Merger Agreement;

 



 

(3) certain organizational documents of the Company and its subsidiaries; and

 



 

(4) such other documents as we deemed necessary or appropriate (those
documents referred to in clauses (1) through (4), the "Reviewed Documents").

 



 

The opinion set forth in this letter is premised on, among other things, the
written representations of the Company and Kite Realty Group, L.P., a Delaware
limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership"), contained in a letter to us
dated as of the date hereof (the "Kite Representation Letter") and in a letter
from Inland to us and the Company pursuant to Section 7.15(a) of the Merger
Agreement dated as of the date hereof (the "Inland Representation Letter," and
together with the Kite Representation Letter, the "Representation Letters").
Although we have discussed the Kite Representation Letter with the signatories
thereto, for purposes of rendering our opinion we have not made an independent
investigation or audit of the facts set forth in the Reviewed Documents or the
Representation Letters. We consequently have relied upon the representations
and statements of the Company and the Operating Partnership as described in
the Reviewed Documents and the Kite Representation Letter, and of Inland in
the Inland Representation Letter, and assumed that the information presented
in such documents or otherwise furnished to us is accurate and complete in all
material respects. We are not aware, however, of any facts or circumstances
contrary to or inconsistent with the representations and statements as to
factual matters set forth in Reviewed Documents or the Kite Representation
Letter.

 



 

In this regard, we have assumed with your consent the following:

 



 

(1) that (A) all of the representations and statements as to factual matters
set forth in the Reviewed Documents and the Representation Letters are true,
correct, and complete as of the date hereof, (B) any representation or
statement in the Reviewed Documents and the Representation Letters made as a
belief or made "to the knowledge of" or similarly qualified is true, correct,
and complete as of the date hereof, without such qualification, (C) each
agreement described in the Reviewed Documents is valid and binding in
accordance with its terms, and (D) each of the obligations of the Company, and
its subsidiaries, as described in the Reviewed Documents, has been or will be
performed or satisfied in accordance with its terms;

 



 

(2) the genuineness of all signatures, the proper execution of all documents,
the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity
to originals of documents submitted to us as copies, and the authenticity of
the originals from which any copies were made;

 



 

(3) that any documents as to which we have reviewed only a form were or will
be duly executed without material changes from the form reviewed by us;

 



 

(4) the Merger Agreement is valid and binding in accordance with its terms;

 



 

(5) the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the Merger Agreement
(including satisfaction of all pre-closing covenants and conditions to the
obligations of the parties without amendment, waiver, or breach thereof);

 



      
 

 



 

(6) from and after the date of this letter, the Company will comply with its
representation contained in the Kite Representation Letter that the Company
will utilize all appropriate "savings provisions" (including the provisions of
Sections 856(c)(6), 856(c)(7), and 856(g) of the Code, and the provision
included in Section 856(c)(4) of the Code (flush language) allowing for the
disposal of assets within 30 days after the close of a calendar quarter, and
all available deficiency dividend procedures) available to the Company under
the Code in order to correct any violations of the applicable real estate
investment trust ("REIT") qualification requirements of Sections 856 and 857
of the Code, to the full extent the remedies under such provisions are
available; and

 



 

(7) that Inland qualified to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for all taxable
periods commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2009 and ending
with its taxable year that ends with the Merger.

 



 

Any material variation or difference in the facts from those set forth in the
documents that we have reviewed and upon which we have relied (including, in
particular, the Proxy and the Representation Letters) may adversely affect the
conclusions stated herein.

 



 

 **Opinion**

 



 

Based upon and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth herein,
including, without limitation, the discussion in the next two paragraphs
below, we are of the opinion that the Company has been organized and has
operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as
a REIT under the Code for each of its taxable years beginning with its taxable
year ended December 31, 2004, and the Companys current organization and
current and proposed method of operation (as described in the Proxy and the
Kite Representation Letter) will enable it to meet the requirements for
qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code for its taxable year which
includes the Effective Time and thereafter.

 



 

The Companys qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code will depend
upon the ability of the Company to meet on an ongoing basis (through actual
quarterly and annual operating results, distribution levels, diversity of
share ownership and otherwise) the various qualification tests imposed under
the Code, and upon the Company utilizing any and all appropriate "savings
provisions" (including the provisions of Sections 856(c)(6), 856(c)(7), and
856(g) of the Code and the provision included in Section 856(c)(4) of the Code
(flush language) allowing for the disposal of assets within 30 days after the
close of the calendar quarter, and all available deficiency dividend
procedures) available to the Company under the Code to correct violations of
specified REIT qualification requirements of Sections 856 and 857 of the Code.
Our opinion set forth above does not foreclose the possibility that the
Company may have to utilize one or more of these "savings provisions" in the
future, which could require the Company to pay an excise or penalty tax (which
could be significant in amount) in order to maintain its REIT qualification.
We have not undertaken at this time to review the Companys compliance with
these requirements on a continuing basis, nor will we do so in the future.
Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of the
Companys operations, the sources of its income, the nature of its assets, the
level of its distributions to shareholders and the diversity of its share
ownership for any given taxable year will satisfy the requirements under the

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 



 

This letter is being provided to you in connection with the merger of Inland
Diversified Real Estate Trust, Inc. ("the Company"), with and into KRG
Magellan, LLC, a Maryland limited liability company and a direct wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Kite Realty Group Trust (" _Merger Sub_ "), with Merger Sub
as the surviving company in the merger (the "Merger"). The Merger will be
consummated pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
, 2014 (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") as more fully described in the
registration statement on Form S-4 (Registration No. 333- )
(the " _Registration Statement_ ") containing the joint proxy
statement/prospectus (the " _Joint Proxy Statement_ "). This opinion letter is
being delivered in connection with the joint proxy statement/prospectus (the "
_Joint Proxy Statement_ ") included in the registration statement on Form S-4
(Registration No. - ) (the " _Registration Statement_ ")
and pursuant to Section 8.3(f) of the Merger Agreement. We are rendering this
opinion letter regarding the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "). All capitalized terms used herein and not defined
herein shall have the same meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

 



 

In preparing this opinion letter, we have reviewed and are expressly relying
upon (without any independent investigation or review thereof) the truth and
accuracy of the factual statements, representations and warranties, and
covenants contained in (i) the Merger Agreement (including any exhibits and
schedules thereto), (ii) the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy
Statement, (iii) the tax representation letters of the Company delivered to us
for purposes of this opinion letter (the "Officers Certificate"), and (iv)
such other documents and corporate records as we have deemed necessary or
appropriate for purposes of this opinion letter or otherwise have considered
relevant to our analysis. Our opinion letter is based solely on the
information and representations in such documents.

 



 

For purposes of this opinion letter, we have assumed (i) the Merger will be
consummated in the manner contemplated by, and in accordance with the
provisions of, the Merger Agreement, the Registration Statement and the Joint
Proxy Statement, the Merger will be effective under the laws of the State of
Maryland and each of the parties to the Merger Agreement will comply with all
reporting obligations with respect to the Merger required under the Code and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder; (ii) the genuineness of all signatures on
documents we have examined; (iii) the authenticity of all documents submitted
to us as originals; (iv) the conformity to the original documents of all
documents submitted to us as copies; (v) the conformity, to the extent
relevant to our opinions, of final documents to all documents submitted to us
as drafts; (vi) the authority and capacity of the individual or individuals
who executed any such documents on behalf of any person; (vii) due execution
and delivery of all such documents by all the parties thereto; (viii) the
compliance of each party with all material provisions of such documents, and
(ix) the accuracy and completeness of all records made available to us.

 



      
 

 



 

Further, we have assumed, with your consent, that (i) the factual
representations set forth in the Officers Certificate and the description of
the Company and its subsidiaries and their activities in the Registration
Statement are true, accurate and complete in all respects up to and including
the effective date of the Merger, and no actions have been taken or will be
taken which are inconsistent with such factual statements, descriptions,
representations, warranties, or covenants which make any such descriptions,
representations, warranties, or covenants untrue, incomplete or incorrect as
of the effective date of the Merger; (ii) the Company and its subsidiaries
will operate in a manner that will make the representations contained in the
Officers Certificate and the description of the Company and its subsidiaries
and their proposed activities in the Registration Statement true for future
periods through the effective date of the Merger, (iii) the Company will not
make any amendments to its organizational documents after the date of this
opinion that would affect the Companys qualification as a REIT for any
taxable year; (iv) no action will be taken after the date hereof by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries that would have the effect of altering the
facts upon which the opinion set forth below is based; (v) all factual
statements, descriptions, representations, warranties, and covenants contained
in any of the documents referred to herein (including, without limitation, the
Officers Certificates) or otherwise made to us are true, complete and correct
in all respects and will remain true, complete and correct in all respects up
to and including the effective date of the Merger, and no actions have been
taken or will be taken which are inconsistent with such factual statements,
descriptions, representations, warranties, or covenants which make any such
descriptions, representations, warranties, or covenants untrue, incomplete or
incorrect as of the effective date of the Merger; (vi) any statements,
representations or warranties made in any of the documents referred to herein
qualified as to knowledge or belief or similarly qualified are true, complete
and correct in all respects and will continue to be true, complete and correct
in all respects at all times up to and including the effective date of the
Merger, in each case without such qualification; and (vii) each of the parties
to the Merger Agreement will comply with all reporting obligations with
respect to the Merger required under the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder.

 



 

Any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any of the aforementioned statements,
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or assumptions, or any
change after the date hereof in applicable law, could adversely affect our
opinions. In particular, the failure of any of the aforementioned statements,
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or assumptions to be true
as of the effective date of the Merger could cause the opinions set forth
below to be invalid. Similarly, any change in applicable law between the date
hereof and the effective date of the Merger could also cause the opinions set
forth below to be invalid. No ruling has been or will be sought from the
Internal Revenue Service by any party to the Merger Agreement as to the United
States federal income tax consequences of any aspect of the Merger.

 



 

For purposes of our opinions set forth herein, we have not made an independent
investigation of the facts, representations, and covenants set forth in the
Officers Certificate, the Registration Statement, or in any other document.
Consequently, we have assumed, and relied on your representations, that the
information presented in the Officers Certificate, the Registration
Statement, and other documents accurately and completely describe all material
facts relevant to our opinion. We have assumed that such representations are
true without regard to any qualification as to knowledge or belief. Our
opinions are conditioned on the continuing accuracy and completeness of such
statements, representations and covenants. Any material change or inaccuracy
in the facts referred to, set forth, or assumed herein or in the Officers
Certificate may affect our conclusions set forth herein.

 



 

The opinions expressed herein are given as of the date hereof and are based
upon the Code, the U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, current
administrative positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and existing
judicial decisions, any of which could be changed at any time, possibly on a
retroactive basis. Any such changes could adversely affect the opinions
rendered herein. In addition, as noted above, our opinions are based solely on
the documents that we have examined and the representations that have been
made to us and cannot be relied upon if any of the facts contained in such

 



      
 

 



 

documents or in such additional information is, or later becomes, inaccurate
or if any of the representations made to us are, or later become, inaccurate.
We are not aware, however, of any facts or circumstances contrary to or
inconsistent with the information, assumptions, and representations we have
relied on for purposes of this opinion. Our opinions are limited to the U.S.
federal income tax matters specifically covered herein. We have not opined on
any other tax consequences to the Company or any other person. Further, we
express no opinion with respect to other federal laws or the laws of any other
jurisdiction.

 



 

Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, for United States federal
income tax purposes, the Merger, when effective, will be treated as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of Code, as in effect on
the date hereof.

 



 

An opinion of counsel merely represents counsels best judgment with respect
to the probable outcome on the merits and is not binding on the Internal
Revenue Service or the courts. There can be no assurance that positions
contrary to our opinion will not be taken by the Internal Revenue Service or
that a court considering the issues would not hold contrary to our opinion.

 



 

No opinions other than those expressly contained herein may be inferred or
implied. Also, we undertake no obligation to update this opinion letter, or to
ascertain after the date hereof whether circumstances occurring after such
date may affect the conclusions set forth herein.

 



 

This opinion letter is being furnished to you in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. This opinion letter may not
be relied on by any other person or for any other purpose without our prior
written consent.
