accordance with it and any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
contemplated transaction shall be governed by and construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of law rules that would direct
application of the laws of another jurisdiction (except to the extent that the laws of another
state mandatorily apply to the conveyance hereunder of Real Property located within such state).
With respect to any suit, action or proceeding to which any Lending Source is a party, each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (a)&nbsp;submits, for itself and its property, to
the exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or Federal court of the United States of
America sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City, and any appellate court from any
thereof, and agrees that all claims in respect of any such suit, action or proceeding may be heard
and determined only in such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such
Federal court, (b)&nbsp;waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any New York State court or in any such Federal court, (c)&nbsp;waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such suit,
action or proceeding in any such court, and (d)&nbsp;agrees that a final judgment in any such suit,
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law. EACH PARTY, KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, AND
INTENTIONALLY, WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTION, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE,
INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH PROCEEDING TO WHICH ANY LENDING SOURCE IS A PARTY.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.02 <B><I>Entire Agreement. </I></B>This Agreement (including the documents, schedules, attachments,
exhibits, annexes and instruments referred to herein and therein) together with the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior agreements,
documents or other instruments with respect to the matters covered hereby. The Parties make, and
have made, no oral agreements or undertakings pertaining to the subject matter of this Agreement.
In the event of any irreconcilable conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any
conveyancing documents contemplated hereby, the terms of this Agreement shall be controlling.
Buyer and Seller agree that the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate effective upon the
Closing.

be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor
shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.
