 (g) Should Buyer dispute any amount shown as payable by Buyer or payable by Seller under the Settlement Statement, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a written report (the _"Objection Report"_ ) containing any changes that Buyer proposes to be made to the Settlement Statement no later than thirty (30) days after Buyers receipt of the Settlement Statement. If Buyer provides a notice of agreement or does not deliver an Objection Report to Seller within such 30-day period, then Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted the calculations and amounts set forth in the Settlement Statement delivered by Seller, which shall then be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event Buyer does deliver an Objection Report to Seller within such 30-day period, Buyer and Seller shall undertake to agree upon a final resolution of the amounts owing under the Settlement Statement not later than 150 days after the Closing Date should Buyer dispute any amount thereunder. If Buyer timely proposes changes to the Settlement Statement and thereafter Seller and Buyer are unable to agree upon the final resolution Settlement Statement within 150 days after the Closing Date, a mutually acceptable, nationally recognized, accounting firm not performing services for either Buyer or Seller shall be designated to act as an arbitrator and to decide all points of disagreement with respect to the 

   ##### 

  

 

Settlement Statement, such decision to be binding upon both Parties. The costs
and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by Seller and Buyer
pursuant to the arbitrators standard engagement letter. If the Settlement
Statement, after resolution of all disputes, reflects an amount due to
Seller, Buyer shall, within five (5) Business Days, pay to Seller in
immediately available funds such amount, less any amounts already paid under
Section 3.01(f). If the Settlement Statement, after resolution of all
disputes, reflects an amount due to Buyer, Seller, shall within five (5)
Business Days, pay to Buyer, in immediately available funds such amount,
less any amounts already paid under Section 3.01(f). 

   

 3.02 _New BP Contract._ The Parties acknowledge and agree that Seller is in the process of negotiating with BP a definitive gas gathering and processing agreement with respect to the Texas System (the " _New BP Contract_ "). Seller shall before Closing, and Seller and Buyer shall jointly after Closing, in good faith, continue such negotiations with BP and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts and reasonable diligence to finalize the New BP Contract with BP by the 180th day after the Closing Date (the " _BP Contract Deadline_ "), with such terms and conditions as are normal and customary for contracts of such nature; _provided, however,_ that Buyer shall have the right to consent to and approve the New BP Contract prior to Closing pursuant to Section 4.02(d), such consent and approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the Parties finalize any New BP Contract with BP on or before the BP Contract Deadline, Buyer shall execute such New BP Contract as soon as possible, but not earlier than the Closing Date or later than the BP Contract Deadline, and (i) if such New BP Contract contains Gross Margin Actual Terms that are equal to or greater than the Gross Margin Expected Terms, Buyer shall pay Seller the BP Additional Payment Amount, within five (5) Business Days after execution of the New BP Contract, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to bank accounts designated in writing by Seller to Buyer, or (ii) if such New BP Contract contains Gross Margin Actual Terms that are less than the Gross Margin Expected Terms, Buyer shall pay Seller a portion of the BP Additional Payment Amount, within five (5) Business Days after execution of the New BP Contract, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to bank accounts designated in writing by Seller to Buyer determined as follows: 

  

 (a) Seller shall be entitled to receive the amount (the " _BP Contract Value_ ") equal to the product of the BP Additional Payment Amount multiplied by a fraction, expressed as a percentage, the numerator of which is the Gross Margin Actual Terms and the denominator of which is the Gross Margin Expected Terms; and 

  

 (b) Buyer shall be entitled to retain the remainder of the BP Additional Payment Amount. 

 

A simplified example of calculation of the BP Contract Value is set forth on
_Exhibit K_ attached hereto. However, if the Parties fail to finalize the
New BP Contract with BP on or before the BP Contract Deadline, Buyer shall
retain the BP Additional Payment Amount, unless such failure is caused by a
breach by Buyer of its obligations under this Section to use commercially
reasonable efforts and reasonable diligence to finalize the New BP Contract
by the BP Contract Deadline, in which event the BP Contract Deadline shall be
extended for an additional one hundred eighty (180) days after the BP
Contract Deadline _._  

       ##### 

  

     

 3.03 _Allocation of Purchase Price._ The Purchase Price shall be allocated among the assets of Seller in accordance with _Schedule 3.03 _(the " _Allocation_ "). Seller and Buyer shall report the transaction contemplated hereby on all Tax Returns, including, but not limited to Form 8594, in a manner consistent with the Allocation. After Closing, if the adjusted purchase price (as computed under the Settlement Statement and Sections 3.01(f) and (g)) differs from the initial purchase price (as computed under Section 3.01(a)) and if such difference requires an adjustment to the Allocation in order for such Allocation to comply with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, Seller shall prepare such adjustment to the Allocation which adjustment shall be submitted to Buyer, and Seller and Buyer shall use their reasonable efforts to agree on the final adjustment within thirty (30) days after the determination of the adjusted purchase price. Buyer shall timely and properly prepare, execute, file, and deliver all such documents, forms, and other information as Seller may reasonably request in preparing any required adjustment to the Allocation. If, contrary to the intent of the parties hereto as expressed in this Section 3.03, any Taxing authority makes or proposes an allocation different from the Allocation determined under this Section 3.03, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in good faith to contest such Taxing authoritys allocation (or proposed allocation), provided, however, that, after consultation with the party (or parties) adversely affected by such allocation (or proposed allocation), the other party (or parties) hereto may file such protective claims or Tax Returns as may be reasonably required to protect its (or their) interests.

Entity in respect of such filings; (v) consult and cooperate with the other

is reasonably practicable, with any requests received by such Party or any of
its Affiliates under the HSR Act or any related Legal Requirements for
additional information, documents or other materials; (vii) use reasonable

Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and,
(viii) use reasonable efforts to contest and resist any action or proceeding
instituted (or threatened in writing to be instituted) by any Governmental
Entity challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
violative of the HSR Act or any other Legal Requirement. If a Party intends
to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity with respect to
such filings, it shall give the other Party reasonable prior notice of, and
an opportunity to participate in, such meeting. The Buyer shall pay in

 (b) Until the earlier of the Closing Date or termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall have reasonable access to the business, properties and employees of Seller and information concerning its financial and legal condition of the ownership and operation of the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities, provided that such access shall not interfere with normal operations of Seller. Seller agrees to permit Buyer and its authorized representatives, or cause them to be permitted, to have, after the date hereof and until the earlier of the Closing Date or termination of this Agreement, reasonable access to the Records during normal business hours, and the officers of Seller will furnish Buyer with such existing financial and operating data and other information in Sellers possession with respect to the Purchased Assets as Buyer shall from time to time reasonably request. In addition, Seller shall provide Buyer a copy of its audited financial statement for 2009 and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Buyer a copy of its audited financial statement for 2010 no later than February 22, 2011. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section shall obligate Seller to create or prepare any new data, documents or other information, except the foregoing audited financial statement for 2010. Buyer shall coordinate all of its requests for such access through Seller, and shall provide reasonable advance notice of such request. If, prior to or at the time of Closing, Buyer, its Affiliates, or its or their respective employees have knowledge of any breach of Sellers representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of same, including reasonable details of the circumstances giving rise to such breach; _provided, that_ , (i) Buyer shall not have any liability to Seller or its Affiliates for any failure of Buyer to so notify Seller, and (ii) no investigation by Buyer heretofore or hereafter made, or knowledge by Buyer, its Affiliates or its or their respective employees of any of breach of Sellers representations, warranties or covenants, shall affect the representations, warranties 

   ##### 

  

 

and covenants of Seller or Buyers right to indemnification as provided in
this Agreement, and each such representation, warranty and covenant shall
survive any such investigation. 

   

 (c) Seller shall, subject to Section 2.01(e), use its reasonable efforts to obtain the Required Consents, and Buyer shall provide Seller with any information and assistance reasonably requested by Seller in relation thereto. Except for those consents and approvals listed on  _Schedule 8.01(f)_ which are required to be obtained prior to Closing, to the extent any of the Required Consents are not obtained prior to Closing with respect to any Purchased Asset (a " _Non-Assigned Asset_ "), the Closing shall not be delayed due to failure to obtain any such Required Consent, such Non-Assigned Asset shall not be conveyed to Buyer at Closing, and upon the Closing such Non-Assigned Asset shall be deemed to be held by Seller at all times during the Holding Period for the benefit of Buyer in accordance with this Section. During the Holding Period, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, grant to Buyer an exclusive right and license to use each such Non-Assigned Asset and provide Buyer with the economic benefits and risks of ownership of the Non-Assigned Assets, and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Required Consent related to such Non-Assigned Assets, the intent of the Parties being to provide Buyer, to the extent the same can be reasonably done, with the same access and ability to utilize such Non-Assigned Assets as if such Non-Assigned Assets had been included within the Purchased Assets. Seller will promptly pay to Buyer when received all monies received by Seller under any Non-Assigned Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder to the extent attributable to the Holding Period (net of any amounts for which Seller is entitled to be reimbursed pursuant to this Section). Buyer shall pay, perform and discharge, fully and promptly when due, all the obligations of Seller under such Non-Assigned Asset from and after the Closing Date, and Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Damages that arise out of, result from or are payable as a result of Buyers or any of its Affiliates performance, breach or default under, operation of, or conditions existing, arising or occurring with respect to, any Non-Assigned Asset. For purposes of this Agreement, if the Non-Assigned Asset is an easement or similar right, then the term Non-Assigned Asset shall include the portion of the associated Improvements located thereon. Upon receipt of the Required Consent related to a Non-Assigned Asset, Seller shall assign such Non-Assigned Asset to Buyer using the same form of conveyance which would have been used had the Non-Assigned Asset been assigned at the Closing, and without the payment of any additional consideration. For purposes of this Agreement, the term _"Holding Period,"_ for any particular Non-Assigned Asset, shall mean the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the earlier of (i) the date upon which the Contract for which the Required Consent was not obtained expires or otherwise terminates or (ii) the date upon which such Required Consent or an alternative arrangement is obtained on terms that are substantially similar in operational and economic effects as the assignment of the Non-Assigned Asset to Buyer. 

  

 (d) From the date of this Agreement until Closing, Seller shall operate its business and maintain the Purchased Assets in the ordinary course and substantially in accordance with its past operating and maintenance practices, and Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, without the prior written consent of Buyer (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed): (i) other than in the ordinary course of business (which shall include Sellers field personnel bonus program), grant any bonus to or increase any salary or other compensation or benefits of any Eligible Employee; (ii) sell, assign, transfer, lease, relocate, terminate, release, 

   ##### 

  

 

close, abandon or otherwise dispose of any of the Purchased Assets, but Seller
may dispose of tangible personal property with a value less than $100,000 to
the extent replaced by equivalent property or used or consumed in the normal
operations of the Purchased Assets, and Seller may dispose of natural gas,
natural gas liquids and other products pursuant to the Contracts and
the Excluded NAESB Contracts; (iii) make any individual capital expenditure
or commitment related to the Purchased Assets in excess of $100,000 to the
extent Buyer will be liable or responsible for same, provided, however, this
limitation shall not apply (A) to expenditures for the AFE Projects under the
AFEs, except to the extent expenditures with respect to a line item amount set
forth in the AFEs will exceed such line item amount by more than $100,000, or
(B) to situations believed in good faith by Seller to constitute an emergency
(in which case Sellers obligation is limited to notifying Buyer as soon as
reasonably practicable of such emergency and obligations); (iv)
amend, assign, transfer, waive any rights under, terminate or otherwise
dispose of any of the Contracts or enter into any new contracts or agreements
related to the Purchased Assets, except for the Transition Services Agreement
and any new easements, rights-of-way, surface use agreements, surface lease
agreements, line rights or real property licenses acquired by Seller with
respect to the Purchased Assets or any extensions thereto during the period
from and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date consistent
with its past practices and requiring payment of less than $25,000 in each
individual instance to acquire (collectively, the " _New Easements_ ");
(v) terminate the employment with Seller or its Affiliates of any of the
Eligible Employees other than for cause; (vi) liquidate, dissolve,
recapitalize or otherwise wind up its business; (vii) merge or consolidate
with, or purchase substantially all of the assets or business of, or equity
interests in, or make an investment in any Person; or (viii) agree, whether
in writing or otherwise, to do any of the foregoing. In the event Seller
acquires New Easements prior to Closing, Seller shall, by written notice to
Buyer, add such New Easements to _Schedule 2.01(b)(i)(B)_, and such
New Easements shall be included as Easements and Purchased Assets hereunder.
For the avoidance of doubt, such addition of New Easements to _Schedule
2.01(b)(i)(B)_ shall not constitute grounds for termination of this Agreement
by Buyer under Section 8.03(d). 

   

 (e) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, Seller shall provide such reasonable cooperation, information and documentation as may be reasonably requested by Buyer and that is customary in connection with a financing comparable to the Debt Financing, including (i) furnishing to Buyer and its Lending Sources, as promptly as practicable all financial, business and other pertinent information related to Seller reasonably required by Buyer for Buyer to produce the financial statements and other offering document information, including all financial statements (including audited financial statements for fiscal years 2008, 2009 and 2010) and pro forma financial statements in the form required by Regulation S-X under the Securities Act and of the type and in the form customarily included in an offering memorandum under Rule 144A to consummate the Debt Financing (information required to be delivered pursuant to this clause (i), the " _Required Information_ "); (ii) to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer or its Lending Sources, requesting any consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt Financing and the delivery of one or more customary representation letters and executing and/or delivering all appropriate definitive documents to assist in consummation of the Debt Financing; and (iii) taking corporate actions by Seller reasonably necessary to permit the completion of the Debt Financing; _provided, however_ , that, except as otherwise provided in Section 4.04, none of Seller or its Affiliates, shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection 

   ##### 

  

 

with the Transaction Financing. Buyer shall promptly, upon request by Seller
following the Closing or termination of this Agreement, reimburse Seller for
all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including outside attorneys fees)
incurred by Seller or its Affiliates, in connection with the cooperation
contemplated by this Section 4.02. All non-public information regarding Seller
and its Affiliates provided to Buyer, its Affiliates or its representatives
pursuant to this Section 4.02 shall be kept confidential, except that Buyer
shall be permitted to disclose such information to potential lenders,
investors, rating agencies or their respective Representatives in
connection with the Debt Financing, subject to obtaining customary
confidentiality commitments. 

   

 (f) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Seller Indemnified Parties shall not have any responsibility for, or incur any Liability to any Person under, the Transaction Financing or any other financing that Buyer may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any cooperation provided pursuant to Section 4.02(e) (other than, in the case of Seller, liability to Buyer for breach of Sellers obligations under Section 4.02(e)) and Sellers obligations under Section 4.04, and that Buyer shall indemnify, defend, hold harmless and release the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Claims and Damages that arise out of, result from or are payable in connection with the Transaction Financing or such other financing, and any information utilized in connection therewith, IN EACH CASE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE SOLE, PARTIAL OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY (BUT NOT THE WILLFUL AND WANTON MISCONDUCT) OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES.

There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Transaction Financing, other than as set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment and the Unit Purchase Agreement(s).

Financing Commitment (including the fee letters and other agreements entered
into in connection therewith which have been provided to Seller in redacted
form) and the Unit Purchase Agreement(s) constitute the entire and complete
agreements between the parties thereto with respect to the Transaction
Financing.

against a Seller Indemnified Party for the indemnity obligations of Buyer to
apply. 

  

 (c) In the event that any Claim for which Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand (each an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), would be liable to the other Party or another Person indemnified under this Section 10.01 (each collectively, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") is asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party by a non-Affiliate third Person, the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Claim promptly after becoming aware of such Claim, specifying the nature of and specific basis for such Claim and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent then feasible (the " _Claim Notice_ "); provided, however, that no failure or delay in the giving of such Claim Notice shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such omission or delay. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from the delivery of the Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Party whether or not it desires, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to defend the Indemnified Party against such Claim; provided, however, that any Indemnified Party is hereby authorized during the Notice Period, after giving additional notice to the Indemnifying Party, to file any motion, answer or other pleading necessary to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and not prejudicial to the defense of such Claim. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall, at its own expense, assume the defense of any such Claim either directly or through its insurer. In such case, but subject to Section 10.01(d) below, the Indemnifying Party shall control the course of and make all decisions concerning any such proceeding, select and employ counsel (with the approval of the Indemnified Party, not to be unreasonably withheld), and settle or prosecute such proceeding to a final conclusion, and the Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any such defense or settlement at its own cost and with its own counsel, and if requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, or, if appropriate and related to the Claim in question, in making any counterclaim against the Person asserting the third-party Claim, or any cross-complaint against any Person. To the extent the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense of any Claim for which it has an indemnity obligation under this Section 10.01, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, and be reimbursed for its reasonable cost and 

   ##### 

  

 

expense incurred (but only if and to the extent the Indemnified Party is
actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in regard to such Claim with
counsel selected by the Indemnified Party (who shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party), by all appropriate proceedings. In
such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall defend such Claim in good
faith and have full control of such defense and proceedings; provided,
however, that the Indemnified Party may not enter into any compromise or
settlement of such Claim, if indemnification is to be sought hereunder,
without the Indemnifying Partys consent. Additionally, in such circumstances,
the Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section
10.01(c), and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and expenses
with respect to such participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending proceeding in respect
of which any Indemnified Party is a party, unless (A) such settlement
includes a full and unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding, (B) such
settlement does not contain any admission of wrongdoing or illegal conduct
and (C) the Indemnifying Party has agreed in writing that it is liable to pay
the full amount of the settlement to the extent pertaining to such
Indemnified Party. 

   

 (d) If a Party becomes an Indemnified Party, it shall, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and permit the Indemnifying Party reasonable access to the Indemnified Partys books, records, facilities and employees for the purpose of permitting the Indemnifying Party to perform its obligations under this Section 10.01; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall not be required to disclose to the Indemnifying Party any documents or correspondence covered by the attorney-client privilege or the work product doctrine, except pursuant to a joint defense agreement. To the extent that any documents or correspondence are covered by the attorney-client privilege or the work product doctrine, the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party if the Indemnified Party seeks to protect such privilege with respect to third parties. The Indemnified Party shall disclose to the Indemnifying Party the non-privileged contents of any such documents or correspondence. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall negotiate in good faith a joint defense agreement with respect to the matter that is the subject of the privileged communication or work product. 

  

 (e) With respect to the Indemnification Escrow Amount: 

   

 (i) Any payment required to be made by Seller to any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 10.01(a) shall be first paid by release of all or a portion, as applicable, of the Indemnification Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms of this Section and the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, for so long as any portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount and/or any income thereon remains on deposit in the escrow account. The Indemnification Escrow Amount shall only be released and distributed in accordance with joint written instructions provided by Buyer and Seller to the Escrow Agent (" _Joint Instructions_ ") or a final and non-appealable decision rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction (a " _Final Order_ "). At any time and from time to time prior to the Final Distribution Date, if any Buyer Indemnified Party claims in good faith that payment is due from Seller pursuant to Sellers indemnification obligations under Section 10.01(a), Buyer shall give written notice of such claim to Seller and the 

   ##### 

  

    

Escrow Agent (each an " _Escrow Claim_ ") setting forth (A) the nature of and
basis for the Escrow Claim, and (B) the amount to which such Buyer
Indemnified Party is entitled pursuant to Section 10.01(a) (the " _Escrow
Claim Amount_ ") (to the extent the Escrow Claim Amount is known and
quantifiable as of such date and, if unknown, a good faith estimate assuming
the facts are true). Seller shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the
Escrow Claim to dispute such Escrow Claim in writing delivered to Buyer and
the Escrow Agent within such 30-day period (a " _Dispute Notice_ "). If
Seller does not give a Dispute Notice, then the Escrow Claim Amount set forth
in the Escrow Claim Notice shall be deemed conclusive for purposes of this
Agreement, and the Parties shall, on the first (1st) Business Day after
expiration of such 30-day period, provide Joint Instructions to the Escrow
Agent for release and distribution of such Escrow Claim Amount to Buyer from
the Indemnification Escrow Amount. If Seller gives a Dispute Notice, the
Parties shall, on the first (1st) Business Day after expiration of such
30-day period, provide Joint Instructions to the Escrow Agent for release and
distribution of any undisputed portion of the Escrow Claim Amount to Buyer
from the Indemnification Escrow Amount, but payment with respect to
any disputed Escrow Claim Amount (or portion thereof) shall only be made from
the Indemnification Escrow Amount in accordance with Joint Instructions or a
Final Order to enforce an award with respect to such Escrow Claim Amount. 

   

 (ii) On the first (1st) Business Day after the date (the " _First Distribution Date_ ") that is three (3) months from the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall provide Joint Instructions to the Escrow Agent detailing the amount and delivering instructions for a release of a portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount to Seller in an aggregate amount equal to one-third (1/3rd) of the Indemnification Escrow Amount, minus (x) the amounts for any Escrow Claims already satisfied by a distribution from the Indemnification Escrow Amount, and (y) the amounts of any Unresolved Claims that are pending on the First Distribution Date. 

   

 (iii) On the first (1st) Business Day after the date (the " _Second Distribution Date"_ ) that is six (6) months from the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall provide Joint Instructions to the Escrow Agent detailing the amount and delivering instructions for a release of a portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount to Seller in an aggregate amount equal to two-thirds (2/3rd) of the Indemnification Escrow Amount, minus (x) the amounts for any Escrow Claims already satisfied by a distribution from the Indemnification Escrow Amount, (y) the amounts of any Unresolved Claims that are pending on the Second Distribution Date, and (z) all amounts previously distributed to Seller pursuant to Section 10.01(e)(ii) above. 

   

 (iv) On the first (1st) Business Day after the date (the " _Final Distribution Date_ ") that is twelve (12) months from the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall provide Joint Instructions to the Escrow Agent detailing the amount and delivering instructions for a release of the remaining portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount to Seller; provided, however, the Escrow Agent shall retain sufficient amounts for any Unresolved Claims that are pending on the Final Distribution Date. Any income that accrues on the Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be distributed to Seller as part of the final distribution from and termination of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, unless the 

   ##### 

  

    

entire amount of the Indemnification Escrow Amount has been released to Buyer
pursuant to this Section 10.01(e), in which event (x) a portion of such
income equal to that amount necessary to satisfy any then remaining
undisputed Escrow Claim Amounts or any award to Buyer under a Final Order
with respect to a disputed Escrow Claim Amount (which has not then been paid)
shall be released to Buyer and (y) the remaining portion of such income (if
any) shall be released to Seller. 

   

 (v) " _Unresolved Claim_ " shall mean, as of the First Distribution Date, the Second Distribution Date or the Final Distribution Date, as the case may be, the aggregate amount of all Escrow Claims that are the subject of a pending Dispute Notice or Escrow Claims which have been delivered but for which Sellers 30-day dispute period has not expired as of such date. 

  

 10.02 _Exclusive Remedy Post-Closing._ From and after Closing, Section 10.01 shall be the exclusive remedy of both Parties for monetary Damages for breach of this Agreement and each of the Parties hereby waives any other Claim, cause of action, or remedy for monetary Damages that it might assert against the other, whether under statutory or common law, or any other Legal Requirement; _provided that_ nothing in this Section 10.02 shall prevent either Party from (i) seeking specific performance, injunctive and/or similar equitable relief for claims of breach or failure to perform covenants performable under this Agreement at any time after the Closing or (ii) pursuing, and recovering in respect of, any claim based on actual fraud. 

  

 10.03 _Cooperation and Preservation of Books and Records._ The Parties recognize that the Parties and their respective Affiliates may need access, from time to time, after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and Tax records and information held by the other Parties; therefore, the Parties shall (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to properly retain and maintain such records until the thirtieth (30th) day following the last date on which the period to which such records relate is subject to audit by any Governmental Entity, and (b) subject to the right of each Party to refrain from disclosing or making available any proprietary information, any written or oral communications that are subject to the attorney-client privilege and any documents that are covered by the work product doctrine, allow the requesting Party and its respective agents and other representatives, at times and dates mutually acceptable to the Parties, to inspect, review, and make copies of such records as the requesting Party may deem necessary or appropriate from time to time for use in connection with the preparation of Tax Returns relating to the Purchased Assets or in connection any lawsuit, Claim or Tax audit relating to the Purchased Assets. Such inspection, review and copying of records shall be conducted during normal business hours and at the requesting Partys expense. 

  

 10.04 _Receipts and Expenses._ (a) All monies, proceeds, receipts, credits and income attributable to the Purchased Assets (including those received by Seller under the Excluded NAESB Contracts with respect to the Purchased Assets) (" _Receipts_ ") and attributable to the periods of time from and after the Effective Time shall be the sole property and entitlement of Buyer, and, to the extent received by Seller or any of its Affiliates, shall be promptly accounted for and transmitted to Buyer, _provided, however_ , any Receipts attributable to the period of time prior to the end of the month during which Closing occurs may be utilized by Seller to pay Expenses attributable to the period of time from the Effective Time through the end of the month in which Closing occurs; and (b) all Receipts attributable to the period of time prior to the 

   ##### 

  

 

Effective Time shall be the sole property and entitlement of Seller and, to
the extent received by Buyer, shall be promptly accounted for and transmitted
to Seller. (c) All invoices, direct costs, expenses, disbursements and
payables attributable to the Purchased Assets (including those incurred by
Seller under the Excluded NAESB Contracts, the Excluded MSAs and the
Management Agreement with respect to the Purchased Assets and those incurred
by Seller to acquire any New Easements, but excluding the AFE Estimated Cost,
the AFE Actual Cost, the Pipeline Inventory Estimated Cost and the Pipeline
Inventory Actual Cost and any Treating Cost Difference owed by Buyer under
Section 3.01) (" _Expenses_ "), for all periods from and after the Effective
Time shall be the sole obligation of Buyer, and, to the extent any statements
for same are received by Seller or any of its Affiliates, shall be promptly
transmitted to Buyer, and paid by Buyer, _provided, however_ , Seller may pay
all such Expenses attributable to the period of time from the Effective Time
through the end of the month in which Closing occurs as permitted in Section
10.04(a) above; and (d) all Expenses for all periods prior to the Effective
Time shall, subject to Section 10.01, be the sole obligation of Seller, and,
to the extent any statements for same are received by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, shall, subject to Section 10.01, be promptly transmitted to
Seller, and paid by Seller. All imbalances attributable to the Purchased
Assets as of the time immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
retained by Seller, and Seller shall be entitled to any benefit on account
thereof and shall be responsible for any obligations with respect thereto.
All imbalances attributable to the period of time from and after the
Effective Time until Closing shall be cashed out by Seller under its
applicable balancing agreements, and all amounts received by Seller under
such cash-outs will be considered "Receipts" for purposes of this Section
10.04, and all amounts paid by Seller under such cash-outs will be considered
to be "Expenses" for purposes of this Section 10.04. 

   

 10.05 _Ad Valorem and Property Taxes._ All ad valorem taxes, real property taxes, personal property taxes and similar obligations attributable to the Purchased Assets (" _Property Taxes_ ") relating to the tax period during which the Effective Time occurs shall be apportioned to the Seller for the period up to and including the Effective Time and to the Buyer for the period after the Effective Time on a ratable daily basis over the entire tax period based on the Property Taxes assessed for the immediately preceding tax period. At Closing, the amount of Sellers prorated share of such Property Taxes shall be deducted from the Purchase Price, as full compensation for Sellers obligations with respect to all Property Taxes relating to the tax period during which the Effective Time occurs. Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid, when due, to the taxing authorities all Property Taxes relating to the tax period during which the Effective Time occurs. 

  

 10.06 _Transfer Taxes._ Buyer and Seller shall each be responsible for one-half of all Transfer Taxes required to be paid in connection with the sale of the Purchased Assets pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 10.07 _Investigation of Books and Records._ Buyers closing of the transaction contemplated hereby will constitute Buyers acknowledgment that it has had, prior to the Closing Date, access to the Purchased Assets, the Records, and the officers and employees of Seller to its full and complete satisfaction.

Except for such 

   ##### 

  

 

express representations and warranties, Seller makes no representation or
warranty of any kind as to the Records, any information contained therein or
any other information provided to Buyer by or on behalf of Seller. Buyer
agrees that any conclusions drawn from the Records and such information are
and shall be the result of its own independent review and judgment. 

   

 10.08 _Removal of Decals, Logos and Signs; Emergency Contact Numbers._ As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event later than ninety (90) days thereafter, Buyer shall cease to use and shall remove or cause to be removed the names and marks used by Seller and its Affiliates and all variations and derivatives thereof and logos relating thereto from the Purchased Assets and shall not thereafter make any use whatsoever of such names, marks, and logos whether as identification for the Purchased Assets or in connection with documentation and correspondence relating thereto, except as may be necessary to complete the transfer of the Purchased Assets and any consents related thereto. 

  

 10.09 _Transition Services._ In order to facilitate the transition of Buyer as the owner of the Purchased Assets, the Parties shall enter into a Transition Services Agreement, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit I_ (the " _Transition Services Agreement_ "), for a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date on which the Transition Service Agreement is terminated in accordance with its provisions. Pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, Seller shall provide or cause to be provided to Buyer certain support services specified therein. 

  

 10.10 _Suspended Funds._ The Parties acknowledge that Seller has suspended payment of certain funds in accordance with a Contract (the " _Suspended Funds_ ") as further described in _Schedule 10.10_. Seller shall transfer the Suspended Funds to Buyer at Closing, and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, including, but not limited to, Section 2.01(d), Buyer shall thereafter be fully responsible and liable for payment of such Suspended Funds to the appropriate Persons owed such funds, and such responsibility and liability shall be deemed to be Assumed Liabilities. 

  

 10.11 _Bulk Transfer Laws._ Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller with the provisions of any so called bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets; provided however, that in accordance with Article 10 hereof, Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from any Damages which Buyer may incur due to failure to comply with such laws. 

  

 10.12 _Limitation of Liability._  

  

 (a) IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY HERETO BE LIABLE HEREUNDER FOR EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, SPECIAL INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR LOST PROFITS OF ANY KIND, ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM, INCIDENT TO, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF SOLE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR DEFECT IN PREMISES, EQUIPMENT OR MATERIAL, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER PRE-EXISTING THIS AGREEMENT. This Section shall in no way limit or qualify the Parties indemnification obligations under Section 10.01 with respect to Claims made against any Party by a non-Affiliate third Person. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) SELLER SHALL NOT HAVE ANY RIGHTS OR CLAIMS AGAINST ANY LENDING SOURCE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE TRANSACTION FINANCING, WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE.

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, BUYER IS ACQUIRING THE PURCHASED ASSETS IN "AS-IS, WHERE-IS" PHYSICAL CONDITION, WITH ALL FAULTS, BOTH PATENT AND LATENT, REGARDLESS OF HOW SUCH FAULTS WERE CAUSED OR CREATED (BY SELLERS NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE). 

  

 10.14 _Non-Competition._ To assure that Buyer will realize the benefits of the transactions contemplated hereunder, Seller hereby agrees not to: 

  

 (a) For a period of one (1) year after the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, alone or as a shareholder, partner, joint venturer, officer, director, member, manager, employee, consultant, agent, independent contractor or equity interest holder of, or lender to, any Person, entity or business, engage in any business or activities the same as or similar to the business of operating the Purchased Assets within Roberts County, Texas and each of Van Buren, Conway, Faulkner and White Counties, Arkansas. 

  

 (b) For a period of one (1) year after the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment any employees of Buyer; _provided that_ , the foregoing shall not prohibit Seller from offering to employ or employing any such employees of Buyer who respond to a general employment advertisement not directed at Buyer or Buyers employees.

traded on a national securities exchange or over-the-counter market shall not
be deemed, in and of itself, to breach the prohibitions of this Section
10.14.

With respect to any suit, action or proceeding to which any Lending Source is a party, each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (a) submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City, and any appellate court from any thereof, and agrees that all claims in respect of any such suit, action or proceeding may be heard and determined only in such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court, (b) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any New York State court or in any such Federal court, (c) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such suit, action or proceeding in any such court, and (d) agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

 11.15 _Schedules._ Seller may by written notice to Buyer revise or supplement the disclosure Schedules hereunder, or add new disclosure Schedules, at any time prior to the Closing Date to reflect any information, event or circumstance that either (a) existed on the date hereof and should have been included on one or more existing or new disclosure Schedules but was not, or (b) came into existence after the date hereof and would have been required to be disclosed on one or more existing or new disclosure Schedules if such information was in existence on the date of this Agreement. Subject to Section 8.03(d), any such supplement, amendment or addition will be effective to cure and correct, for all purposes (including, but not limited to, Sellers indemnification obligations set forth in Section 10.01), any breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant that would otherwise have existed by reason of Seller not having made such amendment, supplement or addition.
