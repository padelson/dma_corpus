of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the " _Company
Common Stock_ ") then outstanding will thereupon be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive Twenty-Seven Dollars Fifty-Five Cents ($27.55) in

unanimously (i) determined and declared that this Agreement and the

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, on the Closing Date,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation of the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Newco. The Company, as the surviving corporation of the Merger, is sometimes
referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_." Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date,
Newco, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated
under the DGCL by filing a certificate of merger in customary form and
substance (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary of State_ ") in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. The time of such filing and acceptance
by the Delaware Secretary of State, or such later time as may be agreed in
writing by Newco and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger,
is referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_."

1.2 _The Surviving Corporation of the Merger_.

 

(a) _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_.

 

(i) _Certificate of Incorporation_. Subject to the terms of _Section_ __ _
7.11_, at the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company
shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read identically to the
Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and such amended and restated Certificate of
Incorporation shall become the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL and such Certificate of Incorporation;
_provided, however_ , that at the Effective Time the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so that the name
of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Barracuda Networks, Inc."

 

(ii) _Bylaws_. Subject to the terms of _Section_ __ _ 7.11_, at the Effective
Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall become the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL,
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such
Bylaws.

 



-2- 

    

(b) _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

 

(i) _Directors_. At the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

 

(ii) _Officers_. At the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly appointed.

 

1.3 _General Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.4 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock of the Merging Corporations_.

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each
certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub
shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Capital Stock of the Company_.

 

(i) _Generally_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Newco, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders of
any of the following securities, other than as otherwise set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 1.4(b)_, each Share that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished and automatically
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon the
surrender of the Certificate representing such Share or the transfer of
such Uncertificated Share in the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_
(or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of
an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner provided in  _Section_ __
_ 2.3(d)_); _provided, however_ , that the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to
Company Common Stock having a record date on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, all Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically

 



-3- 

    

 be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder of Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration issuable in respect thereof pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 1.4(b)(i)_. The Merger Consideration issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have
been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a certificate representing
Shares is presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, then such
certificate shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.4(b)_.

 

(ii) _Owned Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Newco, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders of any of
the following securities, each Share that is owned by Newco, Merger Sub or the
Company, or by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Newco,
Merger Sub or the Company, in each case immediately prior to the Effective
Time (" _Owned Shares_ "), shall be cancelled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.

(iii) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Owned Shares) and held by a holder who has not
voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing
and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such Shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares being referred to collectively as
the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under Delaware
Law with respect to such Shares) shall not be converted into a right to
receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to payment of
the appraised value of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL; _provided, however_ , that if, after the Effective Time, such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Shares shall be treated as if they
had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.4(b)(i)_, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing
such Share or transfer of such Uncertificated Share, as the case may be. The
Company shall provide Newco prompt written notice of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of Shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawal of
any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the
Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Delaware Law that relates to
such demand, and Newco shall have the opportunity and right to participate in
and direct all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to such
demands. Except with the prior written consent of Newco, the Company shall
not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such
demands.

(c) _Stock Awards of the Company_.

 

(i) _Stock Options_.

 

(A) To the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding
vested Company Option (including any Company Option that vests in connection
with the Merger) shall, without any action on the part of Newco, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right
to receive, an amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction for
any required withholding Tax as contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(f)_ of
this Agreement) equal to the product of: (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of each such vested
Company Option, multiplied by (y) the number of Shares of Company Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise in full of such vested Company Option (the "
_Option Consideration_ "); _provided, however_ , that if the exercise price
per share of any such vested Company Option is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration, such vested Company Option shall be cancelled and
terminated without any cash payment or other consideration being made in
respect thereof. The Company agrees to take all action necessary to
effectuate this cancellation of Company Options upon the Effective Time and to
give effect to this _Section_ __ _ 1.4(c)(i)(A)_ (including the satisfaction
of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) under the Exchange Act). As soon as
practicable (and in no event more than thirty (30) calendar days) following
the Closing, Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each holder
of a Company Option the Option Consideration (if any), without interest and
less any applicable withholding taxes, required to be paid to the holder of
such Company Option. The cancellation of a Company Option as provided in the
first sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 1.4(c)(i)(A)_ shall be deemed the
termination, and satisfaction in full, of any and all rights the holder had or
may have had in respect of such Company Option.

 

(B) Each unvested Company Option outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (and that will not vest in connection with the Merger) shall
be cancelled and converted into the contingent right to receive at the
Effective Time, in consideration of the cancellation of such unvested Company
Option, an amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction for any
required withholding Tax as contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(f)_ of the
Merger Agreement), equal to the product of: (x) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of each such unvested
Company Option; and (y) the number of Shares of Company Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise in full of such unvested Company Option (the " _Contingent
Option Consideration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the exercise price
per share of any such unvested Company Option is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration, such unvested Company Option shall be canceled and
terminated without any cash payment being made in respect thereof; _provided_
,  _further_ , that such per share Contingent Option Consideration shall not
be paid at the Effective Time but shall instead be subject to the holder
remaining continuously employed with the Surviving Corporation and
satisfaction of the original vesting conditions applicable to the underlying
unvested Company Option. As soon as practicable (and in no event more than
thirty (30) calendar days) following satisfaction of the underlying vesting
conditions, Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the per share
Contingent Option Consideration, without interest and

 



-5- 

    

 less any applicable withholding taxes, required to be paid to the holder of
such Company Option. The cancellation of a vested Company Option as provided
in the first sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 1.4(c)(i)(B)_ shall be deemed
the termination, and satisfaction in full, of any and all rights the holder
had or may have had in respect of such Company Option.

 

(ii) _RSUs_.

(A) Each vested RSU outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including any RSU that becomes a vested RSU in connection with the Merger)
shall, without any action on the part of Newco, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, an
amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction for any required
withholding Tax as contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(f)_ of this Agreement)
equal to the product of: (x) the Merger Consideration and (y) the number of
Shares of Company Common Stock subject to such vested RSU (the " _RSU
Consideration_ "). As soon as practicable (and in no event more than thirty
(30) calendar days) following the Closing, Newco shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay to each holder of a vested RSU the RSU Consideration (if
any), without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, required to
be paid to the holder of such vested RSU. The cancellation of an unvested RSU
as provided in the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 1.4(c)(ii)(A)_ shall
be deemed the termination, and satisfaction in full, of any and all rights the
holder had or may have had in respect of such RSU. For the avoidance of
doubt, each vested RSU that has previously been settled in Shares prior to the
Effective Time shall be treated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.4(b)_
hereof and shall not be paid any additional RSU Consideration pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 1.4(c)(ii)(A)_ or _(B)_.

(B) Each unvested RSU outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (and that will not vest in connection with the Merger) shall be cancelled
and converted at the Effective Time into the contingent right to receive, in
consideration of the cancellation of such unvested RSU, an amount in cash
(without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax as
contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(f)_ of the Merger Agreement), equal to the
product of: (x) the Merger Consideration; and (y) the number of Shares
subject to such unvested RSU (the " _Contingent RSU Consideration_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that such per share Contingent RSU Consideration
shall not be paid at the Effective Time but shall instead be subject to the
holder remaining continuously employed with the Surviving Corporation and
satisfaction of the original vesting conditions applicable to the underlying
unvested RSU. As soon as practicable (and in no event more than thirty (30)
calendar days) following satisfaction of the underlying vesting conditions,
Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the per share Contingent
RSU Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding
taxes, required to be paid to the holder of such RSU. The cancellation of an
unvested RSU as provided in the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _
1.4(c)(ii)(B)_ shall be deemed the termination, and satisfaction in full, of
any and all rights the holder had or may have had in respect of such RSU.

(d) _Company ESPP_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
necessary and appropriate actions so that (i) all outstanding purchase rights
under the Company

 



-6- 

    

 ESPP shall automatically be exercised, in accordance with the terms of the
Company ESPP, upon the earlier of (x) immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (y) the last day of the Offering Period (as defined in the Company ESPP)
in progress as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Final Offering_ "), (ii)
the Company ESPP shall terminate with such purchase and no further purchase
rights are granted under the Company ESPP thereafter, (iii) each individual
participating in the Company ESPP shall not be permitted (x) to increase the
amount of his or her rate of payroll contributions thereunder from the rate in
effect on the date of this Agreement, or (y) to make separate non-payroll
contributions to the Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement;
and (iv) no individual who is not participating in the Company ESPP as of the
date of this Agreement may commence participation in the Company ESPP
following the date of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company
shall not be permitted to extend any Offering Period under the Company ESPP
that is outstanding as of the date of this Agreement. All Shares purchased in
the Final Offering shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. 

1.5 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes or intent of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub, the directors and officers of the Company and
Merger Sub shall have the authority to take all such lawful and necessary
action. The Company (including the Company Board and each relevant committee
thereof) will ensure that following the Effective Time no participant in any
Company Equity Incentive Plan or other similar Employee Plan will have any
right thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

 

1.6 _No Further Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions with respect
to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after
the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.

-10- 

    

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Newco shall select a bank or
trust company, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ ").

(b)  _Payment Fund_.

(i) _Creation of Payment Fund_. On the Closing Date, Newco or the Surviving
Corporation shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent,
for payment to the holders of Shares pursuant to the provisions of _Article
I_, an amount of cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
Merger Consideration by (y) the aggregate number of Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding Owned Shares
and Dissenting Shares) (such cash amount being referred to herein as the "
_Payment Fund_ "). From time to time following the Effective Time as
required, Newco or the Surviving Corporation shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Payment Agent additional cash in any amount necessary to
enable the Payment Agent to pay any and all Merger Consideration
payable hereunder.

(ii) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Shares on the date that is one
(1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand, and any holders of Shares that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore exchanged their Shares for the Merger Consideration pursuant to
the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 1.4(b)_ shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar
Applicable Laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any payment of and
claim to the applicable Merger Consideration to which such holders may be
entitled pursuant to the provisions of _Article I_. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of the Shares two (2) years after the Effective Time, or
at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority,
will, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any such
holders (and their successors, assigns or personal representatives) previously
entitled thereto.

 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Newco and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each
holder of record of Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i)
a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ")
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares
(excluding Owned Shares and Dissenting Shares) (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of non-certificated Shares (excluding Owned
Shares and Dissenting Shares) represented by book entry (" _Uncertificated
Shares_ ") to the Payment Agent); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
the provisions of _Article I_. Each holder of Shares that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares

 



-11- 

    

 represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share, upon (x) surrender to
the Payment Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly
executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be
requested by the Payment Agent, or (y) receipt of an "agents message" by the
Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment
Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may
be, from and after the Effective Time each such Certificate or Uncertificated
Share shall represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of
_Article I_. If Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth in _Article I_. No interest shall be
paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of
such Certificate or Uncertificated Share. From and after the Effective Time,
there will be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance
with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective
Time.

 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration issuable in respect thereof pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
1.4(b)(i)_; _provided, however_ , that the Surviving Corporation may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in
such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

(e) _Transferred Shares_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be
a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or
such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Payment Agent any transfer or other
similar Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to
the satisfaction of the Payment Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 

(f) _Tax Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Newco and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under Applicable Law. To the extent that such amounts are
so deducted or withheld and remitted to the applicable Governmental
Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

 



-12- 

    

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Newco, the Surviving Corporation
or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Shares for any amount
properly paid to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat
or similar Applicable Law.

and the rules of the SEC and NYSE. The Company may not file the Proxy

review and comment thereon, which comments shall be considered by the Company
in good faith. On the date of filing, the date of mailing to the stockholders
of the Company (if applicable) and at the time of the Company Stockholder
Meeting, neither the Proxy Statement nor any Other Required Company Filing
will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by
the Company with respect to any information supplied by Newco, Merger Sub or
any of their Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing. The information supplied
by the Company or its Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in any Other Required Newco Filings will not, at the time that such Other

Required Newco Filing with the SEC. Newco and Merger Sub shall cause, and

of filing, the date of mailing to the stockholders of the Company (if

Statement or such Other Required Company Filing is filed with the SEC,
knowingly contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading.

 

(iv) Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Newco and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, shall furnish all information concerning it and its Affiliates,
if applicable, as the other party may reasonably request in connection with
the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement and any Other
Required Company Filing or any Other Required Newco Filing. If at any time
prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting any information relating to the
Company, Newco, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates should be
discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Newco or Merger Sub, on the
other hand, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Newco
Filing, as the case may be, so that such filing would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then the party
that discovers such information will promptly notify the other, and
an appropriate amendment or supplement to such filing describing such
information will be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC by the
appropriate party and, to the extent required by applicable law or the SEC or
its staff, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the stockholders
of the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable following the filing
thereof with the SEC and confirmation from the SEC that it will not review, or
that it has completed its review of, the Proxy Statement (which 

 



-45- 

    

 confirmation will be deemed to occur if the SEC has not affirmatively
notified the Company prior to the end of the tenth (10th) calendar day after
filing the preliminary Proxy Statement that the SEC will or will not be
reviewing the Proxy Statement) (the " _SEC Clearance Date_ ").

(b) _Stockholder Meeting_.

or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting. Once established, the Company
shall not change the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting without
the prior written consent of Newco (such consent not to be unreasonably

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing will
prevent the Company from postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholder
Meeting if (A) there are holders of an insufficient Shares present or
represented by proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum
at the Company Stockholder Meeting or (B) the Company is required to postpone
or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by Applicable Law, order or a
request from the SEC or its staff, (C) if the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal

Company Stockholder Meeting in order to give the stockholders of the Company
sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company
has sent to the stockholders of the Company or otherwise made available to the
stockholders of the Company (including in connection with any Company Board
Recommendation Change) or (D) Newco consents to such postponement or
adjournment. 

(ii) The Company shall solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law, and
unless the Company Board has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change,

withhold, withdraw, amend, modify or qualify the Company Board Recommendation
in a manner that is adverse to Newco, (2) approve, endorse, adopt or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, adopt or recommend, an

than two occasions), (4) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in

" _Company Board Recommendation Change_ ").

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change at any time
prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval in the event that:

(A) the Company Board has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
after the date of this Agreement that was not solicited in violation of
_Section_ __ _ 6.1,_ _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ or in material violation of 
_Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_;

(B) The Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and its outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal (which determination and any public
announcement thereof shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation
Change);

 

(C) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company
Board shall have given Newco at least three (3) Business Days notice of its
intention to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(ii)_ (the " _Change of Recommendation Notice Period_ ")
(which notice shall include the most current version of the proposed
definitive agreement (which shall be marked to show changes to this Agreement)

such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Superior
Proposal);

shall not have made a counter-offer or proposal in writing and in a manner
that, if accepted by the Company, would form a binding contract, that the
Company Board determines (after consultation with its financial advisor and

Company as such Superior Proposal (it being understood that (x) any material
revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal, including, any revision in
price, shall require a new notice pursuant to clause (C) above, (y) the
Change of Recommendation Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to
the extent necessary to ensure that at least three (3) Business Days remain in

extensions of the Change of Recommendation Notice Period); and

 

(F) the Company Board determines (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and after considering any counter-offer or proposal made by Newco
pursuant to clause (E) above), that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the
failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
the Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in
response to an Intervening Event at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite
Stockholder Approval in the event that the Company Board determines (after

would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties;
_provided_ that, prior to effecting a Company Board Recommendation Change
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(iii)_, the Company Board shall have
given Newco at least three (3) Business Days notice of its intention to

such Company Board Recommendation Change) and, if requested by Newco, the
Company shall have met and negotiated in good faith with Newco regarding
modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the
Company Board no longer determines that the failure to make a Company Board
Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.

(iv) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking
and disclosing to stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
under the Exchange Act or any other Applicable Law; _provided, however_ ,
that any statement(s) made by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a)
under the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act shall be subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; _provided, further_ , for
avoidance of doubt, that it shall not constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change for the Company Board to make a "stop, look and listen"
communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act.

(a) _Filings and Cooperation_. As soon as reasonably practicable following
the execution and delivery of this Agreement (and in any case within 10
Business Days with respect to the HSR Act and 15 Business Days with respect to
filings of other Relevant Antitrust Jurisdictions), each of Newco and the
Company shall file with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a
Notification and Report Form relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) as required by the HSR Act, as well
as comparable pre-merger notification filings, forms and submissions that are
required in the Relevant Antitrust Jurisdictions. Each of Newco and the
Company shall (i) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making of
such filings, (ii) supply the other with any information that may be required
in order to effectuate such filings, and (iii) supply any additional
information that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ
or the competition or merger control authorities of any other jurisdiction
and that Newco reasonably deems necessary and/or appropriate. Each party
hereto shall promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case
may be, of any communication from any Governmental Authority in the U.S. or
any Relevant Antitrust Jurisdictions regarding the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any party hereto or Affiliate
thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary material
from any such Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party shall use
reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request.

(b) _Remedies_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_, if and to the extent necessary to obtain clearance of
the Merger pursuant to the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws applicable to
the Merger, each of Newco and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable) and the Company and its Subsidiaries will (i) offer, negotiate,
commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, any
restrictions on the activities of Newco and Merger Sub (and their respective
Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand; and (ii) contest, defend and appeal any Legal
Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement
or the consummation of the Merger; _provided_ that, neither Newco nor Merger
Sub (nor their respective Affiliates, if applicable) or the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall be required to sell, divest, license or otherwise dispose
of any capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets (whether
tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses of Newco or Merger Sub
(or their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and
the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand; _provided, further_ ,
that neither Newco nor Merger Sub (nor their respective Affiliates) shall be
required to take any action that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse impact on the
reasonably expected benefits to Newco or Merger Sub (or their respective
Affiliates) of completing the Merger.

 

7.3 _Financing_.

(a)  _No Amendments to Financing Commitment Letters_. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, each of Newco and Merger Sub will not
(without the prior written consent of the Company) permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any

 



-49- 

    

provision or remedy pursuant to, the Financing Commitment Letters if such
amendment, modification or waiver would, (i) reduce the aggregate amount of
the Debt Financing (unless the Equity Financing is increased by an equivalent
amount or the representations in _Section_ __ _ 4.9(c)_ (as though made at
the time of the effectuation of such amendment, modification, supplement or
replacement) shall remain true and correct after taking into account such
reduction) or reduce the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing, (ii) impose
new or additional conditions or other terms (except in connection with any
"market flex" terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter provided as of the
date hereof) to the Financing, or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Financing, in a manner that would reasonably
be expected to (A) delay, prevent or materially impede the consummation of the
Merger, or (B) make the timely funding of the Financing, or the satisfaction
of the conditions to obtaining the Financing, less likely to occur in any
respect, or (iii) adversely impact the ability of Newco, Merger Sub or the
Company (solely with respect to the Equity Commitment Letter), to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Financing Commitment Letters or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto. In addition to the foregoing,
Newco shall not release or consent to the termination of the Debt Commitment
Letters or of any individual lender under the Debt Commitment Letters, except
for (x) assignments and replacements of an individual lender under the terms
of, and only in connection with, the syndication of the Debt Financing under
the Debt Commitment Letters, or (y) replacements of the Debt Commitment
Letters with alternative financing commitments pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.3(c)_.

(b) _Equity Financing_. Newco shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions
and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain the Equity Financing, including by (i) maintaining in effect the Equity
Commitment Letter, (ii) complying with its obligations under the Equity
Commitment Letter, (iii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Newco or Merger Sub in such Equity Commitment Letter that are
within its control, if any, (iv) enforcing its rights under the
Equity Commitment Letter and (v) consummating the Equity Financing at or
prior to Closing, including by causing the Equity Financing Source to fund the
Equity Financing at the Closing, in each case in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter.

(c) _Debt Financing and Alternate Debt Financing_. Newco shall use (or cause
Merger Sub to use) its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
and obtain the financing contemplated thereby on the terms and conditions
(including, to the extent required, the full exercise of any flex provisions)
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, including using its reasonable best
efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance
with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, (ii) comply with its
obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) negotiate, execute and
deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions (including the flex
provisions) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, (iv) satisfy on a
timely basis (or obtain a waiver to) all conditions to funding that are
applicable to Newco and Merger Sub in the Debt Commitment Letter and the
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter, (v) enforce its rights pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter, and (vi) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the
Closing, including by causing the Debt Financing

 



-50- 

    

Sources to fund the Debt Financing at the Closing. Newco and Merger Sub will
fully pay, or cause to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees arising
pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter as and when they become due. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including the flex provisions) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
(unless such portion is not reasonably required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), Newco shall use its reasonable best
efforts to, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of
such event, (i) obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms
and conditions not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Newco and
Merger Sub than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and in an
amount at least equal to the Debt Financing or such unavailable portion
thereof, as the case may be (the " _Alternate Debt Financing_ "), and (ii)
obtain one or more new financing commitment letters with respect to such
Alternate Debt Financing (the " _New Debt Commitment Letters_ "), which New
Debt Commitment Letters will replace the existing Debt Commitment Letter in
whole or in part. Newco shall promptly provide the Company with a copy of any
New Debt Commitment Letters (and any fee letter in connection therewith). In
the event that any New Debt Commitment Letters are obtained, (A) any reference
in this Agreement to the "Financing Commitment Letters" or the "Debt
Commitment Letter" will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter to the
extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question
and any New Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect, and (B) any
reference in this Agreement to the "Financing" or the "Debt Financing" means
the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified
pursuant to the foregoing.

 

(d) _Information_. Newco shall (i) keep the Company fully informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing, and (ii) provide the Company with copies of all executed definitive
agreements related to the Financing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Newco and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company (A) of any
breach (or threatened breach) or default (or any event or circumstance that,
with notice or lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give
rise to any breach or default) by any party to the Financing Commitment
Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing, (B) of the receipt
by Newco or Merger Sub of any oral or written notice or communication from the
Equity Financing Source or any Debt Financing Source with respect to any (1)
breach (or threatened breach), default, termination or repudiation by any
party to a Financing Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements related to
the Financing of any provisions of the Financing Commitment Letter or such
definitive agreements, or (2) dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to a Financing Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements related
to the Financing, and (C) if for any reason Newco or Merger Sub at any time
believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the
Financing Commitment Letters or any definitive agreements related to the
Financing. Newco shall provide any information reasonably requested by
the Company relating to any of the circumstances referred to in the previous
sentence as soon as reasonably practical (but in any event within one Business
Day) after the date that the Company delivers a written request therefor to
Newco. Newco shall, and shall use its best efforts to cause the Equity
Financing Source and the Debt Financing Sources to, provide the Company and
its Representatives with such access to Newco, the Equity

 



-51- 

    

Financing Source and the Debt Financing Sources as the Company and its
Representatives may reasonably request for the purpose of allowing the
Company and its Representatives to understand the status of Newcos efforts to
arrange the Financing; _provided_ that Newco and its Representatives shall be
permitted to participate in any such discussions or communications.

(e) _No Financing Condition_. Newco and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree
that obtaining the Financing is not a condition to the Closing.

(f) _Company Support_.

 

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to use their respective
reasonable best efforts, to provide Newco with all cooperation reasonably
requested by Newco to assist it in causing the conditions in the Debt
Commitment Letter to be satisfied or as is otherwise reasonably requested by
Newco in connection with the Debt Financing, including:

(A) participating (and causing senior management and Representatives, with
appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company, to participate) in a
reasonable and limited number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies, and
otherwise cooperating with the marketing efforts for any of the Debt
Financing;

(B) assisting Newco and the Debt Financing Sources (y) with the timely
preparation of customary (i) rating agency presentations, bank information
memoranda, marketing materials and similar documents required in connection
with the Debt Financing; (ii) high-yield offering documents, prospectuses,
memoranda and similar documents required in connection with the Financing;
and (z) by providing financial information as reasonably requested by Newco
and Merger Sub to enable Newco and Merger Sub to prepare forecasts of
financial statements of the Surviving Corporation for one or more periods
following the Closing;

(C) assisting Newco in connection with the preparation and registration
of (but not executing, unless effective only at or following the Effective
Time) any pledge and security documents, supplemental indentures, currency or
interest hedging arrangements and other definitive financing documents as may
be reasonably requested by Newco or the Debt Financing Sources (including
using reasonable best efforts to obtain consents of accountants for use of
their reports in any materials relating to the Debt Financing and accountants
comfort letters, in each case as reasonably requested by Newco), and
otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral and the granting
of security interests in respect of the Debt Financing, it being understood
that such documents will not take effect until the Effective Time;

(D) furnishing Newco and the Debt Financing Sources, as promptly as
practicable, with (a) audited financial statements of the Company for the
three most recently completed fiscal years ended at least ninety (90) days
before the Closing Date, (b) unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related
unaudited statements of income and cash flows related to the

 



-52- 

    

Company and its Subsidiaries, for each subsequent fiscal quarter (other than
the fourth fiscal quarter) ended at least forty-five (45) days before the
Closing Date, (c) the financial information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries necessary for Newco to prepare any pro forma financial statements
for historical periods required by paragraph 6 of Exhibit D of the Debt
Commitment Letter, and (d) such other financial and other pertinent
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries (including information
regarding the business, operations and financial projections thereof) as may
be reasonably requested by Newco to assist in the preparation of a customary
confidential information memorandum or other customary information documents
used in financings of the type contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
(all such information and documents in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)(i)(D)_,
the " _Required Financial Information_ "). If the Company in good faith
reasonably believes that it has provided the Required Financial
Information, it may deliver to Newco a written notice stating when it
believes that it completed such delivery, in which case the Company will be
deemed to have complied with this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)(i)(D)_ and the
Marketing Period shall be deemed to have commenced as of such date unless
Newco or the Debt Financing Source in good faith reasonably believe that the
Company has not completed delivery of the Required Financial Information and,
within three (3) Business Days after the delivery of such notice by the
Company, deliver a written notice to the Company to that effect, stating in
good faith the specific items of Required Financial Information the Company
has not delivered, in which case such Required Financial Information shall be
deemed to have been delivered and the Marketing Period to have commenced when
such specific items have been delivered by the Company. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, such Required Financial Information will
be deemed to not have been delivered if, at any point prior to the completion
of the Debt Financing, (a) such Required Financial Information contains any
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
necessary in order to make such Required Financial Information, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (b) such
Required Financial Information is not compliant in all material respects with
all requirements of Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X under the Securities Act
(excluding information required by Regulation S-X Rule 3-10 and Regulation
S-X Rule 3-16) for offerings of debt securities on a registration statement on
Form S-1 or sufficient to permit such a registration statement on Form S-1
from being declared effective by the SEC; (c) the Companys auditors have
withdrawn any audit opinion with respect to any financial statements
contained in the Required Financial Information; (d) with respect to any
interim financial statements (including any corresponding predecessor

Companys auditors as provided in the procedures specified by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board in AU 722; and (e) the Companys auditors
have not delivered drafts of customary comfort letters, including as to
customary negative assurances and change period, or such auditors indicated
that they are not prepared to issue such comfort letter; _provided_ that after
commencement of the Marketing Period, the delivery of additional financial
statements or pro forma financial information required to be delivered
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)(i)(D)_ due to the passage of time
shall not terminate or restart the Marketing Period;

 

(E) cooperating with Newco to obtain customary and reasonable corporate and
facilities ratings, consents, landlord waivers and estoppels, non-disturbance

Debt Commitment Letters;

(F) reasonably facilitating the pledging or the reaffirmation of the pledge
of collateral (including obtaining and delivering any pay-off letters and
other cooperation in connection with the repayment or other retirement
of existing indebtedness and the release and termination of any and all
related liens) on or prior to the Closing Date as may be reasonably necessary
to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing;

 

(G) delivering notices of prepayment within the time periods required by the
relevant agreements governing indebtedness and obtaining customary payoff
letters, lien terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered at the
Closing, and giving any other necessary notices, to allow for the payoff,
discharge and termination in full at the Closing of all indebtedness
required by the Debt Commitment Letters to be paid, discharged or terminated;

(H) cooperating with any marketing efforts of Newco and the Debt Financing
Sources for any portion of the Debt Financing (including providing executed
authorization letters to the Debt Financing Sources authorizing the
distribution of information to prospective lenders or investors and containing
a representation to the Debt Financing Sources that the public side versions
of such documents, if any, do not include material non-public information
about the Company or its Subsidiaries or securities and executing
ratings agency engagement letters as required in connection with the Debt
Financing ( _provided_ , that the Company shall not be required to pay any
cost or expenses relating to rating agency engagement letters));

 

(I) taking all corporate and other actions, subject to the occurrence of the
Closing, reasonably requested by Newco to (1) permit the consummation of the
Debt Financing (including, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law,
distributing the proceeds of the Debt Financing, if any, obtained by any
Subsidiary of the Company to the Surviving Corporation), and (2) cause the
direct borrowing or incurrence of all of the proceeds of the Debt Financing,
including any high-yield debt financing, by the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries concurrently with or immediately following the Effective
Time; and

 

(J) furnishing Newco and the Debt Financing Sources with all documentation and
other information required by regulatory authorities pursuant to applicable
"know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations,
_provided_ that the request for such information has been made at least ten
Business Days prior to Closing.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)(i)_ or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement will require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (A) waive or amend any terms of this
Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the
Effective Time for which it has not received prior reimbursement or is not
otherwise indemnified by or on behalf of Newco, (B) enter into any definitive
agreement (other than with respect to authorization letters and ratings agency
engagement letters referred to in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)(i)(H)_ that is
effective prior to the Closing), (C) give any

 



-54- 

    

indemnities in connection with the Financing that are effective prior to the
Effective Time, (D) take any action that, in the good faith determination of
the Company, would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business or
the Company and its Subsidiaries or create an unreasonable risk of damage or
destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (E) provide any information the disclosure of which is
prohibited or restricted under Applicable Law or is legally privileged, or (F)
take any action that will conflict with or violate its organizational
documents or any Applicable Laws or would result in a violation or breach of,
or default under, any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party. In addition, (1) no action, liability or obligation
of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document
or instrument relating to the Debt Financing will be effective until the
Effective Time, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be
required to take any action pursuant to any certificate, agreement,
arrangement, document or instrument (including being an issuer or other
obligor with respect to the Debt Financing) that is not contingent on the
occurrence of the Closing or that must be effective prior to the Effective
Time, and (2) any bank information memoranda and high-yield offering
prospectuses or memoranda required in relation to the Debt Financing will
contain disclosure and financial statements reflecting the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries as the obligor. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _
7.3_ will require (A) any officer or Representative of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate or opinion or take any other
action pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)(i)_ or any other provision of this
Agreement that could reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to
such officer or Representative, or (B) the members of the Company Board as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time to approve any financing or Contracts
related thereto.

 

(g) _Use of Logos_. The Company hereby consents to the use of all logos of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the Financing so long as such
logos (i) are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or likely to
harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) are used solely
in connection with a description of the Company, its business and products or
the Merger.

(h)  _Confidentiality_. All non-public or other confidential information
provided by the Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to this
Agreement will be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, except that Newco and Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose such
information to any financing sources or prospective financing sources and
other financial institutions and investors that are or may become parties to
the Debt Financing and to any underwriters, initial purchasers or placement
agents in connection with the Debt Financing (and, in each case, to their
respective counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons (i) agree to be bound
by the Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto, or (ii) are subject
to other confidentiality undertakings reasonably satisfactory to the Company
and of which the Company is a beneficiary.

 

(i) _Company Reimbursement and Indemnification_.

 

(i) If the Closing fails to occur for any reason, upon request by the Company,
Newco shall promptly (and in any event within thirty (30) calendar days of
invoice)

 



-55- 

    

 reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by the Company and/or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with providing the support and
cooperation contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)_.

 

(ii) Newco shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries,
and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and other
representatives, from and against any and all losses, damages, claims,
interest, costs or expenses (including legal fees and expenses), awards,
judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement suffered or incurred by
any of them in connection with providing the support and cooperation
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)_ and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than information provided by the Company or any of
the Companys Subsidiaries).

(j) _No Exclusive Arrangements_. In no event will the Guarantor, the Equity
Financing Source, Newco, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates
(which for this purpose will be deemed to include each direct investor in
Newco or Merger Sub and the financing sources or potential financing sources
of Newco, Merger Sub and such investors) enter into or enforce any Contract
prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank, investment bank or other
potential provider of debt or equity financing for the Merger or any other
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from providing or
seeking to provide debt or equity financing to any Person in connection with
the Merger or any other transaction relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

7.4 _Efforts to Close_.

 

(a) _Reasonable Best Efforts_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
other covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, including
_Sections 7.2_ and _7.3_ , each of Newco, Merger Sub and the Company shall use
their reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and
to do (or cause to be done), and to assist and cooperate with the other party
or parties hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the conditions to the Merger set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ to be satisfied or fulfilled, (ii) obtain all
necessary consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental
Authorities, the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods
under the HSR Act and all other applicable Antitrust Laws in the Relevant
Antitrust Jurisdictions, (iii) obtain all other necessary consents, waivers,
approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Authorities and make
all registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Authorities, in
each case that are necessary or advisable to consummate the Merger, and (iii)
obtain all necessary or appropriate consents, waivers and approvals under any
Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to maintain and preserve
the benefits under such Contracts following the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger).

 



-56- 

    

(b) _Forbearance_. In addition to the foregoing, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, (i) Newco or Merger Sub shall not (and shall
cause their Affiliates, including the Equity Financing Source, to not), and
(ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, in each case take any action,
or fail to take any action, that is intended to or has (or would reasonably
be expected to have) the effect of preventing, impairing, materially delaying
or otherwise adversely affecting (i) the consummation of the Merger, including
(A) imposing any delay in the obtaining of, or materially increasing the risk
of not obtaining, any authorization, consent, order, declaration or approval
of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the Merger or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (B) increasing
the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger, (C) increasing the risk of not being able to
remove any such order on appeal or otherwise, or (D) delaying or preventing
the consummation of the Merger or (ii) the ability of such party to fully
perform its obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing herein shall restrict Affiliates of Newco or Merger Sub
from acquiring any capital stock or other equity or voting interests, assets
(whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses of any
Person. For the avoidance of doubt, no action by the Company taken in
compliance with  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)_ will be considered a violation of
this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_.

(c) _No Consent Fee_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to agree to the payment of a
consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other consideration (including
increased or accelerated payments), or the provision of additional security
(including a guaranty), in connection with the Merger, including in connection
with obtaining any consent pursuant to any Material Contract.

7.5 _Access to the Company_. At all times during the period commencing with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier
to occur of the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _
VIII_ and the Effective Time, the Company shall afford Newco and its
Representatives (i) reasonable access, during normal business hours and after
reasonable advance notice, to all assets, properties, books and records and
personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Newco may reasonably request;
_provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may
restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the
extent that (a) any Applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information; (b) access to
such documents would be in violation of the HSR Act, Sherman Act, or any
applicable non-U.S. antitrust or competition laws; (c) access to such
documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege applicable
to such documents or information; (d) access to a Contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would
violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right
terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, such Contract; (e) access
would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third Persons; or (f)
such documents or information are reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal
Proceeding between the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Newco
and its Affiliates, on the other hand, and (ii) to the extent available and
prepared in the ordinary course of business, for the period beginning after
the date of this Agreement and ending at the Effective Time, as soon as

 



-57- 

    

 practicable after the end of each calendar month, and in any event within
thirty (30) days thereafter, a copy of the monthly consolidated financial
statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including statements of
financial condition, results of operations and statements of cash flow.
Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ will be construed to require the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to prepare
any reports, statements, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information
not otherwise prepared in the ordinary course of business. Any investigation
conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 7.5_
will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk
of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries
will be subject to the Companys reasonable security measures and insurance
requirements and will not include the right to perform invasive testing. The
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement will apply to any
information obtained by Newco or any of its Representatives in connection with
any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.5_. All requests for access pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.5_ must be directed to the General Counsel of the Company, or another person
designated in writing by the Company.

 

7.6 _Notice of Breach_.

 

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the

rule or listing agreement, (ii) principally directed to employees, suppliers,
customers, partners or vendors and consistent with the communications plan

(a) _Existing Agreements and Protections_. During the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Newco shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in
all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and
all indemnification agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any of their respective current or former directors and officers and
any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Persons_ "). In
addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and
other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as
the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set
forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar
organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof, and during such six-year period such provisions shall not be
repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by
Applicable Law.

 

(b) _Indemnification_. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 7.11(a)_, during the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any
costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, to the extent such claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or pertains directly
or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in
such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of
whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred
prior to, at or after the Effective Time), or (ii) any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that if, at any time
prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified
Person delivers to Newco a written notice asserting a claim for
indemnification under this _Section_ __ _ 7.11(b)_, then the claim asserted
in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time
until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of
any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (i) the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the
Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the defense
thereof, the Surviving

 



-60- 

    

 Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the
Indemnified Persons entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect
thereto), (ii) each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain his or her
own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control
the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (iii) the
Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of any
counsel retained by an Indemnified Person promptly after statements therefor
are received, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control
the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, and (iv)
no Indemnified Person shall be liable for any settlement effected without his
or her prior express written consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.11(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement,
neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of its Affiliates (including Newco)
shall settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought by an
Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified
Persons from all liability arising out of such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry.

(c) _Insurance_. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person covered by the DandO
Insurance, on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts that are
equivalent to those of the DandO Insurance; _provided, however_ , that in
satisfying its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 7.11(c)_, the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three
hundred percent (300%) of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its
last full fiscal year (such three hundred percent (300%) amount, the "
_Maximum Annual Premium_ ") (which premiums the Company represents and
warrants to be as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.11(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter); _provided, further_ , that that if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the DandO Insurance.
In the event that the Company elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior to
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Newco shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and
effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu
of all other obligations of the Surviving Corporation (and Newco) under the
first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 7.11(c)_ for so long as such "tail"
policy shall be maintained in full force and effect.

 

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If the Surviving Corporation (or Newco) or any
of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall

 



-61- 

    

 assume all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation (or Newco) set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.11_.

 

(e) _No Impairment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. The obligations set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.11_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise
modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any
other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy
referred to in  _Section_ __ _ 7.11(c)_ (and their heirs and
representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 7.11(c)_ (and
their heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons or other
persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy
referred to in  _Section_ __ _ 7.11(c)_ (and their heirs and
representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.11_, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto.
The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are
beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 7.11(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) under this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.11_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights that such persons may have under the certificates of
incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and
all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or Applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

 

(f) _Joint and Several Obligations_. The obligations and liability of the
Surviving Corporation, Newco and their respective Subsidiaries under this
_Section_ __ _ 7.11_ shall be joint and several.

(g) _Preservation of Other Rights_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to,
shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been
in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any
of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section_
__ _ 7.11_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such
policies.

7.12 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Acknowledgment of Change of Control_. Newco hereby acknowledges that a
"change of control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Employee
Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time, as applicable.

(b) _Existing Agreements_. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor
all Employee Plans and compensation arrangements in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding equity

prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any such
Employee Plans, arrangements or agreements in accordance with their terms or
if otherwise required by this Agreement or Applicable Law.

 



-62- 

    

(c) _Continuation of Company Plans_. As of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) employ the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are employed
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. For a period of one (1) year
following the Effective Time (or, if earlier, the date of termination of
employment of the relevant Continuing Employee), the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) either (i) maintain
for the benefit of each Continuing Employee the Employee Plans (other than
equity based benefits and individual employment agreements not providing for
severance) and any other employee benefit plans or other compensation and
severance arrangements of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than equity-based plans and individual employment
agreements not providing for severance) (together, the " _Company Plans_ ") at
benefit levels that are no less than those in effect at the Company or
its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, and provide compensation and
benefits to each Continuing Employee under such Company Plans, or (ii) provide
compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than equity based
benefits and individual employment agreements not providing for severance) to
each Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the
aggregate than the compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than
equity based benefits and individual employment agreements not providing for
severance) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time (" _Comparable Plans_ "), or (iii) provide some combination of
(i) and (ii) above such that each Continuing Employee receives compensation,
benefits and severance payments (other than equity based benefits and
individual employment agreements not providing for severance) that, taken as a
whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation, benefits
and severance payments (other than equity based benefits and individual
employment agreements not providing for severance) provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) _Service Credit; Etc_. To the extent that a Company Plan or Comparable
Plan is made available to any Continuing Employee on or following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Newco shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee
credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and
entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for
purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement); _provided,
however_ , that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would
result in duplication of coverage or benefits or was not credited for the same
purpose with respect to such Continuing Employee under the analogous Employee
Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee shall
be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and
all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans) (such plans, collectively, the "
_New Plans_ ") to the extent coverage under any such New Plan replaces
coverage under a comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Continuing
Employee, the Surviving Corporation shall cause all waiting periods, pre-
existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements
and actively-at-work or similar

 



-63- 

    

 requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents to the extent waived for such person under the
analogous Employee Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date, and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given
full credit under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan, and
(iii) credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees under any New Plan
which is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of
such Continuing Employee under the applicable Company Plan. Any vacation or
paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be credited to such Continuing Employee
following the Effective Time, and shall not be subject to accrual limits
other forfeiture that were not applicable as of the Effective Time.

(e) _No Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, this _Section_ __ _ 7.12_ will not be
deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the
ability of Newco, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii) subject
to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 7.12_, require Newco, the Surviving Corporation or any of their

third party beneficiary rights in any Person; or (iv) establish, amend or
modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement.

cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective

transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement. Newco and Merger Sub will be jointly
and severally liable for the failure by either of them to perform and
discharge any of their respective covenants, agreements and obligations
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement.

7.14 _Newco Vote_. Immediately following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Newco, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will

least ten (10) Business Days prior to Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries will use their commercially reasonable efforts (in the manner
reasonably requested in writing by Newco) to distribute or transfer or cause
to be distributed or transferred to the Company immediately before the
Closing (including pursuant to the repayment of outstanding intercompany
obligations) any cash balances held by any non-U.S. Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no distribution or transfer will be required to be made (i)
to the extent that such distribution or transfer would be subject to
withholding or other Taxes in

 



-64- 

    

 advance of the Effective Time, and (ii) unless and until all of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ have been satisfied
or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied or waived (if permitted hereunder) at the Closing, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such
conditions at the Closing), the Marketing Period has been concluded or
waived, and Newco has irrevocably confirmed that it is prepared to consummate

Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amounts due pursuant to

pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)_ and, in order to obtain such payment,
Newco, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a Legal

annual rate of five percent (5%) plus the prime rate as published in _The Wall

with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Financing)

an account or accounts designated in writing by Newco; _provided_ , that the
existence of circumstances which could require the Company Termination Fee to
become subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.4(a)(i)_ shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to pay the Newco
Expenses pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.4(d)_; _provided_ , _further_
, that the payment by the Company of Newco Expenses pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.4(d)_ shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent

(e) _Acknowledgement_. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that (i)
the agreements contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting
from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a
Company Termination Fee or a Newco Termination Fee is payable are uncertain
and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the amounts payable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)_ are not
a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount
that will compensate Newco or the Company, as the case may be, for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) without the
agreements contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.4_, the parties would not have
entered into this Agreement.

the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER NEWCO AND MERGER SUB, ON
THE ONE HAND, NOR THE COMPANY, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES TO THE OTHER, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR

(b) _Remedies of Newco and Merger Sub._ __

 

(i) _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable
injury would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the specific terms hereof or were otherwise
breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an
adequate remedy for any such damages (notwithstanding the termination
fees contemplated hereby). Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and
hereby agree that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, in the event of any breach of threatened breach by
the Company of any of its obligations hereunder, Newco and Merger Sub shall
be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company in the courts described
in  _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, including the Companys obligation to consummate the
Merger. The election to pursue an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit Newco from, in
the alternative, seeking to terminate the Agreement and collect the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_ and/or the reimbursement
of Newco Expenses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.4(d)_; _provided, however,_
that in no event shall Newco be permitted to pursue an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief or any other remedies under this
Agreement or available at law or equity following the payment of the Company
Termination Fee, when payable under the terms of this Agreement.

(ii)  _Company Termination Fee_. Newco shall be entitled to payment of the
Company Termination Fee if and when payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.4(a)_.

-74- 

    

(v) _Monetary Damages_. In no event shall (A) Newco, Merger Sub, the
Guarantor, or the Equity Financing Source or (B) the former, current and
future holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates (other than Newco, Merger Sub or the
Guarantor), members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and
assignees of each of Newco, Merger Sub, the Guarantor, the Equity Financing
Source and their respective Affiliates (the foregoing in clauses (A) and (B)
collectively, the " _Newco Related Parties_ ") have the right to seek or
obtain money damages from the Company or any Company Related Party under this
Agreement (whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise)
other than the right of Newco and Merger Sub to payment of the Company
Termination Fee as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_ and/or Newco Expenses
as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.4(d)_.

 

(c) _Remedies of the Company_.

 

(i) _Specific Performance (Pre-Closing Covenants)_. The parties hereto hereby
agree that irreparable injury would occur in the event that any provision of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the specific terms hereof
or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies
would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages (notwithstanding the
termination fees contemplated hereby). Accordingly, the parties hereto
acknowledge and hereby agree that, prior to the valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, in the event of any breach of
threatened breach by Newco or Merger Sub of any of their respective
obligations hereunder, and other than as it relates to the right to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger (which are
governed by the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 9.11(c)(ii)_), the Company shall
be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Newco and Merger Sub in the courts
described in _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof.

 

(ii) _Specific Performance (Closing)_. The parties hereto hereby agree that
irreparable injury would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with the specific terms hereof or
were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would
not be an adequate remedy for any such damages (notwithstanding
the termination fees contemplated hereby). Accordingly, the parties hereto
acknowledge and hereby agree that, prior to a valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, the Company shall be entitled to
an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy in connection
with enforcing Newcos obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded
(and to exercise its third party beneficiary rights under the Equity
Commitment Letter) and to consummate the Merger only in the event that each
of the following conditions has been satisfied: (A) the conditions set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_ have been satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing) at the
time the Closing would have occurred but for the failure of the Equity
Financing to be funded, (B) the Debt Financing has been funded in accordance
with the terms thereof or the Debt Financing Sources have confirmed in writing
that it will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if
the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, (C) Newco and Merger Sub shall
have failed to consummate the Merger by the time the Closing was required by
_Section_ __ _ 2.1_ to occur and

 



-75- 

    

(D) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Newco that if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are
funded, then it will take such actions that are required of it by this
Agreement to cause the Closing to occur. In no event shall the Company be
entitled to enforce specifically Newcos obligation to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded (or exercise its third party beneficiary rights under
the Equity Commitment Letter) if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or
will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at
the Closing). In no event shall the Company be entitled to specifically
enforce the terms of this Agreement other than solely under the specific
circumstances and as specifically set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.11(c)(i) _and
this  _Section_ __ _ 9.11(c)(ii)_. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event
shall the Company be entitled to a remedy of specific performance or other
equitable remedies against any Debt Financing Source. The election to pursue
an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief shall not
restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Company from, in the alternative,
seeking to terminate the Agreement and collect the Newco Termination Fee
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)_; _provided_ that in no event shall the
Company be permitted to pursue an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief or any other remedy under this Agreement or available at law
or equity following the payment of the Newco Termination Fee, when payable
under the terms of this Agreement.

(iii) _Newco Termination Fee_. The Company shall be entitled to payment of
the Newco Termination Fee if and when payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.4(b)_.

 

(iv) _Termination_. The Company shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.1_. 

(v) _Monetary Damages_ _._ In no event shall (A) the Company, its Subsidiaries
and each of their respective Affiliates or (B) the former, current and future
holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners,
stockholders and assignees of each of the Company, its Subsidiaries and each
of their respective Affiliates (foregoing in clauses (A) and (B) collectively,
the " _Company Related Parties_ ") have the right to seek or obtain money
damages or expense reimbursement (whether at law or in equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise) from Newco, Merger Sub, the Guarantor, the Equity
Financing Source or any other Newco Related Party other than the right of the
Company to payment of the Newco Termination Fee as set forth in  _Section_ __
_ 8.4(b)_ and to enforce its rights under the Guaranty. For the avoidance of
doubt, in the event this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 8.1_, the Newco Termination Fee (if payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.4(b)_) represents the maximum aggregate Liability of Newco, Merger Sub, the
Guarantor and any other Newco Related Party under this Agreement and the
transactions and other agreements contemplated hereby. In addition, and
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company hereby
(A) agrees that no Company Related Party shall have the right to seek or
obtain money damages or expense reimbursement (whether at law or in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise) from any Debt Financing Source and (B)
waives any and all claims against the Debt Financing Sources (and agrees not
to bring any claim or cause of action) and hereby agrees that in no event
shall the Debt Financing Sources have any liability or obligation to the
Company or any Company Related Party relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt

 



-76- 

    

Commitment Letters or the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 9.11(c)(v)_
shall in any way limit or modify the rights and obligations of Newco, Merger
Sub or the Financing Sources set forth under the Debt Commitment Letters. In
addition to the rights of Newco and Merger Sub hereunder, Newco and Merger
Sub shall be entitled, at Newco and Merger Subs sole election, to settle any
claims arising from or relating to this Agreement by agreeing to consummate
the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(d) _Acknowledgement Regarding Available Remedies_. Solely to the extent that
the right of specific performance is explicitly available under the terms of
this _Section_ __ _ 9.11_, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform their
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Solely to the extent that
the right of specific performance is explicitly available under the terms of
this _Section_ __ _ 9.11_, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts
described in _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ without proof of damages or otherwise, and
that such explicit rights of specific enforcement are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without such rights, none of
the Company, Newco or Merger Sub would have entered into this Agreement. Each
party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief expressly applicable under this
_Section_ __ _ 9.11_ on the basis that (i) it has an adequate remedy at law
or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each
