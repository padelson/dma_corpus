INTERCOMPANY INDEMNITY, SUBROGATION AND

 

CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT

 

INTERCOMPANY INDEMNITY, SUBROGATION and CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT (the "
_Agreement_ ") dated as of December 2, 2014, among TESORO LOGISTICS LP, a
Delaware limited partnership (the " _Company_ "), QEP MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP,
a Delaware limited partnership ("QEPM") and a Subsidiary of the Company, and
each Subsidiary of QEPM listed on Schedule I hereto or becoming a party
hereto as provided in _Section 12_ hereto (and together with QEPM, the "
_QEPM Subsidiary Guarantors_ ").

 

Reference is made to:

(a) that certain Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of
December 2, 2014 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to
time, the " _Credit Agreement_ "; capitalized terms used herein and not
defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit
Agreement), among the Company, the lenders from time to time party thereto
(the " _Lenders_ "), and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and
L/C Issuer (in its capacity as administrative agent, the " _Administrative
Agent_ "),

(b) that certain Indenture dated as of September 14, 2012 (as amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the " _2012 Indenture_
"), issued by the Company and Tesoro Logistics Finance Corp. (collectively,
the " _Issuers_ ") to U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "
_Trustee_ "),

(c) that certain Indenture dated as of August 1, 2013 (as
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the " _2013
Indenture_ "), issued by the Issuers to the Trustee; and

 

(d) that certain Indenture dated as of October 29, 2014 (as amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the " _2014 Indenture_
" and together with the 2012 Indenture and the 2013 Indenture, the "
_Indentures_ "), issued by the Issuers to the Trustee.

 

The QEPM Subsidiary Guarantors have guaranteed (i) the Loans made to the
Company and the other Obligations under the Credit Agreement or any other
Loan Document and (ii) all of obligations of the Issuers under the Indentures
and the related Notes (as defined under each such Indenture) (collectively,
the " _New Guarantee Obligations_ ").

 

Each QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor has requested that, subject to Section 11
below, its liabilities under the New Guarantee Obligations be limited to the
amount of financing that it has received through intercompany loans from the
Company.

Accordingly, the Company and each QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor agree as follows:

SECTION 1. _Indemnity and Subrogation._ In addition to all such rights of
indemnity and subrogation as the QEPM Subsidiary Guarantors may have under
applicable law (but subject to _Section 3_), the Company agrees that in the
event a payment shall be made by any QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor under any
guaranty relating to the Credit Agreement or any Indenture  pursuant to enforcement actions by the Administrative Agent or the Trustee,
respectively, the Company shall indemnify such QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor for
such payment in an amount equal to the Excess Amount (as defined below) if
such payment made by such QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor exceeds its Intercompany
Financing Benefit (as defined below) as of the date of such payment, and the
Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor to
whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of the Excess Amount. As
used in this Agreement and with respect to each QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor, the
term " _Intercompany Financing Benefit_ " shall mean, (i) $230,476,666.49
million, which is that portion of the purchase price paid by the Company for
QEPMs ultimate parent funded by Revolving Loans to reimburse the seller for
financing the repayment of QEPMs working capital facility, plus (ii) as of
any date of determination, the additional working capital financing provided
by the Company to the QEPM Subsidiary Guarantors from time to time after the
closing date of such acquisition, less any repayments of such financing from
the QEPM Subsidiary Guarantors to the Company from time to time, in each case
as evidenced by that certain Credit Agreement dated as of December 2, 2014, by
and between QEPM, as borrower, and QEP Field Services, LLC, as lender, and
any other intercompany loan agreements and notes, and the term " _Excess
Amount_ " shall be, if a positive number, the amount equal to (x) the
payment(s) made by such QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to the guaranties
relating to the Credit Agreement or the Indentures minus (y) its Intercompany
Financing Benefit as of the date of such payment(s). For clarity, any Excess
Amount of a QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor shall be calculated and computed without
duplication of any Excess Amount of any other QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor.

SECTION 2. _Contribution and Subrogation._ Each QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor
(a " _Contributing Subsidiary Guarantor_ ") agrees (subject to _Section 3_)
that, in the event a payment shall be made by any other QEPM Subsidiary
Guarantor under any guaranty for the Credit Agreement or an Indenture and
such other QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor (the " _Claiming Subsidiary Guarantor_
") shall not have been indemnified by the Company for any Excess Amount as
provided in _Section 1_, each Contributing Subsidiary Guarantor shall
indemnify the Claiming Subsidiary Guarantor in an amount equal to the amount
of such Excess Amount multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be
the net worth of the Contributing Subsidiary Guarantor on the date hereof or
on the date on which enforcement is being sought, whichever is greater, and
the denominator shall be the aggregate of the respective net worths of all the
QEPM Subsidiary Guarantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any QEPM
Subsidiary Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to _Section 12_, the
date of the Supplement (as defined in _Section 12_) hereto executed and
delivered by such QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor) or the date on which enforcement
is being sought, whichever is greater. Any Contributing Subsidiary Guarantor
making any payment to a Claiming Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to this
_Section 2_ shall be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Subsidiary
Guarantor under _Section 1_ to the extent of such payment.

SECTION 3. _Subordination._ Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, all rights of the QEPM Subsidiary Guarantors under _Sections
1_ and _2_ and all other rights of indemnity, contribution or subrogation
under applicable law or otherwise shall be fully subordinated and junior in
right of payment to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the
Obligations under the Loan Documents and the obligations under the Indentures
(whichever comes last). No failure on the part of the Company or any QEPM
Subsidiary Guarantor to make the payments required by  _Sections 1_ and _2_
(or any other payments required under applicable law or otherwise) shall in
any respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any QEPM Subsidiary

 



2  Guarantor with respect to its obligations hereunder, and each QEPM
Subsidiary Guarantor shall remain liable for the full amount of the
obligations of such QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder. The subordination
effected by this _Section 3_ shall prohibit (i) any exercise of a set-off in
respect of any subordinated obligations, (ii) the commencement of any action
seeking to enforce any subordinated obligations and (iii) the assignment of
any subordinated obligations. Any QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor receiving any
payment in respect of a subordinated obligation in violation of this _Section
3_ shall be deemed to have received such payment in trust for the benefit of
the Administrative Agent and the Issuer and immediately turn over such amount
(A) to the Administrative Agent for application in respect of the Obligations
until the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations and (B)
thereafter to the Issuer for application in respect of the obligations under
the Indentures until the indefeasible payment in full in cash of such
obligations.

 

SECTION 4. _Termination._ This Agreement shall survive and be in full force
and effect until the first to occur of (i) the date on which the Company owns
or acquires all (but not less than all) of the outstanding equity of QEP
Midstream Partners, LP, and (ii) the date on which all Obligations under the
Loan Documents and all obligations under or relating to the Indentures have
been indefeasibly paid in full in cash and the Commitments under the Credit
Agreement have been terminated. This Agreement shall continue to be effective
or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part
thereof, of any obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the
Trustee, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender or any QEPM
Subsidiary Guarantor upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company, any
QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor or otherwise.

SECTION 5. _GOVERNING LAW._ THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

SECTION 6\. _No Waiver; Amendment._ (a) No failure on the part of any QEPM
Subsidiary Guarantor to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right,
power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy by any QEPM
Subsidiary Guarantor preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or remedy. All remedies hereunder are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any other remedies provided by law. None
of the QEPM Subsidiary Guarantors shall be deemed to have waived any
rights hereunder unless such waiver shall be in writing and signed by such
parties.

(b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or
modified except pursuant to a written agreement entered into between the
Company and the QEPM Subsidiary Guarantors.

 

SECTION 7\. _Notices._ All communications and notices hereunder shall be in
writing and given as provided in the Loan Documents and addressed as
specified therein.

SECTION 8\. _Binding Agreement; Assignments._ Whenever in this Agreement any
of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to
include the successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises
and agreements by or on behalf of the parties that are

 



3  contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of their
respective successors and assigns. Neither the Company nor any QEPM Subsidiary
Guarantor may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the time any QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor is
released from its obligations under the Loan Documents and the Indentures,
such QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor will cease to have any rights or obligations
under this Agreement.

SECTION 9\. _Survival of Agreement; Severability._ (a) All covenants and
agreements made by the Company and QEPM Subsidiary Guarantors herein shall be
considered to have been relied upon by the Company, each other QEPM Subsidiary
Guarantor, and the Third Party Beneficiaries (as defined in Section 11 below)
and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or
any accrued interest or any other fee or amount payable under the Credit
Agreement, this Agreement, any Loan Document, the Indentures, or any document
relating to the Indentures is outstanding and unpaid and as long as the
Commitments under the Credit Agreement have not been terminated.

(b) In the event that any one or more of the provisions contained in this
Agreement should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained
herein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby (it being
understood that the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision
in any other jurisdiction). The parties shall endeavor in good-faith
negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with
valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to
that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

 

SECTION 10\. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which
shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall
constitute a single contract. This Agreement shall be effective with respect
to any QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor when a counterpart bearing the signature of
such QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor shall have been delivered to the Company.
Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or other
electronic transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually
signed counterpart of this Agreement.

SECTION 11. _Third Party Beneficiaries; Intercompany Agreement._ (a) The
provisions of this Agreement are intended solely for the purpose of defining
the rights and obligations of the Company and the QEPM Subsidiary Guarantors
to one another and are not intended to and do not create rights in any other
person or confer upon any other person any benefits, rights, or remedies, and
no person is or is intended to be a third party beneficiary of any of the
provisions of this Agreement, other than the Secured Parties, the Holders (as
defined in the Indentures), and the Trustee (such parties collectively, the "
_Third Party Beneficiaries_ ").

(b) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or will amend, waive or
otherwise modify the provisions of the Credit Agreement or any Indenture or
any guaranty relating to any of the foregoing. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to or will reduce, limit, or otherwise impair the obligations of the
Company or any QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor under the Credit Agreement or any
Indenture or any guaranty relating to any of the foregoing, which are absolute
and unconditional, to pay their obligations thereunder as and when the same
shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms.

 



4 SECTION 12\. _Additional QEPM Subsidiary Guarantors._ Pursuant to the
provisions of the Credit Agreement and the Indentures, certain Subsidiaries
of the Company that are not in existence or not a Subsidiary on the date
hereof are required to become guarantors to the Credit Agreement and the
Indentures from time to time. Upon execution and delivery, after the date
hereof, by such Subsidiaries of applicable joinder or supplements to the Loan
Documents and the Indentures and of an instrument in the form of Annex 1
hereto (the " _Supplement_ "), such Subsidiary shall become a QEPM Subsidiary
Guarantor hereunder with the same force and effect as if originally named as a
QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder. The execution and delivery of any
instrument adding an additional QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor as a party to this
Agreement shall not require the consent of any QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor
hereunder. The rights and obligations of each QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor
hereunder shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the addition
of any new QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor as a party to this Agreement.

SECTION 13. _Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process._  (a) Each QEPM
Subsidiary Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York
State court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New
York City, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the
extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect
any right that any Third Party Beneficiary may otherwise have to bring any
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement against any QEPM Subsidiary
Guarantor or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

 

(b) Each QEPM Subsidiary Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any
New York State or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such
court.

 

(c) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in
the manner provided for notices in _Section 7_. Nothing in this Agreement
will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any
other manner permitted by law.

 

SECTION 14. _Waiver of Jury Trial._ EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES
THAT NO

 



5  REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

 



6 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
executed by their duly authorized officers as of the date first appearing
above.

C. The Company and the QEPM Subsidiary Guarantors have entered into the

Accordingly, the New Subsidiary Guarantor agrees as follows:
