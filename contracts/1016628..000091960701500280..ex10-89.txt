                       authored  by or on  behalf  of  Parent  used by the  ALSS
                       Platform in combination with specific loan information in
                       the servicing of Australian Loans; and

                (xiv)  the books and records of the Selling Companies.

          (d)   For  illustrative  purposes  and to  evidence  the intent of the
                parties as to the  identity of the  Purchased  Assets,  Excluded
                Assets,  Assumed Liabilities and Excluded Liabilities,  Schedule
                2.01(d)  sets  forth a trial  balance  of the  foregoing  to the
                extent  that  they  are  reflected  on  a  balance  sheet  under
                generally  accepted  accounting  principles  as  applied  by the
                Sellers as of September 30, 2001.

          2.02  Consideration for Purchased Assets.

     In consideration  for the Purchased  Assets,  Buyer will assume the Assumed
Liabilities and will pay an amount (the "Purchase Price") equal to the Estimated
Purchase Price as subsequently adjusted by the Interim Settlement Amount and the
Purchase Price Adjustment. The Final Purchase Price will be paid as follows: (1)
at the Closing,  Buyer will pay to Sellers the Estimated Purchase Price, and (2)
on each of the  Interim  Settlement  Date  and the  Settlement  Date,  Buyer  or
Sellers,  as the case may be, will be entitled to the Interim  Settlement Amount


                                       20
<PAGE>

and the Purchase Price Adjustment, respectively. All payments under this Section
2.02  will be paid by  Sellers  or  Buyer,  as the case may be,  in  immediately
available federal funds to an account designated by the applicable  recipient of
such funds.

     As used herein:

     "Closing  Date Value" and  "Pre-Closing  Date Value" have the  meanings set
forth in Schedule 2.02.

     "Estimated  Purchase Price" means the sum of (1) the Pre-Closing Date Value
and (2) the  Franchise  Premium,  calculated in the manner set forth in Schedule
2.02.

     "Franchise Premium" means $25 million.

     "Purchase Price Adjustment" means (w) the Estimated Purchase Price plus (if
applicable) (x) the Interim  Settlement  Amount, if such amount is to be paid by
Buyer to Sellers,  minus (if applicable) (y) the Interim  Settlement  Amount, if
such  amount  is to be paid by  Sellers  to Buyer  minus  (z) the sum of (1) the
Closing Date Value and (2) the Franchise Premium, together with interest thereon
(after  adjusting  for any  interest  amount  previously  paid)  payable  at the
Interest  Rate  from  and  including  the  Closing  Date  to but  excluding  the
Settlement Date, calculated in the manner set forth in Schedule 2.02.

     2.03 Proration of Expenses.

     Except as  otherwise  specifically  provided in this  Agreement,  it is the
intention of the parties hereto that Sellers shall operate for their own account
the Business, until the Effective Time, and that Buyer shall operate for its own
account the  Business,  after the  Effective  Time.  Thus,  except as  otherwise
specifically  provided in this Agreement,  with respect to the Purchased  Assets
and  Assumed  Liabilities,  items of  expense,  including,  but not  limited to,
non-owner  occupation  fees,  payment of amounts  due under  service  contracts,
payments of rent, taxes,  utilities and other amounts required to be paid by the
tenant under leases,  and all personal property taxes applicable to the personal
property to be  transferred  hereunder,  shall be prorated to the Effective Time
and reflected on the Pre-Closing Date Value Calculation Schedule and the Closing
Date Value Calculation  Schedule.  An estimated settlement or settlements of all
such prorated items shall be made in accordance  with the procedures of Sections
2.02 and 2.04,  which estimated  settlement  shall include  reimbursement to the
Selling  Companies for any security  deposits  theretofore  made pursuant to any
lease which is assigned hereunder,  as well as any security deposits made by the
Selling Companies in respect of Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities,  all of
which  security  deposits  shall be held, on and after the Closing Date, for the
benefit of Buyer.  Sellers shall use commercially  reasonable  efforts to obtain
final bills for all items of expense  being  prorated  pursuant to this  Section
2.03 and any  adjustments  will be made in accordance with Schedule 2.02 and the
procedures of Section 2.05.

     2.04 Calculation of Purchase Price.

     (a) No later than ten  Business  Days prior to the  Closing  Date,  Sellers
shall deliver, or cause to be delivered,  to Buyer an unaudited schedule setting
out in reasonable  detail the basis of the calculation of the  Pre-Closing  Date
Value,  which calculation shall be as of the month-end for the month that is two
months prior to the month in which the Effective  Time occurs (the  "Pre-Closing
Date Value Calculation Schedule").

     (b) No later than 120 days after the Closing Date,  Sellers shall  deliver,
or  cause  to be  delivered,  to  Buyer an  unaudited  schedule  setting  out in
reasonable  detail the calculation of the Closing Date Value,  which calculation
shall  be  as of  the  Effective  Time  (the  "Closing  Date  Value  Calculation
Schedule").

     (c)  Unless  Buyer  delivers  written  notice to Sellers on or prior to the
later of (x) the 165th day  following the Closing Date or (y) the 45th day after
Buyer's  receipt of the Closing Date Value  Calculation  Schedule  specifying in
reasonable  detail the amount,  nature and basis of all  disputed  items,  Buyer
shall  be  deemed  to  have  accepted  and  agreed  to the  Closing  Date  Value
Calculation Schedule,  and such Closing Date Value Calculation Schedule shall be
deemed conclusive for purposes of determining the Final Purchase Price.

     (d) In the event that Buyer and Sellers are unable to agree with respect to
any item on the Closing Date Value Calculation Schedule within 45 days of notice
of the dispute and the dispute involves either (i) the mathematical  calculation
of the Closing Date Value or the Final  Purchase  Price or (ii) the  appropriate
accounting  treatment of any asset or  liability,  or item of income or expense,
that affects the  calculation of the Closing Date Value,  then Buyer and Sellers
will mutually agree to an independent  public accounting firm, which will make a
determination  of such  dispute (but not as to any other  matters)  based solely
upon not more than two rounds of presentations by Buyer and Sellers,  and not by
independent  review.  If Buyer and  Sellers are unable to agree on the choice of
the  independent  accounting  firm, the firm will be Ernst & Young LLP unless at
such time either Buyer or Sellers has a primary audit  relationship with Ernst &
Young LLP, in which case a "big-five"  accounting  firm (or  successor  thereof)
selected by lot (after  excluding  any firm with which  either  Buyer or Sellers
have a primary audit  relationship).  The findings of such firm,  which will not
exceed in amount the amount claimed by either party as to any matter in dispute,
shall be  conclusive  and binding  upon Buyer and  Sellers for  purposes of this
Agreement.  The fees and  expenses of such firm will be borne 50% by Sellers and
50% by Buyer.

     The provisions in this Section 2.04(d)  relating to resolutions of disputes
by an  accounting  firm are not  intended  to and  shall not be  interpreted  to
require that the parties  refer to such a firm (i) any dispute  arising out of a
breach by one of the parties of its  obligations  under the Agreement;  (ii) any
dispute the resolution of which requires the construction or  interpretation  of
this Agreement or (iii) any other dispute other than (in the case of this clause
(iii)) a dispute  related to the  mathematical  calculation  of the Closing Date


                                       22
<PAGE>

Value or the Final Purchase  Price or the  accounting  treatment of any asset or
liability,  or item of income or expense,  that affects the  calculation  of the
Closing Date Value.

     (e)  Buyer  and  Sellers  agree  that,  in  addition  to  their  respective
obligations  under Section  5.02(d),  prior to the Settlement Date, each of them
and their attorneys,  accountants, officers and other authorized representatives
(collectively,  "Representatives") shall have any and all reasonable access that
they each  reasonably  believe  is  necessary  to the books and  records  of the
Business,  the Purchased  Assets and the Assumed  Liabilities to the extent they
relate to the calculations  required or any dispute under this Section 2.04 (and
shall permit such  Representatives to examine and copy such books and records to
the extent  requested  by such party  provided  that all such copies are treated
confidentially  by such party and are only used for such  purposes  described in
this Section 2.04), and shall cause their  respective  officers and employees to
furnish all  information  requested by, and otherwise  cooperate with each other
with respect to access to any books,  records,  information  or other  documents
related to the calculations required by, or any dispute under this Section 2.04.

     2.05  Settlement Date Payments.

     On a date (the  "Settlement  Date")  within 5 days after the  acceptance by
Buyer of the Closing Date Value Calculation  Schedule  (whether  expressly or by
operation  of Section  2.04(c)) or the  resolution  of any  dispute  pursuant to
Section  2.04(d),  or such later date as the  parties may agree,  the  following
actions shall be taken:

     (a) If the Purchase Price Adjustment is a positive number, Sellers will pay
Buyer an amount equal to the Purchase  Price  Adjustment.  If the Purchase Price
Adjustment is a negative  number,  Buyer will pay Sellers an amount equal to the
absolute value of the Purchase Price Adjustment.

     (b) Each party shall take such other actions, and shall execute and deliver
such other instruments or documents, as shall be required in connection with the
determination and payment of the Final Purchase Price.

     2.06  Allocation of Purchase Price.

     Sellers and Buyer hereby agree to allocate the Final Purchase Price and the
Assumed  Liabilities  among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060
of the Code and file or cause to be filed in a timely  fashion  any  information
that may be required pursuant to regulations promulgated under the Code.

     2.07  No Offset.

     Neither Sellers or any of their  Affiliates,  on the one hand, nor Buyer or
any of its  Affiliates,  on the other hand,  shall have any set off or any other
similar  rights  with  respect  to (a) any of the funds  received  by such party
pursuant to this  Agreement or (b) any other  amounts  claimed to be owed to the


                                       23
<PAGE>

other  party  or its  Affiliates  arising  out of this  Agreement  or any  other
agreement.

     2.08  Interim Settlement.

     Within ten (10)  calendar days  following  the Closing  Date,  Sellers will
deliver to Buyer a good-faith  estimate of the Closing Date Value, such estimate
to be calculated in the manner set forth in Schedule  2.02. On the basis of such
good-faith  estimate of the Closing Date Value, and without being subject to any
challenge  or  dispute  on the part of Buyer,  and  without  any loss of Buyer's
rights under Section  2.04(d),  the parties will  determine  whether  Sellers or
Buyer is  required  to make a  payment  to the  other.  The  party  so  required
hereunder  to make a payment to the other shall pay,  within  five (5)  Business
Days following the date on which such payment amount is determined (the "Interim
Settlement  Date"),  one hundred  percent (100%) of such amount to be paid, plus
interest  on the  amount so paid at the  Interest  Rate from and  including  the
Closing  Date to but  excluding  the date of payment  (the  "Interim  Settlement
Amount"). The amounts, if any, required to be paid by either party under Section
2.05, including the interest payments thereunder,  shall be adjusted accordingly
to take into  account the interim  settlement  payment  made under this  Section
2.08.

     2.09  Co-Issue.

     Notwithstanding  anything  in this  Agreement  to the  contrary,  including
Article  II, if by the tenth day prior to the  Closing,  the Seller and Buyer do
not reach an agreement  (which they are not obligated to do) with respect to the
purchase and  assumption  by Buyer of the co-issue  arrangements  with Bank One,
Pulte and First Union  (Wachovia),  then each such  co-issue  arrangement  as to
which such an agreement  has not been reached  shall not be part of the Purchase
in any way and the Seller shall retain all interests in, and liabilities related
to, any such co-issue arrangement, and Buyer shall administer each relevant loan
relating  thereto for a $60 per loan set up fee and each  relevant loan relating
thereto shall be subserviced by Buyer in accordance with the Retained  Portfolio
Subservicing Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE III

                      Closing, Transfers and Related Items

     3.01  Closing and Closing Date.

     Unless  this  Agreement  shall have been  terminated  and the  transactions
herein abandoned  pursuant to Section 8.01, subject to the provisions of Article
VII, the closing (the  "Closing") of the purchase and sale of Purchased  Assets,
the  assumption  of the  Assumed  Liabilities  and the  payment  of the  amounts

Florida on (1) the first business day of the month  following the month in which
the last of the conditions set forth in Article VII has been satisfied or waived


                                       24
<PAGE>

in accordance with the terms of this Agreement  (other than those  conditions to
be satisfied or waived on the Closing Date,  unless the last of such  conditions
is satisfied or waived less than ten business  days prior to the end of a month,
in which event the Closing  Date shall  occur on the first  business  day of the
second succeeding  month), or (2) such other date to which the parties may agree
in writing.  The date on which the Closing  occurs is herein called the "Closing
Date".  The parties hereby agree that the effective time (the "Effective  Time")
of Closing for all purposes shall be at the opening of business in New York City
on the Closing Date or such other time as shall be agreed to by the parties.

     3.02  Assignment and Assumption Documents.

     (a) On the Closing Date, (i) the Selling  Companies and Buyer shall deliver
and  Parent  shall  cause the  Selling  Companies  to deliver a bill of sale and
instrument  of  assumption  of  liabilities  substantially  in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit F, (ii) the Selling  Companies  shall deliver and Parent shall
cause the Selling  Companies to deliver to Buyer such other instruments of sale,
assignment,  transfer and  conveyance  (including,  if necessary,  duly executed
powers of  attorney  to  transfer  all of the  shares  of stock of the  Acquired
Subsidiary),  and do such other acts as are  reasonably  necessary to effectuate
the sale,  transfer,  assignment  and delivery to Buyer of the right,  title and
interest of the Selling  Companies  in and to the  Purchased  Assets to be sold,
transferred,  assigned and  delivered to Buyer on such date  pursuant to Section
2.01(a)  free and clear of any Liens  other than  Permitted  Liens  except  that
clause (a) of such definition shall not apply immediately prior to the Effective
Time  and  (iii)  Buyer  shall  deliver  to the  Selling  Companies  such  other
instruments  of  assumption,  and do or cause to be done by third  parties  such
other acts as are reasonably  necessary to effectuate the assumption by Buyer of
the Assumed  Liabilities to be assumed by Buyer on such date pursuant to Section
2.01(b).

     (b) Without limiting the foregoing,  on or before the Closing Date, Sellers
shall,  at their expense,  promptly take each such action as may be necessary to
transfer all of the Selling  Companies' right,  title and interest in and to the
Acquired Warehouse Loans,  including (i) endorsing or causing to be endorsed the
related Mortgage Notes to Buyer without  recourse,  (ii) preparing or causing to
be prepared Assignments of Mortgage Instruments, assigning the related Mortgages
from the Selling  Companies to Buyer and preparing or causing to be prepared all
prior intervening  Assignments of Mortgage Instruments as reasonably required by
Buyer and (iii)  assigning  nominal  title to the other  related  Mortgage  Loan
Documents  to Buyer.  To the extent  required  by  applicable  Regulations  with
respect to Mortgage Loans,  Sellers will, at their expense,  record or cause the
recordation  of  the  Assignments  of  Mortgage  Instruments  from  the  Selling
Companies to Buyer.  In addition,  Sellers will, at their  expense,  prepare and
record,  or cause the preparation  and  recordation of,  Assignments of Mortgage
Instruments  from Buyer to the  applicable  Investor  to the extent  required by
applicable Regulations. Sellers shall provide to Buyer such recorded Assignments
of Mortgage Instruments as soon as practicable.

     3.03 Further Assistance and Assurances.

     Sellers  shall,  at any  time and from  time to  time,  promptly,  upon the
reasonable request of Buyer, execute, acknowledge,  deliver or perform, all such
further acts, deeds, assignments,  transfers, conveyances, and assurances as may
be required for the better  vesting and  conferring  to Buyer of title in and to
the  Purchased  Assets  and to  effect  the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement.  Buyer shall, at any time and from time to time,  promptly,  upon the
reasonable request of Sellers,  execute,  acknowledge,  deliver or perform,  all
such further acts, deeds, assumption agreements, transfers and assurances as may
be  required  for the full  assumption  and  transfer  to  Buyer of the  Assumed
Liabilities and to effect the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. Each
party agrees that if it receives any payment or amount after the Closing Date to
which another  party is entitled,  the recipient  shall  promptly  transfer such
payment or amount to the party so entitled.  At the Effective  Time, the Sellers
shall,  and Parent shall cause the Selling  Companies  to,  transfer and deliver
possession  and control of the ALSS  Platform to Buyer,  including all copies of
source code and documentation and physical and electronic access to all systems.

     3.04 Other Consents.

     Sellers shall take all commercially reasonable action, at no cost to Buyer,
to obtain such other Third Party  Consents as are  necessary to permit the sale,
transfer, assignment and conveyance to Buyer of the Purchased Assets. Nothing in
this  Agreement  shall be  construed  as an attempt or  agreement  to assign any
Purchased  Asset or Assumed  Liability  which is not  capable  of being  validly
assigned,  conveyed or transferred  without the consent of a third party, unless
such consent shall have been obtained and remain in full force and effect at the
Closing. If such consent in respect of a Purchased Asset or an Assumed Liability
is not obtained prior to the Closing or does not remain in full force and effect
at the Closing,  Buyer and Sellers will use  reasonable  efforts,  at no cost to
Buyer, to enter into a mutually  agreeable,  reasonable and lawful  arrangement,
including,  subcontracting,  sublicensing or subleasing, under which Buyer would
obtain the benefit and assume the  obligations in respect thereto from and after
the Closing Date in accordance with this Agreement,  and under which the Selling
Companies  would  enforce  for the  benefit of Buyer any and all rights of Buyer
against a third party thereto,  with Buyer assuming the  obligations to the same
extent as if they would have constituted an Assumed Liability.

disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one
or more  representations or warranties contained in Section 4.02 or Section 4.03
or to one or more of the covenants  contained in Article V;  provided,  however,
that the  inclusion  of an item in a  Disclosure  Schedule as an  exception to a
representation,  warranty or covenant will not be deemed an admission by a party

     aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business or on Sellers.  As
     of the  date  hereof,  Sellers  have no  Knowledge  of any  reason  why the
     approvals  or  consents  set forth as  conditions  to closing  in  Sections

     valid  leasehold  interest),  free and clear of any Liens  (other  than (A)
     Liens that were Previously Disclosed; (B) mechanics', carriers', workmen's,
     repairmen's or other like Liens arising or incurred in the ordinary  course
     of  business  and Liens for Taxes that are not due and  payable or that may
     thereafter  be  paid  without  penalty;  and (C)  Liens  created  by  Buyer
     (collectively, "Permitted Liens"). Other than persons having an interest in
     Permitted Liens that have been Previously  Disclosed,  no person other than
     Sellers and the  Selling  Subsidiaries  has any  interest in (i) any of the
     Purchased  Assets  transferred  to  Buyer  hereunder  (provided  that  this
     representation  and  warranty  does  not  apply  to  Acquired  Intellectual
     Property,  Acquired  Intellectual  Property  Licenses and leases of real or
     personal  property) or (ii)  Sellers'  leasehold  interest in any leases of
     real or personal property  included in the Purchased Assets  transferred to
     Buyer hereunder.

         (2) Subject to the receipt of any required  Third Party  Consents,  the
     Purchased   Assets   together  with  Buyer's   rights  under  the  Acquired
     Intellectual Property Licenses,  and Ancillary Agreements are sufficient to
     operate the Business as it is conducted as of the date hereof and to permit
     Buyer to perform in the ordinary course of business its  obligations  under
     the Ancillary Agreements consistent with the standards set forth therein.

     (e) Litigation. Sellers have Previously Disclosed a true and complete list,
as of the date hereof,  of all  litigation,  claims,  actions,  arbitrations  or
investigations  or other proceedings  before any Governmental  Authority pending
(or, to Sellers' Knowledge, threatened in writing) against the Selling Companies
with respect to the Business or relating to or  involving  any of the  Purchased
Assets or Assumed  Liabilities of the Selling Companies (except for prosecutions
of applications for  registrations of intellectual  property or similar rights).
To Sellers'  Knowledge there does not exist any fact or circumstance  that would
be reasonably  expected to give rise to any such  litigation,  claims,  actions,
arbitrations or  investigations  or other  proceedings.  Except for matters that


                                       29

would not  reasonably  be  expected  to have a  Material  Adverse  Effect on the
Business  or  Sellers,  no  other  litigation,   claim,   action,   arbitration,
investigation or other proceeding before any Governmental  Authority (except for
prosecutions  of applications  for  registrations  of  intellectual  property or
similar  rights) is pending  against the Selling  Companies  with respect to the
Business,  or relating to or involving  any of the  Purchased  Assets or Assumed
Liabilities of the Selling Companies and, to Sellers'  Knowledge,  no other such
litigation,  claim, action,  arbitration,  investigation or other proceeding has
been threatened in writing nor, to Sellers' Knowledge, does there exist any fact
or  circumstance  that  would be  reasonably  expected  to give rise to any such
litigation,   claims,   actions,   arbitrations  or   investigations   or  other
proceedings.  In addition,  except as Previously Disclosed, no other litigation,
claim,  action,  arbitration,  investigation  or  other  proceeding  before  any
Governmental   Authority   (except  for   prosecutions   of   applications   for
registrations of intellectual property or similar rights) is pending against the
Acquired  Subsidiary,  or  relating  to  or  involving  any  of  its  assets  or
liabilities and, to Sellers' Knowledge, no other such litigation, claim, action,
arbitration,  investigation  or other  proceeding has been threatened in writing
nor, to Sellers' Knowledge, does there exist any fact or circumstance that would
be reasonably  expected to give rise to any such  litigation,  claims,  actions,
arbitrations or investigations or other proceedings.

     (f) Regulatory Matters. None of Sellers or the Selling Companies is a party
to or is subject to any  outstanding  order,  decree,  agreement,  memorandum of
understanding or similar supervisory arrangement with, or a commitment letter or
similar submission to, or extraordinary  supervisory letter from, any federal or
state  governmental   agency  or  authority  charged  with  the  supervision  or
regulation of banks and their holding companies, or mortgage banking (including,
without  limitation,  the Federal Reserve Board, the VA, FHA, FNMA,  FHLMC, GNMA
and HUD) or the  supervision  or regulation of the Selling  Companies  (each,  a
"Regulatory Authority") except any such regulatory action that would not have in
the aggregate a Material Adverse Effect on the Business or on Sellers.

     (g) Compliance with Laws.

         (1) The Business is being  conducted in compliance  with all applicable
     federal, state, local and foreign statutes, laws, regulations,  ordinances,
     rules,  judgments,  orders or decrees applicable thereto ("Applicable Law")
     except  where any failure to comply with  Applicable  Law would not have in
     the aggregate a Material Adverse Effect on the Business or on Sellers; and

         (2) The Selling Companies hold all permits,  licenses,  authorizations,
     orders  and  approvals  of,  and have made all  filings,  applications  and
     registrations with, all Governmental Authorities that are required in order
     to own or lease the  Purchased  Assets and to conduct  the  Business in all
     material  respects as  presently  conducted;  all such  permits,  licenses,
     certificates  of  authority,  orders  and  approvals  are in full force and
     effect and, to Sellers' Knowledge,  no suspension or cancellation of any of
     them has been threatened in writing.

                Contract  in any  material  respect  and  (iii)  there  has  not
                occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of
                notice or both, would constitute such a default except where any
                failure  to comply  would not have in the  aggregate  a Material
                Adverse Effect on the Business or on Sellers.

     (i) No Brokers. No action has been taken by any Seller that would give rise
to any valid claim against any party hereto for a brokerage commission, finder's

     (k) Real Property.

           (1) Sellers have Previously Disclosed all real property and leasehold

     Permitted Liens, (B) subleases and similar agreements Previously Disclosed,
     (C) easements,  covenants,  rights-of-way and other similar restrictions of
     record which do not materially  interfere with the Selling Company's use of

     current,  accurate survey or physical  inspection of any real property made
     prior to the Closing Date and (E) (i) zoning,  building  and other  similar
     restrictions,  (ii) Liens that have been placed by any developer,  landlord

     possessed and controlled by such Selling Company.

           (2) Each lease or agreement under which a Selling Company is a lessee
     or  lessor  of any  property,  real or  personal,  is a valid  and  binding
     agreement  of such  Selling  Company,  and no  event  has  occurred  and is
     continuing which, with or without notice or lapse of time, would constitute
     a material  default or event of default by such Selling  Company  under any


                                       32

     thereto.

     (l) Insurance.  Sellers have Previously Disclosed all policies of insurance
relating to the Purchased  Assets and the Business  (other than title  insurance
policies or insurance policies relating  exclusively to mortgages or other loans
originated or serviced by the Selling  Companies)  that name any Selling Company
as an  insured  party  thereunder.  Except  as  Previously  Disclosed,  all such
policies are with reputable  insurers  against such risks and in such amounts as
the management of the Selling Companies  reasonably has determined to be prudent
in accordance with industry  practices.  All such insurance policies are in full
force and effect, the Selling Companies are not in material default  thereunder,
and all claims thereunder have been filed in due and timely fashion.

     (m) ALSS Platform.

         (1)  Disclosure.   All  material  Software  systems  and  modules,  and
     telecommunications and computer equipment comprising the ALSS Platform, and
     all Acquired  Intellectual  Property Licenses and service contracts related
     thereto,  have been  Previously  Disclosed  in  Section  4.02(m)(1)  of the
     Disclosure Schedule (except for generally available "shrinkwrap",  over-the
     counter,  "clickwrap"  and other similar  licenses that are not  enterprise
     licenses).

         (2) Rights to Use. The Selling  Companies have sufficient  Intellectual
     Property  rights to use all Third Party  Software that is being used by the
     Selling Companies related to the ALSS Platform as currently used by them in
     connection  with the  Business by means of Acquired  Intellectual  Property
     Licenses.

         (3) Title.  The Selling  Companies have exclusive  ownership and use of
     the ALSS  Platform in its  entirety  (i.e.  , taken as a whole as currently
     used by them in connection  with the Business)  which ownership and use are
     free  of  all  liens,   encumbrances   and  claims   including  claims  for
     infringement except as Previously  Disclosed concerning those ALSS Platform
     components  licensed to the Selling  Companies by third Persons pursuant to
     Acquired Intellectual Property Licenses.

         (4) Noninfringement. The ALSS Platform as currently used by the Selling
     Companies  does not  violate  or  infringe  the  Intellectual  Property  or
     proprietary rights of any other Person except as Previously  Disclosed.  In
     the three (3) years preceding this Agreement,  there has not been any suit,
     action or other proceeding,  and to Sellers' Knowledge,  no suit, action or
     other  proceeding is pending or  threatened,  against them  concerning  any
     claim  that  the ALSS  Platform  infringes  or  violates  the  Intellectual
     Property rights of any other Person,  or that any of the Selling  Companies
     has breached any Acquired  Intellectual Property License. No claim has been
     asserted  in writing  against any of the  Selling  Companies  that the ALSS
     Platform  infringes or violates  the  Intellectual  Property  rights of any
     other  Person,  or that  any of the  Selling  Companies  has  breached  any
     Acquired Intellectual Property License. There exists no event, condition or


                                       33
<PAGE>

     occurrence  which,  with the  giving of  notice or lapse of time,  or both,
     would constitute a material breach by any of the Selling  Companies,  or to
     Sellers'  Knowledge,   another  Person,  under  any  Acquired  Intellectual
     Property License.  No party to any Acquired  Intellectual  Property License
     has given any of the Selling  Companies  notice of its intention to cancel,
     terminate or fail to renew any such Acquired Intellectual Property License.
     To Sellers'  Knowledge,  no Person is  infringing  or violating  any of the
     Acquired Intellectual Property in the ALSS Platform.

         (5)  Trademarks.  The ALSS  Platform does not consist of or include any
     Marks.

         (6)  Patents.  Sellers do not own any right,  title or  interest in any
     Patents covering any component of the ALSS Platform.

         (7)  Copyrights.  Section  4.02(m)(7) of Sellers'  Disclosure  Schedule
     contains  a complete  and  accurate  list and  summary  description  of all
     registered  Copyrights owned by the Selling  Companies that are part of the
     ALSS Platform,  which  registrations  are currently in compliance  with all
     formal  legal  requirements,  and to  Sellers'  Knowledge,  are  valid  and
     enforceable, and are not subject to any maintenance fees or actions falling
     due within ninety days after the date of Closing.

         (8)  Trade Secrets. The following  representations  are solely made for
     Trade Secrets that are part of the ALSS Platform.

         (i)    The  documentation  relating  to the ALSS  Platform  is current,
                accurate  and  sufficient  in detail and content to identify and
                explain it and to allow its full and proper use.

         (ii)   Sellers have taken commercially reasonable precautions necessary
                to  protect  the  secrecy,  confidentiality  and  value  of  the
                Software in the ALSS Platform as a trade secret.

         (iii)  To  Sellers'  Knowledge,  the Trade  Secrets are not part of the
                public  knowledge or literature  and have not been  disclosed to
                any Person (other than Parent,  the Selling  Companies and their
                employees,  counsel and other agents,  and other Persons who are
                bound by written confidentiality  obligations to Sellers or have
                otherwise been advised of their  confidentiality  obligations to
                Sellers).

         (iv)   Since  1993,  all  employees  hired and  consultants  engaged by
                Sellers,  and, to Sellers'  Knowledge,  all employees  hired and
                consultants   engaged  by  the   predecessors   of  the  Selling
                Companies,  who had access to the Software in the ALSS  Platform
                have  signed  a   confidentiality   agreement   in  the  Selling
                Companies' standard form (for employees hired by and consultants


                                       34
<PAGE>

                engaged by the Selling  Companies),  as certified by the Selling
                Companies  and  delivered  to Buyer,  and except as disclosed in
                Section  4.02(m)(8)(iv) of the Disclosure Schedule,  the Selling
                Companies  are  not  aware  of  any  breaches  of  any  of  such
                agreements. To Sellers' Knowledge, the employment by the Selling
                Companies  of any of  such  employees  and  engagement  of  such
                consultants,  and their duties for the Selling Companies, do not
                violate any non-disclosure or non-competition  agreement between
                an employee and a third party.

         (9)  Software.  The  following  representations  are  solely  made  for
Software that is part of the ALSS Platform.

                third party Software ("Third Party Programs")  currently used by
                the  Selling  Companies  as part of the ALSS  Platform,  and all
                copies of such Third Party  Programs are licensed to the Selling
                Companies under valid written license agreements;

         (ii)   Copies  of  all  the  license,   distribution   and  maintenance
                agreements  for the Third Party  Programs  have been provided by
                Sellers to Buyer, except in respect of Third Party Programs that
                are covered by shrinkwrapped, clickwrapped or similar agreements
                for Third  Party  Programs  software  that  have been  purchased
                off-the-shelf  by the Selling  Companies  in order to be used by
                the  Selling  Companies,   and  such  license  and  distribution
                agreements  give  the  Selling  Companies  the  right  to  grant
                unlimited  run-time  licenses  of  the  respective  Third  Party
                Program;

         (iii)  Recipients  of services  utilizing the ALSS Platform do not have
                access to or the  right or  ability  to  possess  any  object or
                source  code  of the  ALSS  Platform,  and no  Person  has  been
                provided  with a copy of the  object  code of the ALSS  Platform
                Software (except as Section 4.02(m)(8)(iv) contemplates);

         (iv)   Except  as  disclosed  in  Section  4.02(m)(9)(iv)  of  Sellers'
                Disclosure Schedule,  all copies in all media of the source code
                are currently  stored only in Sellers'  premises in San Antonio,
                Texas and all files containing  source code have been identified
                to Buyer. To Sellers' Knowledge, the transaction contemplated by
                this Agreement will not itself entitle any Person except for the
                rights  of  Parent  under  the   Intellectual   Property  Rights
                Agreement to obtain a copy of the source code for the Software;

         (v)    Except as listed in Section 4.02(m)(9)(v) of Sellers' Disclosure
                Schedule,  there are no problems or defects in the ALSS Platform

                Platform  Software  to  operate  as  described  in  the  related
                documentation or  specifications,  or as otherwise  warranted to
                any third party, in each case that are specifically known by the
                Selling  Companies,  and, except for such disclosed  problems or
                defects,   the  Software   operates  in   accordance   with  its
                specifications;

         (vi)   Section   4.02(m)(9)(vi)   of   Sellers'   Disclosure   Schedule
                accurately  describes the current material development plans and
                schedule  for the  ALSS  Platform  Software  and  discloses  and
                describes all material internal plans and external  commitments,
                and  commitments  to Parent,  to  enhance  or  improve  the ALSS
                Platform  Software,  and all related budgets and schedules,  and
                except  as  disclosed  in  Section  4.02(m)(9)(vi)  of  Sellers'
                Disclosure  Schedule,  all  projects  there  described  are  not
                materially over budget or behind schedule;

         (vii)  There are not now nor have  there  ever  been any  distributors,
                sales agents,  representatives  or any other persons,  including
                VARs, OEMs or resellers, who have rights from Sellers under oral
                or written  agreements  to market or license  the ALSS  Platform
                Intellectual Property, or the Software in the ALSS Platform; and

         (viii) Sellers  have  disclosed  to Buyer  all  reports,  analyses  and
                investigations  performed by Sellers or consultants  retained by
                Sellers  concerning  the  capacity  of the ALSS  Platform  to be
                extended to service  additional  mortgage loans and Sellers have
                no reason to  believe  that the  conclusions  reflected  in such

to Sellers,  Buyer shall place such amounts in an interest bearing account,  and
any interest earned thereon shall be for the benefit of Sellers.  With each such
remittance  Buyer  shall  deliver a report  with  respect  to the  status of the
Retained Accounts Receivable in form reasonably satisfactory to Sellers. Sellers
and their  accountants  and other  advisors  shall be given  full  access at all
reasonable  times  to all  books  and  records  necessary  to  perform  an audit
regarding Buyer's collections with respect to the Retained Accounts Receivable.

or  negotiations  commenced prior to the date of this Agreement with any parties
other than Buyer with respect to the sale of the Business as a whole. Nothing in
this  provision  shall  prohibit  the sale of the Retained  Servicing  Portfolio
provided that the Selling Companies comply with the procedures of Section 8.4 of
the  Retained  Portfolio  Subservicing  Agreement  as if  such  provisions  were
operative and in effect.

basis with all its Affiliates is the Restricted Business.

     (b) For a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, Buyer shall

however,  that this  Section  5.11 shall not apply (a) if any such  employee has
been  terminated  by Buyer or any of its  Affiliates  for any reason,  or by the
Selling  Companies  during the Lease  Period at  Buyer's  request or (b) if such
employee is hired by a Seller or any of its  Affiliates as a result of a general

solicit for  employment  any person who is then employed by any Selling  Company
holding  the  title  of vice  president  or  higher  or (b)  use  any  material,
information  or document  obtained in connection  with the entering into of this
Agreement  directly or  indirectly  to solicit  any  customer or supplier of any

Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VIII as a result of a willful breach
by Sellers,  the  restrictions  set forth in clause (a) of the first sentence of
this Section 5.11(b) shall terminate on January 2, 2003.

     5.12 Transitional Matters.

     (a) Each of the parties  acknowledges and agrees that the transition of the
Business  from  the  Selling  Companies  to  Buyer  will  require  that  certain
transactions and  relationships  will need to be entered into,  restructured and
reorganized  in connection  with the transition of the Business from the Selling
Companies  to Buyer.  The  parties  agree that prior to the  Closing  Date,  the
parties shall  cooperate with each other to identify all such  transactions  and
relationships  and  negotiate in good faith to enter into a mutually  acceptable
Transitional  Agreement  effective as of the Closing Date, which agreement shall
provide for all such transactions and relationships as are reasonably  necessary

               from Parent and its Affiliates (including the Selling Companies),
               in each  case  during  the  period  commencing  on and  after the
               Closing Date and ending no later than the one year anniversary of
               the Closing Date or such longer  period as the parties may agree,
               including the following:

     Agreement and the Services  Agreement) to the Parent and its  Affiliates to
     Intellectual   Property  currently  owned  (or  licensed)  by  the  Selling
     Companies (and included in the Purchased  Assets) and used by Parent or the
     Selling Companies in the ordinary course of their business,  or required by
     the Selling  Companies for the operation and use of the Excluded  Assets or
     Excluded Liabilities;  provided, that access to the ALSS Platform and other
     Software  shall be  governed  solely by the  Intellectual  Property  Rights
     Agreement  and the  Services  Agreement  and,  provided  further,  anything
     foregoing to the contrary  notwithstanding,  Buyer shall not be required to
     disclose or deliver trade secret or confidential  information regarding the
     ALSS Platform,  Software or Acquired  Intellectual Property unless required
     by the Intellectual  Property Rights Agreement,  the Services  Agreement or
     required  by law or legal  proceedings  and  under  the type of  protective
     provisions in the Intellectual Property Rights Agreement.

          (3) the  provision  of rights of access (to the extent not  covered by
     the  Intellectual  Property  Rights  Agreement)  to Buyer  to  Intellectual
     Property currently owned (or licensed) by Parent (or the Selling Companies)
     and used by the Selling  Companies in connection with the Purchased  Assets
     or Assumed Liabilities;

          (4) moving corporate records related to the Selling Companies; and

          (5) the  provision of office  space,  computer  equipment and supplies

         (ii) for  such  services   and   facilities   as  Sellers  and  Selling
              Subsidiaries   may  require  to  monitor   compliance   with,  and
              implementation  of the  Subservicing  Agreement,  during its term,
              including the provision of office  space,  computer  equipment and
              supplies  sufficient to enable Sellers to monitor  compliance with
              the Retained Portfolio Subservicing Agreement throughout its term.

          (b) In addition to the matters to be identified  pursuant to paragraph
     (a) of this Section  5.12,  the  Transition  Agreement  shall  specifically
     provide  for the  transactions  and  matters  outlined  in Section  5.12 of
     Sellers' Disclosure Schedule.

          (c) For the purpose of  facilitating  the  transition of the financial
     system,  on or prior to the 15th day prior to the Closing Date, the Selling
     Companies shall create on their general ledger,  a separate  general ledger
     company ("GL Company"),  as well as accounts for such GL Company ("Buyer GL
     Accounts"),  which accounts shall be duplicative of the Selling  Companies'
     own  accounts  ("Seller GL  Accounts")  and are  intended to be used by the
     Buyer in the  operation  of the  Business,  the  Purchased  Assets  and the
     Assumed  Liabilities  from and after the Closing  Date.  From and after the
     creation of the Buyer GL Accounts,  until  Closing,  the Selling  Companies
     shall  maintain  such  accounts (as  duplicate  entries on the books of the
     Selling  Companies in the name of the GL Company).  From and after  Closing


                                       55
<PAGE>

     until the  completion  of the  transition  of the  financial  system of the
     Selling  Companies,  the Buyer  shall  operate the  Business  by  recording
     entries  using the Buyer GL Accounts,  and shall  maintain on behalf of the
     Selling Companies, the Seller GL Accounts on its general ledger.

          (d) The party receiving service under the Transitional Agreement shall
     pay to the party  providing  service the costs  incurred by such  providing
     party.  Services  provided  under  the  Transitional   Agreement  shall  be
     performed at the same standard as the providing party performs such service
     for its own account.

          5.13 MSR  Purchases  by Buyer.  From and after  January 1, 2002 to the
     Closing Date,  any purchases by Buyer of mortgage  servicing  rights or the
     purchase of any  business  principally  engaged in the  Servicing  of FNMA,
     FHLMC or GNMA residential  mortgage loan servicing rights shall comply with
     the  procedures  in  Section  8.4 of the  Retained  Portfolio  Subservicing
     Agreement as if such provision were operative and in effect.

          5.14 Damage or Deterioration of 7301 Baymeadows Way.

          Prior to the Closing, Sellers and the Selling Companies shall maintain
     all existing  insurance  policies in respect of 7301 Baymeadows Way. In the
     event of any damage to 7301 Baymeadows Way that results in a recovery under
     such  insurance  policies  prior to the  Closing,  Sellers  and the Selling
     Companies shall transfer the proceeds thereof to Buyer and, for purposes of
     Article II, the Closing Date Value of 7301 Baymeadows Way shall not reflect
     any  changes  arising  out of, or in  connection  with,  such damage to the
     extent covered by insurance or condemnation proceeds.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                                Employee Matters

          6.01 Employees and Service Crediting.

          (a) Offer of Employment  with Buyer.  Within 90 days after the Closing
     Date, but in no event later than the date that is 20 days before the end of
     the Lease  Period,  Buyer shall make a written  offer of employment to each
     Prospective  Employee and,  subject to subsection (c) below,  to each Leave
     Recipient,  which offer shall  include  (i) total cash  compensation  until
     December 31, 2002 that is Comparable Cash  Compensation,  where "Comparable
     Cash  Compensation"  means  cash  compensation  that  in the  aggregate  is
     comparable to the total cash compensation  (including,  but not limited to,
     short-term  and long-term  bonus  opportunities  and  commission/incentives
     opportunities)  provided by the Selling  Companies to the relevant employee
     as of the Closing,  and (ii) the covenant of Buyer set forth in subsections
     6.01(d)(ii),  6.01(e),  6.01(f) and 6.01(g)  below.  The Selling  Companies
     shall  cooperate  with and use  reasonable  efforts to assist  Buyer in its
     efforts to secure reasonably  satisfactory employment arrangements with the


                                       56
<PAGE>

     Prospective  Employees.  Each  Prospective  Employee who does not reject an
     offer of  employment  with Buyer  shall  become an employee of Buyer on the
     last day of the  employee  leasing  period,  if any,  with  respect to such
     Prospective Employee, in the Employee Lease (the "Lease Period"), and shall
     be referred to herein as a "Transferred Employee".

          (b)  Adjustment  of  Prospective   Employees  for  Subsequently  Hired
     Employees.  Prior to the Closing Date, the Selling  Companies shall furnish
     to Buyer an updated list of all Prospective  Employees as of a date that is
     approximately 30 days prior to the Closing,  which list shall indicate each
     Prospective Employee's prior service, projected to the Closing Date.

          (c) Special Provisions for Leave Recipients.

              (1) With respect to any  Prospective  Employee who is not actively
          at work on the  Closing  Date as a  result  of  short-term  disability
          leave,   or  other  approved   personal  leave   (including,   without
          limitation,  military leave with reemployment rights under federal law
          and leave under the Family  Medical Leave Act of 1993)  (collectively,
          the "Leave Recipients") Buyer will explain to Leave Recipients Buyer's
          intention  to make an offer of  employment  in the manner  required by
          Section 6.01(a)  contingent on such Prospective  Employee's  return to
          active status at the  termination of such disability or approved leave
          of absence,  respectively,  provided  that he or she returns to active
          service before the later of (A) the end of the Lease Period or (B) the
          date such employee's  reemployment rights expire under applicable laws
          or under the Compensation and Benefit Plans.

              (2) When the Leave Recipient  returns to active status pursuant to
          the  terms  of  clause  (1)  above,  such  Leave  Recipient  shall  be
          considered a Transferred Employee (as defined above) and the following
          provisions  shall apply: (A) the Leave Recipient shall become eligible
          for coverage and benefits under all employee benefit plans or programs
          maintained by Buyer under the same terms and conditions  that apply to
          other Transferred  Employees;  and (B) the Leave Recipient's period of
          leave  shall be  treated  as a period of  service  under the  employee
          benefit plans and programs of Buyer to the same extent as if the Leave
          Recipient had received benefits under a similar plan or was subject to
          a similar  policy of  Selling  Companies  except  to the  extent  such
          service  credit  will result in  duplication  of benefits to the Leave
          Recipient.

          (d) Buyer Benefit Obligation.

              (i)  Buyer shall  establish and maintain,  until at least December
                   31, 2002,  employee  benefit  plans,  programs,  policies and
                   arrangements for Transferred Employees which provide benefits
                   to the  Transferred  Employees  that are no less favorable in
                   the aggregate to those  provided to them under the applicable
                   Compensation and Benefit Plans in effect on the Closing Date.


                                       57
<PAGE>


              (ii) Notwithstanding the above aggregation, (A) Buyer shall accept
                   assignment, and assume, from Sellers, all agreements to which
                   any  Prospective  Employee  is a party  and (B)  Buyer  shall
                   provide  severance pay and benefits pursuant to the severance
                   terms set forth in  Section  6.01(d) of  Sellers'  Disclosure
                   Schedule,  to Prospective  Employees whose employment becomes
                   terminated  under  circumstances  set forth  therein from the
                   Closing Date until July 1, 2003.

          (e)  Recognition  of Service.  For purposes of  eligibility,  vesting,
     vacation  entitlement  and severance  benefits and benefit accrual for sick
     leave under all  employee  compensation  and benefit  plans of Buyer,  each
     Transferred  Employee  shall  receive  full credit from Buyer for all prior
     service  properly  credited  under  the  Compensation  and  Benefit  Plans;
     provided,  however, that for purposes of Buyer's cash balance pension plan,
     each Transferred  Employee shall receive such prior service credit only for
     the period  between the Closing Date and the end of the Lease  Period.  The
     schedule  of  service  provided  by  Sellers  prior to the end of the Lease
     Period may be  conclusively  relied upon by Buyer in  crediting  service in
     accordance with this Section 6.01(b).

          (f) Welfare Plans and Other Unfunded Plans. Buyer shall offer coverage
     under  employer-sponsored  medical and dental plans and agree to cause each
     of such medical and dental plans that  provides  coverage to a  Transferred
     Employee  to (A) waive any  pre-existing  conditions,  waiting  periods and
     actively at work requirements under such plans, and (B) cause such plans to
     honor any expenses  (including any expenses paid for purposes of satisfying
     applicable  deductibles,  co-insurance  and maximum  out-of-pocket  limits)
     incurred by the Transferred Employees and their beneficiaries under similar
     plans of the  Selling  Companies  during the portion of the  calendar  year
     prior to the Closing Date for purposes of satisfying  applicable deductible
     and maximum out-of-pocket expenses under Buyer's plans.

          (g) Time Off. On the Closing Date, the Selling Companies shall pay out
     to each  Prospective  Employee  an  amount  in cash  equal  to the time off
     benefits  earned but not yet used by such  employee as of the Closing Date,
     if  any.  In  addition,  the  Selling  Companies  shall  pay  out  to  each
     Prospective Employee an amount in cash equal to the time off benefit earned
     but not used during the Lease  Period,  if any (the "Lease Time Off Cash").
     Buyer shall reimburse the Selling Companies  pursuant to the Employee Lease
     for the Lease Time Off Cash as part of the Base Fee (as  defined in Section
     3.1(a) of the Employee Lease).  Buyer shall waive any service  requirements
     or other applicable internal guidelines,  to allow Transferred Employees to
     take unpaid time off from Buyer up to the number of days represented by the
     Lease  Time Off  Cash,  beginning  immediately  after  the end of the Lease
     Period,  subject  to a  department  manager's  request  to meet  reasonable
     business needs.

          (h) WARN Act and Health Care Continuance Requirements.  Buyer shall be
     responsible  for  providing  or  discharging  any  and  all  notifications,
     benefits,   and  liabilities  to  Transferred  Employees  and  Governmental


                                       58
<PAGE>

     Authorities  required  by  the  WARN  Act or by any  other  applicable  law
     relating to plant  closings or employee  separations  or severance pay that
     are first  required to be provided  or  discharged  on or after the Closing
     Date, including pre-closing notice or liabilities if actions by Buyer on or
     after the Closing Date result in a notice  requirement  or liability  under
     such laws. Upon Buyer's reasonable request, during the Lease Period Selling
     Companies  shall provide any  notification  described under the WARN Act to
     any  Prospective  Employees  identified  by Buyer,  in order to  attempt to
     minimize Buyer's liability under the first sentence of this subsection. All
     employees  involuntarily  separated  from  employment by any of the Selling
     Companies within 90 days of the Closing Date, the involuntary separation of
     whom could result in a notice requirement covered by this Section, shall be
     identified  on a schedule  to be  prepared  by the  Selling  Companies  and
     submitted  to Buyer on the Closing  Date.  Buyer and the Selling  Companies
     shall cooperate with each other to provide timely notice,  if required,  to
     any  Governmental  Entity of the  consummation  of this  Agreement  and the
     related  transfer of  employees.  The Selling  Companies  shall  retain the
     obligations with respect to COBRA continuation coverage for all Prospective
     Employees who are not Transferred Employees.

     the Purchase are subject to the fulfillment or written waiver,  at or prior
     to the Closing Date, of each of the following conditions:

          (a) Regulatory   Approvals.   All  Governmental   Authority  approvals
     required to consummate the transactions  contemplated hereby will have been
     obtained and will remain in full force and effect and all statutory waiting
     periods in respect thereof will have expired,  unless the failure to obtain
     any such  approval  is not  reasonably  likely to have a  Material  Adverse
     Effect on the Business.

          (b) No Injunction. No Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction
     will have enacted,  issued,  promulgated,  enforced or entered any statute,
     rule,  regulation,  judgment,  decree,  injunction or other order  (whether
     temporary,  preliminary  or  permanent)  which is in effect  and  prohibits
     consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a whole.

          (c)  Certain  Representations.  The  representation  and  warranty  of
     Sellers set forth in Section 4.03(v)(3) shall be true and correct as of the
     Closing Date.

     to the fulfillment or written  waiver,  at or prior to the Closing Date, of

          (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties
     of Sellers set forth in this  Agreement  will be true and correct as of the

     of the Closing Date (except that  representations  and  warranties  that by
     their terms speak as of the date of this  Agreement or some other date will
     be true and  correct  as of such date  only) and Buyer  will have  received
     certificates,  dated the Closing Date,  signed on behalf of each of Sellers
     to such effect;  provided,  however,  that for purposes of determining  the
     satisfaction of this  condition,  no effect shall be given to any exception
     or  qualification  in  such  representations  and  warranties  relating  to
     materiality or a Material  Adverse Effect;  and provided  further that, for
     purposes of this condition, such representations and warranties (other than
     the representations and warranties in Section 4.02(b),  which shall be true
     in all  respects)  shall be deemed to be true and  correct in all  respects
     unless the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and
     correct,  individually or in the aggregate,  results or would reasonably be
     expected  to result in a  Material  Adverse  Effect  on  Sellers  or on the
     Business.

          (b) Performance of Obligations of Sellers. Sellers will have performed
     in all material  respects all obligations  required to be performed by them

     execution,   delivery  and   performance  of  this   Agreement   (including

     7.02(c) and all consents and approvals with respect to agreements listed on
     Exhibit 7.02(c) must be obtained and in full force and effect.

     of Buyer set forth in this  Agreement  will be true and  correct  as of the

                                       60

     be true and correct as of such date only) and Sellers will have  received a
     certificate,  dated  the  Closing  Date,  signed on behalf of Buyer to such
     effect;   provided,   however,   that  for  purposes  of  determining   the
     satisfaction of this  condition,  no effect shall be given to any exception
     or  qualification  in  such  representations  and  warranties  relating  to
     materiality or a Material  Adverse Effect;  and provided  further that, for
     purposes of this condition, such representations and warranties (other than
     the representations and warranties in Section 4.03(b),  which shall be true
     in all  respects)  shall be deemed to be true and  correct in all  respects
     unless the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and
     correct,  individually or in the aggregate,  results or would reasonably be
     expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer.

          (b) Performance of Obligations of Buyer.  Buyer will have performed in
     all material respects all obligations  required to be performed by it under
     this  Agreement  at or prior to the  Closing  Date and  Sellers  will  have

     execution,   delivery  and   performance  of  this   Agreement   (including
     consummation  of the Purchase)  will have been obtained and will be in full

     contained herein,  which breach cannot be cured or which has not been cured
     within 30 days after the giving of written notice to the breaching party of
     such breach,  or (2) a breach by the other party of any of the covenants or
     agreements  contained herein, which breach cannot be cured or which has not
     been  cured  within 30 days  after  the  giving  of  written  notice to the
     breaching  party of such breach,  provided that such breach  (whether under
     (1) or (2)) would be reasonably  likely,  individually  or in the aggregate
     with other breaches, to result in a Material Adverse Effect.


                                       61

          (c) Delay. By Sellers or Buyer,  by written notice,  in the event that
     the  Purchase  is not  consummated  by the first day of the month after the
     month in which the  six-month  anniversary  of execution of this  Agreement
     occurs,  except to the extent that the failure of the  Purchase  then to be
     consummated  arises out of or results  from the action or  inaction  of the
     party seeking to terminate pursuant to this Section 8.01(c).

          (d) No Approval.  By Sellers or Buyer, by written notice, in the event
     the approval of any Governmental Authority required for consummation of the

     Authority  will have  issued an order,  decree or ruling or taken any other
     action  in  effect   permanently   restraining,   enjoining   or  otherwise
     prohibiting   consummation  of  the   transactions   contemplated  by  this
     Agreement,  and such order, decree, ruling or other action will have become
     final and nonappealable,  unless the failure to obtain any such approval is
     not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business.

          8.02 Effect of Termination and Abandonment.

          In the event of termination  of this Agreement and the  abandonment of
     the Purchase pursuant to this Article VIII, no party to this Agreement will
     have  any  liability  or  further  obligation  to any  other  party to this
     Agreement,  except (a) for  obligations  arising  under  Sections  5.02(b),
     5.02(c),  5.04 and  5.11(b),  this Section 8.02 and Article XI and (b) that
     termination  will not  relieve a  breaching  party from  liability  for any
     willful breach of this Agreement giving rise to such termination.

     indemnification  obligations of Sellers and Buyer under this Section 10.02,
     from and after the Closing Date:

          (a) Sellers shall  jointly and  severally  indemnify and hold harmless

              (i)  any breach of any representation,  warranty or agreement made
                   by, or on behalf of, Sellers under this Agreement  other than
                   those specifically referred to in Section 10.01(a)(i); or

     breach of any  representation,  warranty or agreement made by, or on behalf
     of, Buyer under this Agreement other than those specifically referred to in
     Section 10.01(b)(i).

          10.03 Survival Periods.

          The  obligations  to indemnify and hold harmless any party pursuant to
     Section  10.02(a)  or  10.02(b)  shall  terminate  on June  30,  2003.  The
     obligations  to indemnify and hold  harmless any party  pursuant to Section
     10.01(a) and 10.01(b) shall survive indefinitely.

          10.04 Miscellaneous.

          (a) After the Closing,  and except for any claims made under  Sections
     5.02(b),  (c), (d), (e), 5.04, 5.05, 5.06, 5.07, 5.08, 5.10, 5.11, 5.12 and
     5.13 and  Article IX, and the  Ancillary  Agreements,  the  indemnification
     expressly provided in this Article X shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
     for  any  matter  arising  out of or  relating  to  this  Agreement  or the
     transactions  contemplated  hereby  by  any  party.  Nothing  herein  shall
     preclude a party hereto from  applying to a court for  equitable  relief to
     enforce its rights under this Agreement.

          (b) Each  indemnitee  under  this  Article X shall use its  reasonable
     efforts  to  mitigate   Liabilities   for  which  it  seeks  or  reasonably
     anticipates seeking indemnification hereunder.


                                       65
<PAGE>


          (c) For purposes of determining  whether a breach of a  representation
     or warranty in this  Agreement  has occurred for purposes of this Article X
     no effect  shall be given to any  exception  or  qualification  relating to
     materiality or Material Adverse Effect.

          (d) In  calculating  any amount of  Liabilities  payable to Sellers or
     Buyer under this Article X, the indemnifying party shall receive credit for
     (1) any  reduction in tax  liability of the  Indemnified  Party (as defined
     herein)  as  a  result  of  the  facts   giving   rise  to  the  claim  for
     indemnification, (2) any insurance recoveries offsetting the amount of loss
     and (3) any recoveries from third parties  pursuant to  indemnification  or
     otherwise with respect thereto.  Any party receiving indemnity shall assign
     to the  indemnifying  party all of its claims for  recovery  against  third
     parties as to such Liabilities whether by insurance coverage,  contribution
     claims, subrogation or otherwise.

          10.05 De Minimis Liability, Deductible and Cap.

          (a) Sellers  shall not have any  Liability  whatsoever  under  Section
     10.02(a) for any  individual  Liability  that is less than $25,000 (the "De
     Minimis  Liability  Restriction").  Sellers  shall  not have any  liability
     whatsoever  under Section 10.02(a) for any Liability until the aggregate of
     all  Liabilities  for which Sellers would be liable under Section  10.02(a)
     exceeds  on  a  cumulative   basis  an  amount  equal  to  $3,500,000  (the
     "Deductible"),  and then only to the extent of any such excess. The maximum
     liability of Sellers  (collectively)  under Section 10.02(a) shall be equal
     to $125,000,000 (the "Cap").

          (b)  Buyer  shall  not have any  Liability  whatsoever  under  Section
     10.02(b) for any  individual  Liability  that is less than  $25,000.  Buyer
     shall not have any  liability  whatsoever  under  Section  10.02(b) for any
     Liability  until the aggregate of all  Liabilities for which Buyer would be
     liable under Section 10.02(b) exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal
     to the  Deductible,  and then only to the  extent of any such  excess.  The
     maximum  liability of Buyer under  Section  10.02(b)  shall be equal to the
     Cap.

          10.06 Third-Party Claims.

          If a claim by a third party (a "Third-Party  Claim") is made against a
     Seller  Indemnified  Party or Buyer  Indemnified  Party  (collectively,  an
     "Indemnified  Party"),  and if  such  Indemnified  Party  intends  to  seek
     indemnity with respect thereto under this Article X, such Indemnified Party
     shall  promptly  notify in writing the  indemnifying  party of such claims;
     provided, that, that failure to promptly notify the indemnifying party will
     not  relieve the  indemnifying  party of any  liability  it may have to the
     indemnified  party,  except  to the  extent  that  the  indemnifying  party
     demonstrates  that the defense of such  Third-Party  Claim is prejudiced by
     the indemnified party's failure to give notice within such time period. The
     indemnifying  party  shall  have 30 days after  receipt  of such  notice to
     undertake,  conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing and at
     its own expense,  the settlement or defense  thereof,  and the  Indemnified
     Party shall  cooperate with it in connection  therewith;  provided that the
     indemnifying  party shall permit the  Indemnified  Party to  participate in
     such  settlement  or defense  through  counsel  chosen by such  Indemnified
     Party,  provided  that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne


                                       66
<PAGE>

     by such Indemnified  Party. If the indemnifying  party so chooses to assume
     the  defense  it  shall  do so  promptly  and  diligently.  So  long as the
     indemnifying  party is reasonably  contesting any such claim in good faith,
     the   Indemnified   Party   shall  not  pay  or  settle  any  such   claim.
     Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the Indemnified Party shall have the right
     to pay or settle any such claim,  provided  that,  in such event,  it shall
     waive any right to indemnity  therefor by the  indemnifying  party.  If the
     indemnifying  party does not notify the Indemnified Party in writing within
     30 days after the receipt of the  Indemnified  Party's  written notice of a
     claim of  indemnity  hereunder  that it elects  to  undertake  the  defense
     thereof,  the Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest,  settle or
     compromise  the claim but shall not  thereby  waive any right to  indemnity
     therefor  pursuant to this  Agreement.  The  indemnifying  party shall not,
     except with the written  consent of the Indemnified  Party,  enter into any
     settlement  unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of
     Applicable Law, (B) the sole relief  provided is monetary  damages that are
     paid in full by the indemnifying  party,  (C) the indemnified  party or its
     Affiliates  shall  have no  liability  with  respect to any  compromise  or
     settlement of such Third-Party  Claim, and (D) the compromise or settlement
     provides  to all  indemnified  parties and their  Affiliates  and agents an
     unconditional  release from all liability with respect to such  Third-Party
     Claim or the facts underlying such Third-Party  Claim.  With respect to any
     Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under this Article X, (i) both
     the Indemnified Party and the indemnifying party, as the case may be, shall
     keep the other party reasonably  informed of the status of such Third-Party
     Claim and any related  proceedings at all stages thereof,  (ii) the parties
     agree to  render  to each  other  such  assistance  as they may  reasonably
     require  of each  other and to  cooperate  in good faith with each other in
     order to ensure the proper and adequate  defense of any  Third-Party  Claim
     and (iii) with respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to  indemnification

          11.08 Waiver of Jury Trial.

          Each party hereto  acknowledges and agrees that any controversy  which
     may  arise  under  this  Agreement  is likely to  involve  complicated  and
     difficult  issues,  and therefore  each such party hereby  irrevocably  and
     unconditionally  waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in
     respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of or relating
     to this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each
     party  certifies  and  acknowledges  that (a) no  representative,  agent or
     attorney of any other party has represented,  expressly or otherwise,  that
     such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the
     foregoing  waiver,  (b)  each  party  understands  and has  considered  the
     implications of this waiver, (c) each party makes this waiver  voluntarily,
     and (d) each party has been induced to enter into this  Agreement by, among
     other things,  the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 11.08.

          11.09 Counterparts.

          This  Agreement may be executed in two or more  counterparts,  each of
     which  shall  be  deemed  an  original,  and all of  which  together  shall
     constitute one and the same instrument.

          11.10 Severability.

          The  provisions  of this  Agreement  will be deemed  severable and the
     invalidity  or  unenforceability  of any  provision  will  not  affect  the
     validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision
     of this Agreement,  or the  application  thereof to any person or entity or
     any circumstance,  is found by a court or other  Governmental  Authority of
     competent  jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable,  (a) a suitable and
     equitable provision will be substituted  therefor in order to carry out, so
     far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid
     or unenforceable  provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
     application of such provision to other persons,  entities or  circumstances
     will not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,  nor will such
     invalidity or  unenforceability  affect the validity or  enforceability  of
     such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

          11.11 Affiliates of Buyer.

          To the extent that this  Agreement  obligates  any  Affiliate of Buyer
     either to take or to refrain from taking certain actions, Buyer shall cause
     such Affiliate to comply with such covenant.
