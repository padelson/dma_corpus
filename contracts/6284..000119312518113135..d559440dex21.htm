WHEREAS, the parties intend that the Merger Sub, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the MBCA,
merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving
corporation of such merger (the " _Merger_ ") and each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares) being converted in the Merger into the
right to receive $84.00 per share, without interest thereon and subject to

WHEREAS, the Company Board has as of the date hereof unanimously (i)
determined that this Agreement and the Merger are in the best interests of
the Company; (ii) adopted this Agreement; (iii) approved the Merger; (iv)
directed that this Agreement be submitted to the Companys shareholders for
approval; and (v) resolved to recommend approval of this Agreement by the
Companys shareholders;

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Parent and the Merger Sub
have adopted, approved and declared it advisable for the Parent and the
Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein; and

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement,
each of the parties identified as a "Guarantor" in the Guarantee (each, a "
_Guarantor_ ") is entering into the Guarantee with respect to certain
obligations of the Parent and the Merger Sub under this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
Parent, the Merger Sub and the Company, intending to be legally bound, hereby
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the MBCA, the Merger Sub shall merge
with and into the Company at the Effective Time. 1.2 _Effective Time of the Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing
Date, the Parent, the Merger Sub and the Company shall cause articles of
merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the " _Articles of
Merger_ ") to be duly prepared, executed and acknowledged in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the MBCA and filed with the Secretary of State. The
Merger shall become effective upon the due filing of the Articles of Merger
with the Secretary of State or at such subsequent time or date as the Parent
and the Company shall agree and specify in the Articles of Merger (the "
_Effective Time_ ").

 

1.3 _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
by law) of the conditions set forth in Article VII, the Closing shall take
place at the offices of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State
Street, Boston, MA 02109 as soon as practicable (but in any event no later
than the second Business Day) following the day on which the last to
be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of such conditions) shall be satisfied or
waived in accordance with this Agreement; _provided_ , that if the Interim
Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of such conditions), then, subject to the continued satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII at such time, the Closing
shall occur instead on the earliest of (a) any Business Day during the
Interim Period as may be specified by the Parent on not less than three
Business Days prior written notice to the Company (it being understood that
such date may be conditioned upon the simultaneous completion of the Debt
Financing), (b) the first Business Day immediately following the final
Business Day of the Interim Period or (c) such other time, date or place as is
agreed to in writing by the Parent and the Company.

 

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time (a) the separate existence
of the Merger Sub shall cease, the Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company and the Company shall continue as the Surviving Corporation in the
Merger and (b) the articles of organization of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in its
entirety to read as set forth on _Exhibit A_ , until further amended in
accordance with the MBCA, subject to Section 6.7(b). In addition, subject to
Section 6.7(b), the Parent shall cause the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
to be amended and restated in their entirety so that, immediately following
the Effective Time, they are identical to the bylaws of the Merger Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that all references to
the name of the Merger Sub therein shall be changed to refer to the name of
the Company, and, as so amended and restated, such bylaws shall be the bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation, until further amended in accordance with the
MBCA. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 11.07 of the
MBCA and in this Agreement.

1.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of
the Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case to hold office in accordance with the
articles of organization and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and until
their successors are duly elected and qualified.

 



2 ARTICLE II

 

TREATMENT OF COMPANY SECURITIES

 

2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, the Merger Sub, the
Parent or the holder of any shares of the capital stock of the Company or
capital stock of the Merger Sub:

(a)  _Capital Stock of the Merger Sub_. Each share of the common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned Stock_. Any shares of Company Common Stock
owned by any Subsidiary of the Company, the Parent, the Merger Sub or any
other Subsidiary of the Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.

(c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.2
each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration. As of the Effective Time, all
such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this Section 2.1(c) in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2.

 

(d) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. Subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 5.1(a) and Section 5.1(b) below, the Merger Consideration
shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock
split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution
of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company
Common Stock occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

 

2.2 _Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall engage the
Paying Agent pursuant to an agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall deposit with the
Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, for payment through
the Paying Agent in accordance with this Section 2.2, the Payment Fund (it
being understood and agreed that Parent may elect to use the available
unrestricted cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries to fund a portion of the
Payment Fund at the Closing). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by the Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall
be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in
commercial paper obligations

 



3  rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank which are then publicly available); _provided_ , _however_ , that
no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable hereunder and the
Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, from and after the
Effective Time, the Payment Fund includes at all times cash sufficient to
satisfy the Parents obligation to pay the Merger Consideration under this
Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments (net
of any losses) shall be paid to the Parent pursuant to Section 2.2(e). In the
event the Payment Fund is diminished below the level required for the Paying
Agent to make prompt cash payments as required under Section 2.2(b), including
any such diminishment as a result of investment losses, the Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, immediately deposit additional cash
into the Payment Fund in an amount equal to the deficiency in the amount
required to make such payments.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) Promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) after the
Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate (A) a letter of transmittal in customary
form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(g)) to the
Paying Agent, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
2.2(g)) in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto.
Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 2.2(g)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms
of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate
shall be promptly paid in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately
available funds equal to (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 2.2(g)) multiplied by (2) the Merger
Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of
Uncertificated Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article
II. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Uncertificated
Shares shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in
customary form with respect to any Uncertificated Share (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) be
promptly paid the Merger Consideration pursuant to, and in accordance with,
the terms of this Agreement in respect of such Uncertificated Share, and such
Uncertificated Share shall forthwith be cancelled.

 

(c) _Interest; Transfers; Rights Following the Effective Time_. No interest
will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of such
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration
is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that
(i) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in

 



4  proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not
required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect
to Uncertificated Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such
Uncertificated Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.2, each Certificate and all Uncertificated Shares (other than
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing Dissenting Shares) shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by
Section 2.1(c), without any interest thereon.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates and cancellation of
Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been paid in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates
and Uncertificated Shares, and from and after the Effective Time there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II, subject to Section 2.2(e).

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares for one year after the Effective Time (including all interest and other
income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to
it) shall be delivered to the Parent, upon demand, and any holder of a
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares who has not previously complied with this
Section 2.2 shall be entitled to receive only from the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws)
payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, without interest.

(f) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the
Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any
amount required to be delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if reasonably required
by the Parent with respect to Merger Consideration in excess of $35,000, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as
the Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to
be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
thereby pursuant to this Agreement.

 



5 2.3 _Company Stock Plans_.

 

(a) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-
outstanding and unexercised Company Stock Option shall vest in full
and automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive from
the Surviving Corporation an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock then underlying such Company
Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option.
In the event that the exercise price of any Company Stock Option is equal to
or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be
cancelled, without any consideration being payable in respect thereof, and
have no further force or effect.

 

(b) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company RSU
that is then outstanding and unvested shall vest in full and automatically be
canceled and converted into the right to receive from the Company an amount of
cash from the Company equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares
of Company Common Stock then underlying such Company RSU multiplied by (ii)
the Merger Consideration.

(c) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company PSU
that is then outstanding and unvested shall vest with respect to the number
of shares of Company Common Stock that would have been earned under such
Company PSU based on the methodology set forth in the applicable Company PSU
award agreement (as in effect on the date hereof) and in Section 2.3 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Number of Vested PSUs_ ") and shall
automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive from the
Company an amount of cash from the Company equal to the product of (i) the
Number of Vested PSUs multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration.

(d) The Parent shall (i) cause the Company and the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, to make the payments (without interest) contemplated by the
foregoing Section 2.3(a), Section 2.3(b) and Section 2.3(c) as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the
Effective Time, and (ii) cause the Company and the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, to maintain at all times from and after the Effective Time
sufficient liquid funds to satisfy its obligations pursuant to Section
2.3(a), Section 2.3(b) and Section 2.3(c).

(e) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall mail to each Person who is a holder of Company Stock Options,
Company RSUs or Company PSUs a letter describing the treatment of and payment
for such equity awards pursuant to this Section 2.3 and providing
instructions for use in obtaining payment therefor. The Company shall provide
the Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review the notices described in
this Section 2.3(e) in advance of providing said notices and the Company
shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments provided by the Parent
to the Company.

(f) If the Effective Time occurs on or before the last business day of a
Payment Period (as such term is defined in the Company ESPP) in effect as of
the date of this Agreement and there are options then outstanding with respect
to such Payment Period, the Company Board shall, prior to the Effective Time,
take such actions as are necessary to provide that all outstanding options
shall be cancelled as of the Closing Date, provided that notice of such
cancellation shall be given to each holder of an option, and each holder of an
option shall

 



6  have the right to exercise such option in full on the Closing Date (or, if
not practicable, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date)
based on payroll deductions then credited to his or her account as of a date
determined by the Company Board, which date shall not be less than ten (10)
days preceding the Closing Date. If the Effective Time occurs after the last
business day of a Payment Period in effect as of the date of this Agreement
(i.e., a new Payment Period has commenced), the Company Board shall terminate
the Company ESPP as of a date prior to the Closing Date and, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following such termination, all payroll deductions
pursuant to the Company ESPP shall be paid out to the participating employees
under the Company ESPP. In any event, the Company Board shall terminate the
Company ESPP prior to the Effective Time.

 

(g) The Parent and the Company may agree to treat equity compensation held by
Company employees subject to non-U.S. law in a manner other than that
contemplated above in this Section 2.3 to the extent necessary to take into
account applicable non-U.S. law or Tax or employment considerations.

 

2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary,
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to, and who has
perfected, appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with Part 13 of the
MBCA (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), if such Part 13 of the MBCA is
determined to be applicable, shall not be converted into or represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1 but
shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the MBCA to a holder
of Dissenting Shares.

 

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect, withdrawal or otherwise), or if a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Part 13 of the MBCA, then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the date
of loss of such status, such shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1, without interest, and shall not
thereafter be deemed to be Dissenting Shares.

 

(c) The Company shall give the Parent: (i) prompt notice of any written demand
for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to

lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and, where

standing, individually or in the aggregate, that are not reasonably likely to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The Parent has delivered or made
available to the Company complete and correct copies of the certificate of

the Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by the Parent and the Merger Sub

of organization, bylaws or other organizational documents of the Parent or
the Merger Sub, (ii) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of,
or constitute a default with or without notice or the lapse of time, or both

waiver under, or result (or, with or without notice or lapse of time, or both,
would result) in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset,
property or right of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any lease, license, contract or other
agreement, instrument or obligation to which the Parent or the Merger Sub is
a party or by which any of them or any of their properties or assets may be
bound, or (iii) subject to compliance with the requirements specified in
clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of Section 4.2(c), conflict with or

order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to the
Parent or the Merger Sub or any of its or their respective properties, rights

4.2(b) for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,

 



27  defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations, losses, penalties or
Liens, and for any consents or waivers not obtained, that, individually or in
the aggregate, have not had and would not be reasonably likely to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

or registration, declaration, notice or filing with, any Governmental Entity
or any stock market or stock exchange on which shares of common stock of the
Parent are listed for trading is required by or with respect to the Parent or
the Merger Sub in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Parent or the Merger Sub or the consummation by the Parent or
the Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for
(i) the pre-merger notification requirements under the HSR Act and any other
applicable Antitrust Laws, (ii) the filing of the Articles of Merger with the
Secretary of State and appropriate corresponding documents with the
appropriate authorities of other states in which the Company is qualified as a

or materials under the Exchange Act as may be required in connection with

made, individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(d) No vote of the holders of any class or series of the Parents capital
stock or other securities is necessary for the consummation by the Parent of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

4.3 _Information Provided_. The information to be supplied by or on behalf of
the Parent or the Merger Sub for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, on the
date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to shareholders of the Company, at
the time of any amendment or supplement thereto and at the time of the Company
Shareholder Approval, in each case shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they shall
be made, not misleading.

 

4.4 _Operations of the Merger Sub_. The Merger Sub was formed solely for the
purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
has engaged in no other business activities other than in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and in connection with the Financing.

 

4.5 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies,
including all exhibits and schedules thereto, of (a) the executed commitment
letter, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Equity Funding Letter_ "), from
the Guarantors, pursuant to which the Guarantors have agreed to make equity
investments in the Parent, subject to the terms and conditions therein, in
cash in the aggregate amount set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ "),
and (b) the executed commitment letter and Redacted Fee Letter, dated as of
the date hereof (collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " and, together
with the Equity Funding Letter, the " _Financing Letters_ "), from MidCap
Financial Trust, pursuant to which MidCap Financial Trust has agreed to
provide, subject to the terms and conditions therein, debt financing in the
amounts

 



28  set forth therein (being collectively referred to as the " _Debt Financing_
" and, together with the Equity Financing, collectively referred to as the "
_Financing_ ") for purposes of financing the Transactions and the related
fees and expenses to be incurred by Parent in connection therewith. As of the
date of this Agreement, neither of the Financing Letters has been amended or
modified, no such amendment or modification is contemplated, none of the
respective obligations and commitments contained in such letters have been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect and no such withdrawal,
termination or rescission is contemplated. The Parent or the Merger Sub has
fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the
Financing Letters that are payable on or prior to the date hereof and (unless
payment is agreed to be deferred or waived by the Debt Financing Sources in a
binding written instrument) will continue to pay in full any such amounts
required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Financing Letters as and when
they become due and payable on or prior to the Closing Date. Assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions in Article VII, and assuming the Financing is
funded in accordance with the Financing Letters and the completion of the
Interim Period, the net proceeds contemplated by the Financing Letters (after
netting out applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar
premiums and charges and after giving effect to the maximum amount of flex
(including original issue discount flex) provided under the Debt Commitment
Letter), together with the available unrestricted cash of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, will in the aggregate be sufficient for the Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (and any
repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by, or required in connection
with the transactions described in, this Agreement, the Equity Funding Letter
or the Debt Commitment Letter) and any other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions (including all amounts
payable in respect of Company Stock Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs
under this Agreement) and to pay all related fees and expenses of the Parent
and the Merger Sub. The Financing Letters are (x) legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Parent and the Merger Sub, as applicable, and each of the
other parties thereto, (y) enforceable in accordance with their respective
terms against the Parent and the Merger Sub, as applicable, and each of the
other parties thereto, in each case except as such enforceability may be
limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, and (z) in full force and
effect. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected
to constitute a default or breach on the part of the Parent or the Merger Sub
or, to the knowledge of the Parent, any other parties thereto under the Equity
Funding Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this
Agreement, the Parent does not have any reason to believe that it or any of
the other parties to the Financing Letters will be unable to satisfy on a
timely basis any term or condition of the Financing Letters required to be
satisfied by it, that the conditions thereof will not otherwise be satisfied
or that the full amount of the Financing will not be available on the Closing
Date. The only conditions precedent or other contingencies (including market
"flex" provisions) related to the obligations of the Guarantors to fund the
full amount of the Equity Financing and the lenders to fund the full amount of
the Debt Financing are those expressly set forth in the Equity Funding Letter
and the Debt Commitment Letter, respectively. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no side letters or other contracts or arrangements to
which the Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party related to the Financing
other than as expressly contained in the Financing Letters and delivered
to the Company prior to the date hereof.

4.6 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Parent
has delivered to the Company the duly executed limited guarantee of the
Guarantors, dated as of the

 



29  date of this Agreement, in favor of the Company in respect of the Parents
obligation to pay the Parent Termination Fee and the Parents and the Merger
Subs other payment or reimbursement obligations arising under, or in
connection with, this Agreement and the Transactions, up to the aggregate
amount set forth therein (the " _Guarantee_ "). The Guarantee is in full force
and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantors,
enforceable against the Guarantors in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

 

4.7 _Solvency_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantors is entering into
this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either
present or future creditors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Assuming (a) satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Parents and the
Merger Subs obligation to consummate the Merger and the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III, (b)
the effectiveness of the Transactions and the payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration, any other repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in
this Agreement or the Financing Letters, payment of all amounts required to
be paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, and payment
of all related fees and expenses of the Parent and the Merger Sub, and (c) the
Company and its Subsidiaries will be Solvent immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent
as of the Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the
Transactions. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ ",
when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of
determination, (i) the then present fair salable value of the assets of such
Person and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, at a fair valuation,
will exceed, as of that date, the debts and liabilities, direct, subordinated,
contingent or otherwise, of such Person and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis, (ii) the present fair saleable value of the property of such Person
and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will be greater than the amount
that will be required to pay the probable liability of such Person and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis on their debts and other liabilities,
direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and other
liabilities become absolute and matured, (iii) such Person and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will not have unreasonably small capital
with which to conduct the businesses in which they are engaged as such
businesses are now conducted and are proposed to be conducted within 90 days
following the Closing Date and (iv) such Person and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis will be able to pay their debts and liabilities, direct,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and liabilities become
absolute and matured.

 

4.8 _Ownership of Company Common Stock._ None of the Merger Sub or the Parent
or any of their "Affiliates" or "Associates" (as those terms are defined in
Section 110F of the Massachusetts General Laws) (a) directly or indirectly
"owns" or, within the past three (3) years, has "owned," beneficially or
otherwise, any shares of Company Common Stock, any other securities of the
Company or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire shares of Company
Common Stock or other securities of the Company, or any other economic

has been an "Affiliate" or "Associate" (as those terms are defined in Section
110F of the Massachusetts General Laws) of the Company at any time during the

proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation pending and of which Parent
has been notified or, to the

 



30  Parents knowledge, threatened against the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
is reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the date
of this Agreement, there are no judgments, orders or decrees outstanding
against the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

Company all contracts, arrangements or understandings (and, with respect to
those that are written, the Parent has furnished to the Company correct and
complete copies thereof) between or among the Parent, the Merger Sub, or any
Affiliate of the Parent, on the one hand, and any member of the board of
directors or management of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

4.11 _Brokers_. No agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other firm or Person is or shall be entitled, as a result of any action or
agreement of the Parent or any of its Affiliates, to any brokers, finders,
financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries would have any obligations or liabilities prior to the
Effective Time.

 

4.12 _Independent Investigation_. Each of the Parent and the Merger Sub
acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction its own independent
investigation and analysis of the business, operations, assets, liabilities,
results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise) and prospects of the
Company and the Companys Subsidiaries and that each of the Parent and
the Merger Sub and its Representatives have received access to such books and
records, facilities, equipment, contracts and other assets of the Company and
the Companys Subsidiaries that it and its Representatives have desired or
requested to review for such purpose, and that it and its Representatives
have had a full opportunity to meet with the management of the Company and the

Merger Sub hereby acknowledge and agree that, (a) except for the

any of its or

 



31  their respective Affiliates, shareholders or Representatives, or any other

ARTICLE VI

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

6.1 _No Solicitation_.

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Except as set forth in this Section 6.1,
until the Effective Time, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall, and the Company shall cause its directors, officers and senior
management not to and shall use reasonable efforts to cause its other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

 

(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; or

(ii) other than informing Persons of the existence of the provisions of this
Section 6.1, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, or provide or furnish to
any Person or group who has made or would reasonably be expected to make any
Acquisition Proposal or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating any
Acquisition Proposal any non-public information concerning the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, subject to compliance with Section 6.1(c), if at any time prior
to the Effective Time, (i) the Company has received after the date of this
Agreement a written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material
breach of this Section 6.1, and (ii) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after

 



37  consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in
a Superior Proposal (the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, a "
_Qualified Person_ "), then the Company may (A) furnish non-public information
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Qualified Person (and
the Representatives of such Qualified Person), pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement not materially less restrictive with respect to the confidentiality
and non-use obligations of the Qualified Person than the Confidentiality
Agreement ( _provided_ , that the Company shall promptly thereafter (and in
any event within one (1) Business Day) provide to the Parent, subject to the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, any material non-public information
(whether written or unwritten) concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries
that is provided to (or made accessible to) such Qualified Person and which
was not previously provided or made available to the Parent), (B) engage in
discussions or negotiations (including solicitation of revised
Acquisition Proposals) with any such Qualified Person (and the
Representatives of such Qualified Person) regarding any such Acquisition
Proposal and (C) amend, or grant a waiver or release under, any standstill or
similar agreement with respect to any Company Common Stock with any such
Qualified Person.

(b) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_.
Prior to the Effective Time:

(i) the Company Board shall not, except as set forth in this Section 6.1, (x)
fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (y)
withhold, withdraw or modify or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw or
modify, in a manner adverse to the Parent or the Merger Sub, the Company Board
Recommendation or (z) adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly
propose to adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any
action described in clauses (x), (y) or (z), a " _Company Board Recommendation
Change_ "); and

 

(ii) the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") providing for a transaction
contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.1(a) entered into in the
circumstances referred to in Section 6.1(a)).

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement (including the provisions of this Section 6.1), at any time prior to
the Effective Time, the Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal or (B) effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change (other than pursuant to clause (z) of the
definition thereof) in response to an Intervening Event if (in the case of
either clause (A) or (B)): (i) the Company Board shall have determined in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; (ii) the Company
has notified the Parent in writing at least four (4) Business Days prior to
taking such action that it intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change, describing in reasonable detail the reasons for such Company Board
Recommendation Change (a " _Recommendation Change Notice_ ") (it being
understood that the Recommendation Change

 



38  Notice shall not, in and of itself, constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change or a Trigger Event for purposes of this Agreement so
long as such notice states that it is not a Company Board Recommendation
Change and that the Company Board is not changing the Company Board
Recommendation); (iii) if requested by the Parent, the Company shall have made
available and instructed its Representatives to discuss and negotiate with
the Parents Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement (in a manner that would obviate the need to
effect such Company Board Recommendation Change) during the four (4) Business
Day period following delivery by the Company to the Parent of such
Recommendation Change Notice; and (iv) if the Parent shall have delivered to
the Company a written, binding and irrevocable offer to alter the terms or
conditions of this Agreement during such four (4) Business Day period
(provided that the Parent may revise its offer in response to any revisions to
a Superior Proposal and the Parents binding offer may terminate after the
expiration of such four (4) Business Day period), the Company Board shall
have determined in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel), after
giving effect to the terms of any revised offer by the Parent, that the
failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would still be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law and, with respect to a Company Board Recommendation Change in
response to a Superior Proposal, the Company Board has determined in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel)
that such initial or revised (as applicable) Superior Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal; _provided_ that, if there are any material
amendments, revisions or changes to the terms of any such Superior Proposal
(including any revision to the amount, form or mix of consideration the
Companys shareholders would receive as a result of the Superior Proposal,
whether or not material), the Company shall notify the Parent of each such
amendment, revision or change in compliance with Section 6.1(c) and the
applicable four (4) Business Day period described above shall be extended
until at least two (2) Business Days after the time that the Parent receives
notification from the Company of each such amendment, revision or change and
the Company Board shall not make a Company Board Recommendation Change prior
to the end of any such period as so extended and compliance with the
other requirements described above during such period as so extended.

(c) _Notices to the Parent_. The Company shall promptly (and in any event
within one (1) Business Day) advise the Parent in writing of the Companys
receipt of any written Acquisition Proposal, including the material terms and
conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the
Person making any such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and,
in any event, within one (1) Business Day) provide the Parent with copies of
all material written requests, proposals or offers, including any proposed
agreements (whether or not material) and any material changes to the terms of
the Acquisition Proposal (whether written or oral), received by or made to the
Company from any Person or group making an Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall not enter into any confidentiality agreement subsequent to the date
hereof which prohibits the Company from providing to the Parent the
information required to be provided to the Parent pursuant to this Section
6.1(c).

 

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Company Board from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Companys shareholders a position with respect to a tender
offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending

 



39  disclosure of its position thereunder (none of which, in and of itself,
shall be deemed to constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change), or (ii)
making any disclosure to the Companys shareholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel,
failure to so disclose would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law;  _provided_ that this Section 6.1(d)
shall not permit the Company Board of Directors to make a Company Board
Recommendation Change except to the extent expressly permitted by, and in
accordance with, Section 6.1(b) or Section 8.1(f).

(e) _Cessation of Ongoing Discussions_. The Company shall, and shall cause its
and its Subsidiaries directors, officers and senior management, and shall
direct and cause its other Representatives to, except with respect to the
Parent and the Merger Sub, (i) cease immediately all discussions and
negotiations that commenced prior to the date of this Agreement regarding any
proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential or non-public information previously furnished to any Person
within the last twelve (12) months for the purpose of evaluating a possible
Acquisition Proposal and (iii) terminate access to any physical or electronic
data rooms relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not in any way limit or modify any of the
Companys rights under the other provisions of this Section 6.1.

 

6.2 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Company Shareholder Approval of the
Merger_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall (i) prepare (with the Parents reasonable cooperation) and
file with the SEC a proxy statement (as amended or supplemented from time to
time, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") to be sent to the shareholders of the Company
relating to the meeting of the Companys shareholders (the " _Company
Meeting_ ") to be held to consider, among other matters, the approval of this
Agreement and (ii) set a record date for determining the shareholders entitled
to notice of and to vote at the Company Meeting and commence a broker search
pursuant to Section 14a-13 of the Exchange Act in connection therewith. No
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by
the Company without providing the Parent a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment thereon and the Company will consider in good faith incorporating
any reasonable comments timely made thereto by the Parent. The Company will
advise the Parent promptly after it receives any oral or written request by
the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information, and will promptly
provide the Parent with copies of any written communication from the SEC or
any state securities commission and a reasonable opportunity to participate
in the responses thereto and the Company will consider in good faith
incorporating any reasonable comments to such response timely made by the
Parent. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating
to the Company or the Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers
or directors, should be discovered by the Company or the Parent that should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the
Proxy Statement would not contain any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
promptly be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required under applicable
law, disseminated to

 



40  shareholders of the Company; _provided_ that the delivery of such notice and
the filing of any such amendment or supplement shall not affect or be deemed
to modify any representation or warranty made by any party hereunder or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any party.

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Companys receipt of
notice from the SEC that the SEC has completed its review of the Proxy
Statement (or, if the SEC does not inform the Company that it intends to
review the Proxy Statement on or before the 10th calendar day following the
filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement pursuant to Rule 14a-6 under the
Exchange Act, as promptly as reasonably practicable following such 10th
calendar day), the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Company Meeting for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and, if applicable, the advisory
vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection
therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board shall be permitted
to adjourn, delay or postpone the Company Meeting in accordance with
applicable law (but not beyond the Outside Date) (i) if the Company Board has
determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel that the
failure to so adjourn, delay or postpone the Company Meeting would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, (ii) to the extent necessary to allow reasonable additional
time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure
which the Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with
outside counsel is reasonably likely to be necessary or appropriate under
applicable law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by the Companys shareholders prior to the Company
Meeting or (iii) if there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Meeting. Except to the extent that
the Company Board shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change
in accordance with Section 6.1(b), the Company, through the Company Board,
shall (A) recommend to its shareholders that they approve this Agreement
(the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ") and (B) include such recommendation
in the Proxy Statement.

6.3 _Nasdaq Listing_. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to continue the listing of the Company Common Stock on Nasdaq. Each of
the parties hereto agrees to cooperate with the other parties hereto and to
use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary to delist the Company Common Stock from Nasdaq as promptly as
possible following the Effective Time and the deregistration of the Company
Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such
delisting.

6.4 _Confidentiality; Access to Information_.

 

(a) Except as expressly modified herein, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. 

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, notwithstanding anything in the
Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall (and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to the Parent and the Parents
Representatives, reasonable access, upon reasonable notice, during normal
business hours and in a manner that does not unreasonably disrupt or interfere
with business operations, to all of its employees (subject to this Section
6.4(b)),

 



41  properties, books, contracts and records as the Parent shall reasonably
request, and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the Parent (i) a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received
by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities laws and (ii) all other information concerning its employees
(subject to this Section 6.4(b)), business, properties and assets as the
Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall
not be required to permit any inspection or other access, or to disclose any
information, (A) to the extent related to an Acquisition Proposal or a Trigger
Event (except as otherwise expressly required by Section 6.1(a), Section
6.1(b) or Section 6.1(c)), or (B) that in the reasonable judgment of the
Company (after consultation with outside legal counsel) would: (1) result in
the disclosure of any trade secrets of any third party, (2) violate any legal
requirement or contract (including confidentiality provisions thereof), or
(3) jeopardize protections afforded the Company under the attorney-client
privilege or the attorney work product doctrine (so long as in connection with
this clause (B) the Company has used commercially reasonable efforts to make
appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure, to the
extent permitted by applicable law and practicable under the circumstances);
_provided further_ , that the Company shall not be required to provide access
to its employees other than (x) the employees set forth in Section 6.4(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, or (y) pursuant to a reasonable integration
plan that will be agreed in good faith by the Company and the Parent as
promptly as practicable following the date hereof, or (z) as otherwise
reasonably approved by the Company. Any such information shall be subject to
the Confidentiality Agreement. Prior to the Closing, neither the Parent nor
the Merger Sub shall (and each shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives
not to) contact or communicate with any of the employees (other than the
employees set forth in Section 6.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and
other than employees identified in and pursuant to a reasonable integration
plan that will be agreed in good faith by the Company and the Parent as
promptly as practicable following the date hereof), licensors, customers or
suppliers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, without the
prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), it being understood that (I) the Company
will cooperate in good faith with the Parent to arrange for an appropriate
response to unsolicited outreach to the Parent or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives by such licensors, customers or suppliers (which response
shall include, at the Companys request, a representative of the Company),
(II) this Section 6.4(b) shall not prohibit the Parent or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives from contacting such licensors, customers or
suppliers in the Ordinary Course of Business if such contacts are unrelated to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (III) incidental
contact with such licensors, customers or suppliers by Representatives or
portfolio companies (or Representatives of portfolio companies) of the Parent
or the Parents Affiliates without the Parents advance knowledge or
instructions shall not be deemed a breach of this Section 6.4(b).

6.5 _Legal Conditions to the Merger_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms hereof, including Section 6.1, Section 6.5(b),
Section 6.5(c) and Section 6.5(d), each party hereto shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to:

(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable;

 



42 (ii) as promptly as practicable, obtain any consents, licenses, permits,
waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders required to be obtained by such
party (or any of its Subsidiaries) from any Governmental Entity, or third
party listed on Section 6.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, in
connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided,
however_ , that in no event shall the Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries be required to pay any monies (except
for filings or similar fees) or (except, in the case of the Parent or the
Merger Sub, as contemplated by, and subject to, Section 6.5(d)) agree to any
material undertaking in connection with any of the foregoing;

 

(iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings, and thereafter
make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the
Merger required under (A) the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal
or state securities laws, (B) the HSR Act, any other applicable Antitrust Laws
and any related governmental request thereunder and (C) any other applicable
law;

(iv) contest and resist any action, including any administrative or judicial
action, and seek to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) (a " _Restrictive Order_ ") which has the effect of making the
Merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

(v) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.

The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other in connection with the
making of all such filings and submissions contemplated by the foregoing
clauses (ii) or (iii), including providing copies of all such documents to the
non-filing Person and its advisors prior to filing and, if requested,
accepting reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection
therewith. Each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish
to each other all information required for any application or other filing to
be made pursuant to any applicable law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party may,
as each determines is reasonably necessary, designate competitively
sensitive material provided to the other pursuant to this Section 6.4 as
"Outside Counsel Only." Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not
be disclosed by such outside counsel to directors, officers or employees of
the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source
of the materials (the Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal
counsel. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Section 6.5(a)
shall limit any obligation under any other provision in this Section 6.5.

(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section
6.5, each of the Parent and the Company shall (i) as soon as reasonably
practicable and in any event

 



43  within seven (7) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, if
required, make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act (including seeking early termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act) with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (ii) as promptly as practicable make any filings required
or advisable under other applicable Antitrust Laws. None of the Parent, the
Merger Sub or the Company shall commit to or agree with any Governmental
Entity to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act
or other applicable Antitrust Laws or enter into a timing agreement with
any Governmental Entity, without the prior written consent of the other
parties.

(c) Subject to the terms hereof, and without limiting the Parents
obligations under Section 6.5(d), the parties hereto shall, and shall cause
each of their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain any government clearances or
approvals required for the Closing under any Antitrust Law, to respond to any
government requests for information under any Antitrust Law, to cause any
waiting periods under any applicable Antitrust Laws to expire or be
terminated, and to contest and resist any action, including any legislative,
administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any Restrictive Order. The parties hereto shall consult and
cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one
another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in advance, any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law. To the
extent permitted by law or Governmental Entities reviewing the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the parties will provide each other the
opportunity to participate in meetings and other substantive conversations
with any such Governmental Entities.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parent
shall propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is
accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or
businesses of the Parent or, effective as of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation, or their respective Subsidiaries, or otherwise offer to
take or offer to commit to take any action which it is capable of taking and
if the offer is accepted, take or commit to take such action that limits its
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the
businesses, services or assets of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
their respective Subsidiaries, in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any Restrictive Order, which would have the effect of
preventing or delaying the Closing beyond the Outside Date; provided, however,
that neither the Parent nor the Merger Sub shall be required to take any of
the actions under this Section 6.5(d) or any other provision of Section 6.5
that would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

6.6 _Public Disclosure_. Except as may be required by law or stock market
regulations, (a) the press release announcing the execution of this Agreement
shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Company and the Parent and (b) the Parent and the Company shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party
before issuing any other press release or otherwise making any public
statement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement that is not limited to
previously approved statements; _provided_ , _however_ , that these
restrictions shall not apply to any Company communications (or the Parents
or the Merger Subs response thereto) in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal, a Trigger Event or a Recommendation Change Notice.

 



44 6.7 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of the Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Party against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments,
fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified
Party is or was an officer, director, manager, employee or agent of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, while a director, manager or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is or was serving at the request of
the Company or one of its Subsidiaries as an officer, director, manager,
employee or agent of another Person, in respect of acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in each
case to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted to do
so under applicable law. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to
advancement of expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in the defense of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from each of the
Parent and the Surviving Corporation (without duplication) within 10 Business
Days of receipt by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the
Indemnified Party of a request therefor; _provided_ that any Indemnified Party
to whom expenses are to be advanced provides prior to any receipt of such
advances an undertaking, to the extent required by the MBCA or other
applicable law, to repay such advances if it is determined by a final
determination of a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is
not subject to appeal) that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification under applicable law.

(b) From the Effective Time through the six-year anniversary of the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, the articles of organization and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and the Parent shall cause the
articles of organization and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so
contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time than
are set forth in the articles of organization and bylaws of the Company as in
effect on the date of this Agreement.

 

(c) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall either (i)
maintain, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain,
at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from the
Effective Time the Current DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), so long as the annual premium therefor would
not exceed the Maximum Premium, or (ii) purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement
and maintain such endorsement in full force and effect for its full term. If
the Companys or the Surviving Corporations existing insurance expires, is
terminated or canceled during such six-year period or exceeds the Maximum
Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and the Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much directors and officers
liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an
annualized premium not in excess of the

 



45  Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions no less advantageous in the
aggregate to the Indemnified Parties than the Current DandO Insurance.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may,
prior to the Effective Time, purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement, provided
that the Company does not pay more than the Maximum Premium for such Reporting
Tail Endorsement. If a Reporting Tail Endorsement has been purchased by the
Company prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause such Reporting
Tail Endorsement to be maintained in full force and effect for its full term
and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation. 

(d) In the event the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (in the case of a transfer of all or
substantially all the Parents or the Surviving Corporations properties and
assets) (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns (in the case of a transfer of all or
substantially all the Parents or the Surviving Corporations properties and
assets) of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
expressly assume and succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

 

(e) If any Indemnified Party makes any claim for indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this Section 6.7 that is denied by the Parent
and/or the Company or the Surviving Corporation, and a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Party is entitled to such
indemnification or advancement of expenses, then the Parent, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation shall pay the Indemnified Partys costs and
expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with pursuing his or her claims to the fullest
extent permitted by law.

 

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to any Indemnified Party by law, charter, statute,
bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs.

 

6.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt
notice to the Parent, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any
event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause any
representation or warranty of such Person (or, in case of the
Parents obligation to provide notice, any representation or warranty of the
Merger Sub) contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate (i) in the
case of any representation or warranty of the Company, in any manner that
would result in the failure of the condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or
(ii) in the case of any representation or warranty of the Parent or the Merger
Sub, in any material respect, in each case at any time from and after the date
of this Agreement until the Effective Time or (b) any material breach by such
Person (or, in case of the Parents obligation to provide notice, any material
breach by the Merger Sub) of any covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall not
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty in this Agreement
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any remedies that may be
available to the parties hereunder.

 



46 6.9 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time or such shorter
period as a Company Employee remains employed with the Company or its
Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Affiliates, the Parent shall provide, or
shall cause to be provided, to each Company Employee (i) cash compensation
(including salary, wages, commissions and annual bonus) no less favorable in
the aggregate than the cash compensation provided to such employee
immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) other employee benefits that
are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the other benefits provided
to such employee immediately before the Effective Time (excluding equity
incentive awards); _provided_ , _however_ , that the requirements of this
Section 6.9(a) shall not apply to any employee of a Subsidiary if and after
such Subsidiary is sold or disposed of by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to an unaffiliated third party after the Effective Date.

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the New Plans, each Company Employee
shall, subject to applicable law and applicable tax qualification
requirements, be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective
Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company
Employee Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits or for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined
benefit plan.

(c) If any Company Employee (who is not otherwise a party to an agreement
providing for severance benefits) whose employment is terminated on or prior
to the first anniversary of the Effective Time under circumstances under which
such Company Employee would have received severance benefits under the
Company Severance Practices, the Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide that such Company Employee shall be entitled to severance benefits
from the Surviving Corporation that are at least equal to the severance
benefits that would have been paid under such circumstances under the Company
Severance Practices as in existence on the date of this Agreement; provided,
however, that the requirements of this Section 6.9(c) shall not apply to any
employee of a Subsidiary if and after such Subsidiary is sold or disposed of
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to an unaffiliated third party after
the Effective Date.

(d) Subject to the first sentence of Section 6.9(a), nothing in this
Agreement shall otherwise prohibit the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from
amending or terminating (in accordance with any applicable terms), or shall be
construed as creating or amending any Company Employee Plans or any other
compensation or benefit plans, programs, policies, practices, agreements and
arrangements sponsored or maintained by the Company, Parent or any of their
Subsidiaries, including each Company Employee Plan and New Plan, and nothing
in this Agreement shall otherwise require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
create or continue any particular compensation or benefit plan, program,
policy, practice, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time or to
employ any particular person on any particular terms. The provisions of this
Section 6.9 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former employee, officer, director, manager or consultant, or
any other individual

 



47  associated therewith, shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party
beneficiary of this Section 6.9. The provisions of Sections 6.9(a) through
6.9(c) shall not apply to persons employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries outside the United States, it being agreed that such persons
shall be treated in accordance with applicable law and the terms of any
contracts covering them.

 

6.10 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "business combination" or
"control share acquisition" statute or other similar anti-takeover statute or
regulation (collectively, an " _Anti-Takeover Law_ ") is or may become
applicable to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company, the Company Board, the Parent and the Merger Sub, as applicable,
each shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to (a) take such actions
as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereunder
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
hereby and (b) otherwise take all such actions as are reasonably necessary to
eliminate the effects of any such statute or regulation on such transactions;
_provided_ that, the Parent and the Merger Sub shall only be required to take
any action pursuant to this Section 6.10 if they have received written notice
from the Company regarding the applicability of such Anti-Takeover Law and the
Company has requested in such written notice that the Parent and the Merger
Sub take specified actions to render such Antitakeover Law inapplicable.

6.11 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
reasonable steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company
equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company and who would otherwise be subject to Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to be exempt under such rule to the
extent permitted by applicable law.

 

6.12 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys rights
or obligations under this Agreement, (a) nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give the Parent or the Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective Time and (b)
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
and its Subsidiaries operations.

 

6.13 _Security Holder Litigation_. In the event that any litigation related to
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby is
brought by any shareholder of the Company or any holder of the Companys other
securities against the Company and/or its directors or officers, the Company
shall promptly notify the Parent of such litigation and shall keep the Parent
reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein (but subject to the following sentence), the
Company shall have the right to control the defense and, subject to
this Section 6.13, settlement of any litigation related to this Agreement,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement brought by
any shareholder of the Company or any holder of the Companys other securities
against the Company and/or its directors or officers, provided that the
Company shall give the Parent the opportunity to participate, at the Parents
expense, in the defense, settlement or mooting of any such litigation and the
Company shall give due consideration to the Parents advice with respect to
the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company shall not settle or agree to moot or enter into any 

 



48  agreement with respect to the settlement or mootness of any such litigation
without the prior written consent of the Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed); _provided_ that the Parents
consent shall not be required if the settlement or agreement to moot involves
(a) solely the payment of an aggregate amount not to exceed the amount set
forth in Section 6.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and supplemental
disclosure (provided that the Parent shall be given reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any supplemental disclosure and the Company shall
consider in good faith any reasonable changes thereto proposed by the
Parent), (b) no admission of wrongdoing or liability, (c) no injunctive or
similar relief, (d) a complete and unconditional release by the named
plaintiffs of all defendants in respect of all disclosure claims then
pending relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby and (e) the withdrawal or dismissal of all claims and
actions then pending relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Parent and the Company shall
notify the other promptly of the commencement of any such shareholder
litigation of which it has received notice.

 

6.14 _Financing_.

(a) Each of the Parent and the Merger Sub shall use, and shall cause its
Affiliates to use, reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and subject
only to the conditions (including the market flex provisions) set forth in the
Financing Letters, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
effect and comply with the Financing Letters, (ii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and
subject only to the conditions (including the market flex provisions) set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) satisfy (and cause its Affiliates
to satisfy) on a timely basis all conditions applicable to the Parent and its
Affiliates in the Financing Letters and the definitive agreements related
thereto (or, if necessary or deemed advisable by Parent, seek the waiver of
conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub contained in such Financing
Letter or such definitive agreements related thereto), (iv) consummate the
Financing at or prior to the Closing Date, including using its (and causing
its Affiliates to use) reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and the
other Persons committing to fund the Financing to fund the Financing at the
Closing, (v) enforce its rights under the Financing Letters and the definitive
agreements relating to the Financing and (vi) comply with its covenants and
other obligations under the Financing Letters and the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing. Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to, take any action not otherwise required under this Agreement
that could reasonably be expected to result in termination of any of the
Financing Letters. Parent, Merger Sub and the Guarantors shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Company, agree to or permit any termination
of or amendment, supplement or modification to be made to, or grant any waiver
of any provision under, the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing if such termination, amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver could reasonably be expected to (A)(1) reduce (or could
have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Financing or (2)
reduce the amount of Equity Financing unless the Debt Financing is increased
by a corresponding amount no later than the date of such amendment,
modification or waiver and, after giving effect thereto, the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 4.5 shall be true and correct, (B) impose
new or additional conditions precedent to the availability of the Financing
or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions precedent to the

 



49  Financing, or otherwise expand, amend or modify any other provision of the
Financing Letters in a manner that could reasonably be expected to delay or
prevent or make less likely to occur the funding of the Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the Closing Date or (C)
adversely impact the ability of the Parent, the Merger Sub or (with respect to
the Equity Financing) the Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights to
cause the Financing to be completed pursuant to the Financing Letters. The
Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of any amendment,
modification, supplement, consent or waiver to or under any Financing
Letter promptly following execution thereof.

(b) The Parent shall keep the Company generally informed on a current basis
(and shall provide such details as shall be reasonably requested by the
Company) of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and
provide to the Company drafts of the definitive documents for the Debt
Financing promptly following request, the proposed final definitive
agreements for the Debt Financing not less than two (2) Business Days prior to
the anticipated date of execution thereof and thereafter complete, correct and
executed copies of the material definitive documents for the Debt Financing.
The Parent and the Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice (i) of any
breach, default (or any event that, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any default or
breach), termination, cancellation or repudiation by any party to any of the
Financing Letters or definitive documents related to the Financing of which
the Parent or the Merger Sub becomes aware, (ii) of the receipt of any written
notice or other written communication from any Financing source with respect
to any (A) breach, default, termination, cancellation or repudiation by any
party to any of the Financing Letters or any definitive document related to
the Financing of any provisions of the Financing Letters or any definitive
document related to the Financing or (B) material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to any of the Financing Letters or any definitive
document related to the Financing and (iii) of the occurrence of an event or
development that could reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability
of the Parent or the Merger Sub to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
contemplated by the Financing Letters on the terms and conditions, in the
manner and from the sources contemplated by any of the Financing Letters or
the definitive documents related to the Financing (or if at any time for any
other reason the Parent or the Merger Sub believes that it will not be able
to obtain all or any portion of the Financing contemplated by the Financing
Letters on the terms and conditions, in the manner and from the sources
contemplated by any of the Financing Letters or the definitive documents
related to the Financing). As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any
event within two Business Days of the date the Company delivers to the Parent
or the Merger Sub a written request, the Parent and the Merger Sub shall
provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any
circumstance referred to in the immediately preceding sentence. If any portion
of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including any applicable market flex provisions) contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, and such portion is required to fund the Merger
Consideration and all fees, expenses and other amounts contemplated to be paid
by the Parent pursuant to this Agreement, or the Parent becomes aware of
any event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to make any such
portion of the Debt Financing unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including any applicable market flex provisions) contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, the Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing
and the Parent and the Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain in replacement thereof, and negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing from alternative
sources in an amount, together with the

 



50  Equity Financing and the available unrestricted cash of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, sufficient to consummate the Transactions with conditions not
less favorable to the Parent and the Merger Sub (or their respective
Affiliates) than the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Parent and the Merger Sub shall not be required to
accept any such alternate financing if the terms thereof are materially less
favorable (taken as a whole) than the terms contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter on the date hereof. The Parent shall deliver to the Company true
and complete copies of all contracts, agreements or other arrangements
(including Redacted Fee Letters) pursuant to which any such alternative source
shall have committed to provide any portion of the Debt Financing. For
purposes of this Section 6.14, (w) references to the "Financing" shall
include the financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as permitted to be
amended, modified, supplemented or replaced by this Section 6.14, (x)
references to the "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such documents as
permitted to be amended, modified, supplemented or replaced by this Section
6.14, (y) references to "Debt Financing" shall include the debt
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted to be
amended, modified, supplemented or replaced by this Section 6.14, and (z)
references to "Debt Financing Sources" shall include the Debt Financing
Sources as defined above as permitted to be replaced by this Section 6.14.

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to provide, and to cause its Subsidiaries to provide, to the
Parent and the Merger Sub, in each case at the Parents sole cost and expense,
such reasonable cooperation as is customary and reasonably requested by the
Parent in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, including
(i) using reasonable best efforts to (A) assist the Parent in obtaining
customary legal opinions, surveys and title insurance as reasonably requested
by the Debt Financing Sources and customary for financings similar to the
Debt Financing; (B) assist the Parent in facilitating the execution and
delivery of one or more credit or other agreements in connection with the Debt
Financing as well as any pledge and security documents, currency or interest
hedging arrangements, other definitive financing documents, or other customary
certificates or documents as may be reasonably requested by the Debt Financing
Sources (including a certificate with respect to solvency matters of the
Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis) and otherwise reasonably
facilitating the pledging of collateral, but in no event shall any of the
foregoing be effective until as of or after the Closing; (C) prior to
the Closing Date, providing such documentation and other information about
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as is reasonably requested in writing
by the Debt Financing Sources at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date with respect to applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act; and (D)
arrange for the repayment on the Closing Date of any outstanding funded
indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries from the proceeds of the
Financing contemplated hereby and using reasonable best efforts to obtain in
respect of such indebtedness customary payoff letters, lien terminations,
title transfers and instruments of discharge or transfer relating to any
collateral to be delivered at the Closing Date, and (ii) using its reasonable
best efforts to furnish the Parent, the Merger Sub and the Debt Financing
Sources (A) within 40 days after the end of any fiscal quarter ending after
the date hereof that is not a fiscal year end, with the unaudited consolidated
balance sheet of the Company as of the end of such quarter and the related
unaudited statements of income and cash flows, (B) within 60 days after the
end of any fiscal year ending after the date hereof with the audited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the end of such fiscal year
and the

 



51  related audited statements of income and cash flows; (C) to the extent
requested with specificity and in writing, such other pertinent and customary
financial and other information as the Parent shall reasonably request of a
type and form customarily included in marketing materials for a senior secured
bank financing or an offering memorandum with respect to a private placement
of high yield debt securities pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act,
as applicable, and subject to exceptions customary for such financings and (D)
reasonably promptly after the end of each calendar month, preliminary monthly
income statements for each of the Companys Medical Imaging, Ultrasound and
Security segments (including preliminary monthly income statements for each of
the Computed Tomography, Power/MRI, Motion and Mammography subsegments of the
Medical Imaging segment) and a preliminary consolidated Company balance
sheet, in each case in such format as provided by the Company to the Parent
prior to the date of this Agreement ( _provided_ that in no event shall the
Company be required to provide (1) any information regarding any post-Closing
or pro forma financial statements, post-Closing pro forma adjustments desired
to be incorporated into any information used in connection with the Financing
(including any synergies or cost savings), projections, ownership or an as-
adjusted capitalization table or any financial statements or information not
available to the Company and prepared in the ordinary course of its financial
reporting practice, (2) any description of all or any component of the
Financing, including any such description to be included in liquidity and
capital resources disclosure or any "description of notes", or other
information customarily provided by the Financing sources or their counsel,
(3) risk factors relating to all or any component of the Financing, (4)
subsidiary financial statements or any other information of the type required
by Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X, (5) Compensation
Disclosure and Analysis required by Regulation S-K Item 402(b) or (6) other
information customarily excluded from a Rule 144A offering memorandum). Such
requested cooperation shall not, in the Companys reasonable judgment,
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or operations of the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries. In no event shall the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries be required to bear any cost or expense, pay any commitment or
other fee, enter into any definitive agreement, incur any other liability or
obligation, make any other payment or agree to provide any indemnity in
connection with the Financing or any of the foregoing prior to the Effective
Time. In addition, nothing in this Section 6.14 shall require any action that
would conflict with or violate the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries
organizational documents or any laws, rules or regulations or result in, prior
to the Effective Time, the contravention of, or that would reasonably be
expected to result in, prior to the Effective Time, a violation or breach of,
or default under, any contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors (with respect to any
Subsidiary of the Company) or employees shall be required to execute or enter
into or perform any agreement, certificate or other document with respect to
the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters that is not contingent
upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing and no
directors of the Company shall be required to execute or enter into or perform
any agreement, or to pass any resolutions or consents, with respect to the
Financing. The Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including (x)
reasonable attorneys fees and (y) reasonably incurred fees and expenses of
the Companys accounting firms engaged to assist in connection with the
Financing) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives in connection with the Financing, including the
cooperation of the Company or any of its

 



52  Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives contemplated by this
Section 6.14 and the compliance by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives with its obligations under this
Section 6.14, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all
losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of
them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information
used in connection therewith, including compliance by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives with its
obligations under this Section 6.14. Nothing contained in this Section 6.14 or
otherwise shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be an issuer
or obligor with respect to the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time. 

(d) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, refrain from taking,
directly or indirectly, any action that could reasonably be expected to
result in the failure of any of the conditions contained in the Financing
Letters or in any definitive agreement relating to the Financing that are
within its control. The Parent and the Merger Sub acknowledge and agree
that, notwithstanding the Companys obligations under Section 6.14(c) (but
subject to the applicable conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section
7.3), none of the obtaining of the Financing or any permitted alternative
financing, or the completion of any issuance of securities contemplated by
the Financing, is a condition to the Closing, and reaffirm their obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and
independently of the availability of the Financing or any permitted
alternative financing or the completion of any such issuance, subject to the
applicable conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3.

 

(e) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company
obtained by the Parent or its Representatives pursuant to clause (c) above
shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ that, upon notice to the Company, the Parent may provide such
information to potential sources of capital and to rating agencies
and prospective lenders and investors during syndication of the Debt
Financing (including any permitted alternative financing) subject to customary
confidentiality arrangements with such Persons regarding such information.

party. Such extension or waiver shall not apply to any time for performance,
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any
agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than that which is specified
in the extension or waiver. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of
its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
such rights.

of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, an amendment, modification or
supplement of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4 or an extension or waiver

or provision (or part thereof) with a term or provision (or part thereof) that
is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention
of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision (or part thereof), and this
Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does
not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties
hereto shall replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision (or part

73 10.10 _Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Person will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Person, and
the exercise by a Person of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

 

(b) Irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were
otherwise breached, as money damages or other legal remedies (including any
fees payable pursuant to Section 8.3), even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy for any such damages, including if the parties hereto fail to
take any action required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement.
Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company,
on the one hand, or the Parent and/or the Merger Sub, on the other hand, of
any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement,
the Company, on the one hand, and the Parent and the Merger Sub, on the other
hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, by the other (as
applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other under
this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or other security. The
parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the provisions set forth in Section 8.3
and 10.10(c) (A) are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the
harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and (B) shall not be
construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any partys right to
specific enforcement and (c) the right of specific enforcement is an integral
part of the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor the
Parent would have entered into this Agreement. No party hereto shall raise any
objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance
to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, or
to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the parties under this Agreement. Time shall be
of the essence for purposes of this Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

(i) in the event that the Company shall terminate this Agreement and receive
full payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(c),
together with any reimbursement of any applicable expenses pursuant to Section
8.3(d), the receipt of the Parent Termination Fee together with such expenses
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all losses or damages
suffered or incurred by the Company or any of its Affiliates or any other
Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the
Financing Letters or the Guarantee, the Transactions (and the abandonment
or termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination,
and none of the Company or any of its Affiliates or any other Person shall be
entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the
Parent, the Merger Sub, the Guarantors, any of their respective Affiliates,
or any former, current or future general or limited partners, equityholders,
financing sources, managers, members, directors or officers of any of the
foregoing (collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") arising out of or
in connection with this Agreement, the Financing Letters or the Guarantee, any
of the

 



74  Transactions (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters
forming the basis for such termination (but excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Confidentiality Agreement);  _provided_ that nothing in this
Section 10.10(c) shall limit the rights of the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives under the Confidentiality Agreement or to be
indemnified and reimbursed for expenses in accordance with Section 6.14(c);
and

(ii) in the event that the Parent or its designee shall receive full payment
of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b), together with any
reimbursement of applicable expenses pursuant to Section 8.3(d), the receipt
of the Termination Fee and any applicable expenses referred to in Section
8.3(d) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all losses or
damages suffered or incurred by the Parent, the Merger Sub, any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement
(and the termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment or
termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and
none of the Parent, the Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any
other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or
proceeding against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners,
shareholders, managers, members or Affiliates (collectively, " _Company
Related Parties_ ") arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any
of the Transactions or any matters forming the basis for such termination.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, while each of the Company and the Parent may
pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with Section
10.10(b) and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee or the Termination
Fee, as applicable, under Section 8.3(b) or Section 8.3(c) and the
reimbursement of expenses under Section 8.3(d) or the recovery of monetary
damages, under Section 8.2(a), under no circumstances shall the Company or
Parent be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance that results in a Closing and any money damages, including all or
any portion of the Parent Termination Fee or the Termination Fee, as
applicable. The parties acknowledge and agree that the fact that the parties
have agreed to this Section 10.10(c) shall not be deemed to affect any partys
right to specific performance under Section 10.10(b). The parties expressly
acknowledge and agree that, in light of the difficulty of accurately
determining actual damages with respect to the foregoing upon any such
termination of this Agreement under circumstances in which the Parent
Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section 8.3(c) or the Termination Fee
is payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b), the right to such applicable payment
(A) constitutes a reasonable estimate of the damages that will be suffered by
reason of any such termination of this Agreement and (B) shall be in full and
complete satisfaction of any and all damages arising under this Agreement.

 

10.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Except as provided in Section 10.15, each
of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the exclusive personal
jurisdiction of the Business Litigation Session of the Superior Court of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, a
federal court sitting in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in
respect of such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in any
such court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, and (d) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement in any other court. Each of

 



75  the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety
or other security that might be required of any other Person with respect
thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another party by sending or
delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address and
in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 10.2. Nothing in
this Section 10.10, however, shall affect the right of any Person to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by law.

 

10.12 _Disclosure Schedule_. The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged
in Sections corresponding to the numbered sections contained in this
Agreement, and the disclosure in any section shall qualify (a) the
corresponding section of this Agreement and (b) the other sections of this
Agreement, to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of
such disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such other sections;
provided that no disclosure in any Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall modify or qualify any provision of Section 5.1 unless such disclosure is
expressly included in Section 5.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The
inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be
deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such
information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has
resulted in or would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or is outside
the Ordinary Course of Business.

 

10.13 _Parent Guarantee_. The Parent agrees to take all action necessary to
cause the Merger Sub or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, to perform all of its agreements, covenants and obligations
under this Agreement. The Parent unconditionally guarantees to the Company the
full and complete performance by the Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, of its respective obligations under this Agreement and shall be
liable for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation
of the Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, under
this Agreement. The Parent hereby waives any right to require any proceeding
first against the Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation in connection with
the performance of the Parents obligations set forth in this Section 10.13.

 

10.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING THE
MERGER. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATION OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY,
AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

 



76 10.15 _Debt Financing Sources Provisions_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto: (a) agrees
that it will not bring or support any Person in any suit, action or proceeding
of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise, against any Debt Financing Source in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, but not limited to, any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the federal
and New York state courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City
of New York; (b) agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Debt Financing Sources
in any way relating to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance
thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New
York, without giving effect to principles or rules or conflict of laws to the
extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of
laws of another jurisdiction; and (c) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
litigation (whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise) directly or indirectly arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, (i) none of the Company or its Subsidiaries (collectively,
together with any of their respective Subsidiaries, directors, officers,
employees, agents, partners, managers, members, shareholders, or successors
or assigns, the " _Company Group_ ") shall have any rights or claims against
any Debt Financing Source, in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Commitment Letter, or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Debt Commitment Letter, or in respect of any oral representations made
or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment
Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and (ii) no Debt
Financing Source shall have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or
otherwise) to any member of the Company Group for any obligations or
liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to
have been made in connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation
of law, (iii) under Section 61 or 62 of Chapter 156B of the Massachusetts
General Laws, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived any
improper personal benefit. No amendment to or repeal of this paragraph shall

director of the corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of
such director occurring prior to the date of such amendment or repeal.
