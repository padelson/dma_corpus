be: (a) the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities as provided for in Section
3.1; and (b) a total purchase price (the "Purchase Price") of Five Hundred

Section 4.2), payable by Purchaser at Closing by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account of CHP in accordance with the wiring
instructions set forth on _Schedule 4.1_.

4.2. _Net Working Capital, Estimates and Audits_.

(a) _Net Working Capital_. As used herein, the term "Net Working Capital"
shall mean the aggregate current assets of Sellers conveyed to Purchaser
pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof (excluding those Excluded Assets which would
otherwise be included in current assets), minus the aggregate current
liabilities of Sellers assumed by Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof
(excluding those Retained Liabilities which would otherwise be included in
current liabilities), all as determined in accordance with GAAP. In any case
with respect to the computation of Net Working Capital (i) the following
shall be included in current assets: inventories, supplies, and the prepaid
expenses set forth on _Schedule 2.1.3_ and (ii) the following shall be
included in current liabilities: accrued paid time off assumed by Purchaser
under Section 3.1.2 and the value of medical and dependent care flexible
spending account balances assumed by Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.1.4. For
the sake of clarification, Accounts Receivable, cash and cash equivalents,
prepaid expenses (other than those set forth on _Schedule 2.1.3)_ ,
investments, funds restricted by donors, funds held by trustee, other
receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses shall not be included in
Net Working Capital.

(b) _Estimates and Adjustments_. At least ten (10) business days prior to
Closing, Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser a reasonable estimate of Net
Working Capital as of the end of the most recently ended calendar month prior
to the Closing Date for which financial statements are available (the
"Estimated Working Capital") and containing reasonable detail and supporting
documents showing the derivation of such estimate. The value of Inventory for
purposes of determining the Estimated Working Capital will be determined as
set forth in Section 4.2(c) below. Subject to the mutual agreement of Sellers
and Purchaser, the Estimated Net Working Capital together with the principles,
specifications and methodologies for determining the Estimated Net Working
Capital, shall be specified in _Schedule 4.3_ and, together with the amounts
determined under Section 4.2(c) with respect to Inventory, shall be used for
purposes of calculating the Purchase Price as of the Closing. Within sixty
(60) days after the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to Sellers its
determination of the Net Working Capital as of the Closing (the "Final Net
Working Capital") following the same principles, specifications and
methodologies used to determine the Estimated Net Working Capital as
set forth on _Schedule 4.2_ ). Each Party shall have full access to the
financial books and records pertaining to the Purchased Assets to confirm or
audit Net Working Capital computations. Should Sellers disagree with
Purchasers determination of the Final Net Working Capital, they shall notify
Purchaser within thirty (30) days after Purchasers delivery of its
determination of the Final Net

 



\- 10 -   Working Capital. If Sellers and Purchaser fail to agree within thirty (30)
days after Sellers delivery of notice of disagreement on the amount of the
Final Net Working Capital, such disagreement shall be resolved in accordance
with the procedure set forth in Section 4.2(d) which shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy for resolving accounting disputes relative to the
determination of the Final Net Working Capital. At Closing, the Purchase
Price shall be increased by the amount of the Estimated Net Working Capital if
it is positive or decreased by the amount of the Estimated Net Working Capital
if it is negative. Within five (5) business days after determination of the
Final Net Working Capital, Purchaser shall pay Sellers the difference between
the Final Net Working Capital and the Estimated Net Working Capital if the
Final Net Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Net Working
Capital or Sellers will pay Purchaser the difference between the Estimated
Net Working Capital and the Final Net Working Capital if the Estimated Net
Working Capital is greater than the Final Net Working Capital.

 

(c) _Inventory._ Not more than fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing,
employees or representatives of Sellers and Purchaser, along with a mutually
agreed upon independent third party inspector that has experience in physical
inspections of inventory (an "Inventory Inspector"), shall meet at the
Healthcare Facilities to collectively conduct a physical inspection of the
items of Inventory then in existence. Purchaser shall have the right at its
reasonable sole discretion to exclude any items of Inventory it does not wish
to acquire, by providing written notice thereof to Sellers at or following
the physical inspection process described hereby, but in no event more than
five (5) days prior to Closing. Purchaser shall acquire from Sellers at
Closing all items of Inventory not so excluded by Purchaser, and the Estimated
Net Working Capital will include an amount equal to Sellers cost of
acquisition of such acquired Inventory, as reflected on the Financial
Statements and Sellers books and records. Each Party shall be responsible for
the costs and expenses of its respective employees or representatives
incurred in connection with the physical inspection described in this Section
4.2(c). All fees and expenses of the Inventory Inspector will be borne and
paid one-half by Sellers and one-half by Purchaser.

(d) _Dispute of Adjustments_. In the event that Sellers and Purchaser are not
able to agree on the actual Final Net Working Capital within thirty (30) days
after Sellers delivery of notice of disagreement, Sellers and Purchaser shall
each have the right to require that such disputed determination be submitted
to KPMG LLP or if KPMG LLP is not available for any reason or does not
maintain its independent status, such other independent certified public
accounting firm as Sellers and Purchaser may then mutually agree upon in
writing (the "Accounting Firm") for computation or verification in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement. The Accounting Firm shall review the
matters in dispute and, acting as arbitrators, shall promptly decide the

ARTICLE 5.

 

 _ADDITIONAL POST-CLOSING AGREEMENTS/OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES_

 

5.1. _Employment of Employees; Additional Employee Matters_. Purchaser and, as
appropriate, other Purchaser Affiliates, will make good faith offers of
employment effective as of 12:01 A.M on the Closing Date, contingent upon the
consummation of the Transactions, with a commitment not to terminate, except
for cause as reasonably determined by Purchaser (i.e., with a legitimate
reason with respect to such employees job performance or conduct), any such
employment for a period of at least one year following the Closing Date, to
all of Sellers employees then providing services to the
Healthcare Facilities in the MHP-TN REGION ("Employees"), for positions with
comparable duties, responsibilities and job status (i.e. full-time, part-time,
per diem, etc.) and at wages at least equal to wages earned by Employees
actively employed the day before Closing as listed on _Schedule 5.1(a)_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchasers obligation to retain the Employees
set forth in _Schedule 5.1(b)_ in

 



\- 12 -   accordance with this Section 5.1 shall be limited to six months.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be required to offer to
employ any medical transcriptionists currently employed by Sellers as set
forth on _Schedule 5.1(c)_ and will use reasonable efforts to cause all such
persons to be offered employment by the third party transcription service
engaged by Purchaser, and Purchaser may also elect not to make offers to
categories of Employees other than medical transcriptionists if a vendor of
Purchaser has agreed to make offers of employment to such Employees. All
Employees who accept the Purchasers offer of employment shall be referred to
herein as the _"_ Hired Employees _"_. Further, notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser may elect in its sole discretion to terminate any Hired
Employee without cause as defined herein prior to the expiration of the
applicable twelve (12) or six (6) month period as set forth herein
("Retention Period"). For any such terminated Hired Employee who is not a
Senior Management Employee, the Purchaser will provide such terminated Hired
Employee with continuation of such Hired Employees then current salary and
group health benefits at the same premium cost applicable to active employees
for the greater of (i) the duration of the remaining Retention Period
applicable to such terminated Hired Employee or (ii) the period for which the
terminated Hired Employees would be eligible for such salary and benefits
under Sellers severance pay policy (also known as Sellers Period of Notice
Policy, and which is not assumed by Purchaser) that was previously provided
to Purchaser by Sellers and which is in effect on the date hereof, measured
from the Closing Date. Such continuation of group health benefits during the
Retention Period shall be in addition to any period of continuation or group
health benefits for which Hired Employees otherwise are eligible for COBRA.
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for all WARN Act compliance requirements
arising from such terminations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as of
the Closing Date Purchaser shall extend only conditional offers of employment
to all Employees who as of the Closing Date are on leave of absence status
pursuant to military leave or other types of leave that provide a legal right
of reemployment upon termination or expiration of such leave (collectively,
the "Inactive Employees") and such offers shall be conditioned as follows. If
an Inactive Employee is cleared to return to work at the end of such leave and
within one year of the Closing Date (or such longer period as may be required
by applicable law), Purchaser shall thereupon convert the conditional offer of
employment to an offer of immediate employment. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser reserves the right not to hire an Employee or continue the
employment of any Hired Employee for reasonable cause (i.e., with a legitimate
reason with respect to such employees job performance or conduct), upon
reasonable advance notice to Sellers if prior to the Closing. Except as
otherwise provided herein, nothing herein shall be deemed to affect or limit
in any way normal management prerogatives of Purchaser with respect to
employees. Nothing herein shall be deemed to create or grant to any such
employees third-party beneficiary rights or claims of any kind or nature.
Purchaser shall provide Hired Employees with employee benefits which are
substantially similar to the benefits generally offered to employees of other
Affiliates of Purchaser. Purchaser shall recognize the existing seniority and
service credit with any Seller of all Hired Employees for benefits purposes in
Purchasers retirement plans and other plans which consider seniority
(including but not limited to leave accrual rates and separation pay if
applicable) and shall provide credit under such retirement and other plans for
purposes of determining eligibility and vesting, but not for purposes of
determining the amount of benefits under such plans; provided, however, that
no such credit need be given in respect of any new plan commenced or
participated in by Purchaser in which no prior service credit is given or
recognized to or for other plan beneficiaries. Purchaser shall recognize
service credit with any Seller of all Hired Employees for purposes of

 



\- 13 -   the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, Purchaser shall offer to employ a sufficient number of
Employees so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not
constitute a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those terms are used in the
WARN Act.

5.1.2. _Group Health and Welfare Benefit Plans_. Purchaser shall provide that
with respect to all Hired Employees and their dependents who are eligible
under the terms of Purchasers group health plans and who elect coverage
under such group health plans, any amounts which have been applied toward
satisfaction of calendar year 2011 copayments, deductibles, and out-of-pocket
maximums under plans of Sellers shall be deemed to be applied toward
satisfaction of calendar year 2011 copayments, deductibles, and out-of-pocket
maximums under plans of Purchaser. Purchaser shall cause its employee welfare
benefit plans to waive any exclusions or limitations for pre-
existing conditions and waiting periods with respect to conditions affecting
any Hired Employee or dependent as of the Closing Date to the extent that such
exclusion or limitation was waived for such Hired Employee or dependent under
Sellers plans. Purchaser shall cause its flexible spending account plans to
implement the 2011 elections made by Hired Employees under Sellers flexible
spending account plans and shall assume liability for reimbursement claims for
Hired Employees with respect to calendar year 2011 that are submitted for
reimbursement on or after the Closing Date. Sellers shall provide Purchaser
with such data as may be necessary for Purchaser to implement Hired Employee
Elections and all claims for reimbursement shall be subject to the terms of
Purchasers flexible spending account plans. As soon as practicable, but not
more than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Sellers shall pay Purchaser
an amount in cash equal to (i) the sum of all Hired Employee contributions to
Sellers flexible spending account plans for the 2011 calendar year made prior
to the Closing Date, reduced by (ii) the sum of all claims incurred by Hired
Employees during the 2011 calendar year that are paid by Sellers flexible
spending account plans (and chargeable to Hired Employees 2011 account
balances) prior to such cash transfer from Sellers to Purchaser.

5.1.3. _COBRA_. To the extent COBRA applies to Sellers group health plans,
Purchaser will offer and provide continuation coverage for all "MandA Qualified
Beneficiaries" as that term is defined in section 54.4980B-9 of the COBRA
regulations, including without limitation coverage for employees or former
employees of Seller who are not Hired Employees and their respective spouses
and dependents, and for former employees of Sellers or their dependents whose
COBRA qualifying events occurred prior to the Closing Date and whose COBRA
coverage is in effect as of the Closing Date, or whose election period for
choosing such COBRA coverage has not ended as of the Closing Date, as set
forth on _Schedule 5.1.3._

5.1.4. _MHP Senior Management Transition_. At Closing, Purchaser will enter
into severance agreements with the members of the MHP senior management team
identified on _Schedule 5.1.4_ (each a "Senior Management Employee"), and such
agreements will provide, among other things, (a) that the executive shall
receive a one year severance package from Purchaser equal to at least 100% of
his or her then current annual base salary, payable on a monthly basis, plus
COBRA health care continuation coverage at the same cost as that paid
by active employees if such executive is involuntarily terminated by
Purchaser without cause during the three (3) year period following the
Closing, (b) that the executive will not compete in the Knoxville Service Area
with the Healthcare Facilities during the term of the severance

 



\- 14 -   agreement (" _Non-compete Period_ "), and (c) that the executive will have a
right to terminate the severance agreement prior to expiration of the Non-
compete Period, in which case the executive will be relieved of any further
obligation under the agreement not to compete with the Healthcare Facilities
and the executive will forfeit any outstanding payments or future benefits due
to him or her under the severance agreement.

5.1.5. _Purchaser Plans_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained
herein shall (i) be treated as an amendment to any particular employee
benefit plan of Purchaser, HMA, or their Affiliates, (ii) obligate HMA,
Purchaser or any of their Affiliates to maintain any particular benefit plan
or arrangement or (iii) prevent HMA, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates
from amending or terminating any benefit plan or arrangement. Except as
limited in this Section, Purchaser retains the right to change, modify or
terminate any wages, benefits, policies and procedures in its sole discretion
as it deems appropriate.

5.1.6. _Matters Related to for Sisters of Mercy and the VP of
Mission Integration_.

(a) _Sisters of Mercy_. Purchaser agrees to provide access and facility
support (e.g., offices, telephones, and copier access) to the five Sisters of
Mercy who are performing their ministry and pastoral care at the Hospitals and
in the Knoxville community as of the Closing Date for their continuing
performance of such ministries and pastoral care as long as each Sister
desires and is able to continue such activities and to contribute to the
Sisters of Mercy $42,000 annually for each such Sister performing her ministry
and pastoral care at the end of each year in which she performs such ministry
(prorated for partial years), in accordance with the Mission Services
Agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit G_ (the "Mission Services Agreement").
Such Sisters shall not be employees of Purchaser and shall not be eligible
under Purchasers employee benefit plans. Royalties paid by Purchaser under
the License (as defined below) shall be applied to reduce the contributions to
the Sisters of Mercy under the provisions of the Mission Services Agreement.

(b) _Mission Integration_. Purchaser agrees to maintain a VP of Mission
Integration (or similar position) to administer the interdenominational
chaplaincy program maintained by Purchaser in accordance with Section 5.10.

(a) continue the existing medical staff membership rights and clinical
privileges of the medical staffs ("MHP Physicians") at the Hospitals in
accordance with Medical Staff Bylaws in effect immediately prior to Closing,
to the extent that Purchasers legal counsel reasonably concludes that such
Medical Staff Bylaws are consistent with applicable laws; provided, however,
that the provisions of this Section 5.2.1 will not give rise, or be deemed to
give rise, to any right or right of action in any medical staff member,
other third party or any group thereof; and

 



\- 15 -  (b) assume, honor and comply with all existing written agreements between MHP

interest in all of the Healthcare Facilities located in the Knoxville Service
Area or an equity interest in any single Hospital (collectively, for purposes
of this Section 5.19, the "Interest") (including by gift, sale, bequests, or
other transfers by Purchaser), without first giving CHP a right of first
refusal to purchase the Interest on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Section ("CHPs Right of First Refusal"). 



     | (a) | _Notice of Proposed Transfer_. Purchaser shall deliver to
CHP a written notice ( for purposes of this Section 5.19, the
"Notice") stating: (i) Purchasers bona fide intention to sell or otherwise

(iii) the Interest to be transferred to each Proposed Transferee; (iv) the
bona fide cash price or other consideration for which Purchaser proposes to
transfer the Interest (for purposes of this Section 5.19, the "Offered
Price"); and (v) the material terms and conditions of the proposed transfer

sixty (60) days after receipt of the Notice, CHP may, by giving written notice

under this Section shall be the Offered Price, and the terms and conditions
of the transfer shall be identical in all material respects to the Offer Terms

the non-cash consideration shall be determined by an independent third party
valuation by an appraiser mutually acceptable to Purchaser and CHP. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | _Payment_. Payment of the Purchase Price shall be made, at
the option of CHP, in cash (by check), by cancellation of all or any
outstanding indebtedness of Purchaser to CHP, or by any combination thereof,

above. 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 23 -  Interest proposed in the Notice to be transferred to a given Proposed

provided such sale or other transfer is consummated within one year after the

First Refusal shall survive Closing and shall terminate upon the earlier of
five (5) years following the Closing Date or immediately after the closing of
the first sale of the Interest; provided, however, that a sale of one Hospital
shall not cause a termination of CHPs Right of First Refusal for the
remainder of the Hospitals. CHPs Right of First Refusal shall not apply if
(i) all of HMAs equity interests or substantially all of HMAs assets are
acquired, either directly or indirectly, by another Person, hospital or

forty nine percent (49%) in any one or more Hospitals to physicians. For the
avoidance of doubt, a pledge of any of the assets of the Healthcare
Facilities or Purchasers direct or indirect equity interests in the
Healthcare Facilities as collateral shall not constitute a sale, conveyance or
transfer for purposes of this Section 5.19.  
---|---|---

following the Closing Date, Sellers may not sell, convey, or otherwise

gift, sale, bequests, or other transfers by Sellers), without first giving
Purchaser a right of first refusal to purchase the Interest on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Section (the "Purchasers Right of First
Refusal"). Purchasers Right of First Refusal will not apply to a transfer

Hospitals located in Campbell and/or Jefferson Counties, Tennessee if such
transfer is made either before or following the Closing Date as a condition

proposed in the Notice to be transferred to a given Proposed Transferee is not

otherwise transfer such Interest to that Proposed Transferee at the Offered
Price or at a higher price and on the Offer Terms, provided such sale or other
transfer is consummated within one year after the date of the Notice in which

_PRE-CLOSING COVENANTS OF SELLERS AND CHP (AS APPLICABLE)_

 



\- 42 -  Each Seller and CHP (as applicable) (to the extent not limited below) agrees
with Purchaser that, except as otherwise provided in the following
subsections, between the execution of this Agreement and the earlier of the
Closing or the termination of this Agreement:

11.1. _Preserve Accuracy of Representations and Warranties; Update of
Schedules._

(a) It shall not take any action which would render any representation and/or
warranty contained in _Article 7 or 8_ to be false or materially inaccurate.
Each Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser of any lawsuits, claims,
administrative actions, or other proceedings asserted or commenced against it,
or its officers, directors, shareholders or members involving in any material
way its businesses, properties or assets. It shall promptly notify Purchaser
in writing of any facts or circumstances which come to its attention, and
which it reasonably believe causes, or through the passage of time is likely
to cause, any of its representations and warranties contained in _Article 7 or
8_  to be false or materially inaccurate (which notification shall not be
deemed to cure such falsehood or inaccuracy).

(b) The Parties hereto acknowledge that they have each delivered and agreed
upon the Schedules contemplated by this Agreement, on the date hereof, subject
to the provisions of this Section 11.1(b) regarding amendments to the
Schedules. The Parties hereto further acknowledge that, as of the date
hereof, the Exhibits contemplated by this Agreement, have not been completed
nor agreed to by the Parties. Accordingly, consummation of this Agreement
shall be conditioned upon the completion, to the satisfaction of each Party,
of final forms of the Schedules and Exhibits contemplated by this Agreement
and the Parties agree to use their respective reasonable business efforts to
agree upon completed Exhibits within ninety (90) days after the date of this
Agreement (the "Exhibit Agreement Date"). If the Parties are unable to agree
on a form of an Exhibit to be delivered hereunder by the Exhibit Agreement
Date, then this Agreement may be terminated by either Party upon notice to
the other Party, whereupon the other Party shall be entitled, for a period of
ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, to cure the matter that
triggered the notice. If a Party desires to amend or modify an Exhibit that
had been previously agreed upon (a "Finalized Exhibit"), it will provide the
other Party with a proposed amendment to the Finalized Exhibit in writing. If
a Party becomes aware of a fact or circumstance that causes any previously
delivered Schedule to be inaccurate or incomplete (or to otherwise require
amendment or completion), it shall provide the other Party with an updated
accurate and complete Schedule. The Party that receives an updated Schedule or
amendment to a Finalized Exhibit (the "Approving Party") shall work with the
submitting Party in good faith to review the updated Schedule or amendment to
the Finalized Exhibit and shall not withhold its approval without just cause.
If the Approving Party does not object in writing (including email) to an
updated Schedule or amendment to a Finalized Exhibit prepared by the other
Party (a "Preparing Party") within fifteen (15) days after a draft of such
updated Schedule or amendment to the Finalized Exhibit has been submitted to
the Approving Party (the "Review Date"), the Approving Party shall be deemed
to have approved such updated Schedule or amended Exhibit. If the Approving
Party does object in writing (including by email) to an updated Schedule or
amendment to a Finalized Exhibit prepared by the Preparing Party delivered
hereunder by the Review Date (and with respect to a Schedule the disagreement
is due to the fact that the Schedule (either individually or in the aggregate
with other Schedules) causes a Material Adverse Effect) (and with respect to
an Exhibit the disagreement is due to a Material and

 



\- 43 -   substantive issue that cannot be resolved by the Parties in good faith),
then either Party may give notice of termination to the other Party (the
"Termination Notice"), whereupon the other Party shall be entitled, for a
period of ten (10) days after its receipt of the Termination Notice, to cure
the matter (the "Cure Period"). The Closing shall, if necessary, be postponed
by such period of time as is necessary for the Cure Period to run. The
Parties shall use reasonable business efforts, and work in good faith to cure
the matter. If the matter is cured (and assuming the satisfaction of the other
conditions to each Partys obligations), the Transaction shall close. If not,
either Party may elect not to close the Transaction or negotiate to reduce the
Purchase Price as a remedy for the matter and subsequently close. Upon
agreement as to the Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement, each such
Schedule and Exhibit shall be considered a part hereof as if set forth herein
in full.

in such title reports, title examinations or surveys to which Purchaser does
not object shall become Permitted Exceptions. Purchaser shall be obligated to
act reasonably in identifying any objections pursuant to this Section.
Upon receipt of Purchasers Schedule of Non-Permitted Exceptions, the Sellers
shall have ten (10) days to cure such objections, notify Purchaser in writing
of any liens included as Non-Permitted Exceptions to be released at or prior
to Closing, or notify Purchaser in writing that the Sellers are unwilling or
unable to cure such objections. Sellers shall have no obligation to cure any
such objection listed in Purchasers Schedule of the Non-Permitted Exceptions.
If the Sellers are unable or unwilling to cure any such objections with
respect to any Owned Property that is a Hospital parcel, Purchaser shall have
five (5) days after receipt of Sellers notice to provide written notice to
Sellers of its election to either (a) accept title to the Real Property
subject to such item with an equitable adjustment to the Purchase Price, in
which case the objection shall become a Permitted Exception; or (b) terminate
this Agreement. If the Sellers are unable or unwilling to cure any such
objections with respect to any Owned Property other than a Hospital, Purchaser
shall have five (5) days after receipt of Sellers notice to provide written
notice to Sellers of its election to either (a) accept title to the Real
Property subject to such item, in which case the objection shall become a
Permitted Exception; (b) terminate this Agreement as to the affected Real
Property, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the fair
market value of such Real Property, as mutually agreed upon; or (c) if the
affected Property is material to the operation of MHP and/or an MHP Affiliate,
terminate this Agreement. However, if Purchaser elects option (b) in
the previous sentence, thereby

have the right, for a period of ten (10) days thereafter, to terminate this
Agreement by providing Purchaser with written notice thereof.

obtain environmental site assessments of all Healthcare Facilities.
Purchasers contractor(s) shall perform the environmental investigations

inconvenience, interruption or disruption of operations in the MHP-TN REGION
and shall restore any damage to the property caused by such inspections.
Purchasers contractor shall perform the environmental site assessments in
such a manner as to minimize any inconvenience, interruption or disruption of
"operations" at the Owned Property. Within fifteen (15) days of the date of
this Agreement, Purchaser shall furnish Sellers with copies of the
environmental site assessments so obtained and give Sellers written notice,
based upon the site assessments, of matters which are not Permitted Exceptions
and to which Purchasers object (the "Environmental Objections"). Purchaser
shall be obligated to act reasonably in identifying any Environmental
Objections. Upon Sellers receipt of Purchasers Schedule of Environmental
Objections, the Parties shall, in good faith, use reasonable business efforts
to develop and agree upon a mutually satisfactory way to address
the Environmental Objections. If, despite such good faith negotiations, the
Parties are unable to reach agreement within ninety (90) days after
commencement of such negotiations, Purchaser shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement by providing Sellers with written notice thereof, if the
Environmental Objections would cause a Material Adverse Effect.

13.7  _Hospital Lease Consents and Approvals_. If the Sellers are unable to
obtain on or prior to the Closing Date any consents to assignment, estoppels
or approvals from landlords under the Hospital Lease Agreements (each of which
constitutes a Material Consent pursuant to Section 14.1), Purchaser shall
have a right to either (a) waive the condition to Closing under Section
14.1(d) with respect to such Hospital Lease Agreement, and proceed with
Closing (excluding the applicable Hospital Lease Agreement), subject an
equitable reduction to the Purchase Price or (b) terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Article 17.

notice under this _Article 16_ of any potential claim for indemnity, the
Indemnified Party shall have the exclusive right to make any notices or
disclosures required by law to the government or other person or entity
relating to the facts or circumstances giving rise to any claim or right to
indemnity under this _Article 16_. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume

receipt of the Indemnified Partys written notice of the third party claim,
the Indemnified Party may assume the control of the defense of the third party
claim at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party.

 

The Indemnified Party agrees to notify the Indemnifying Party in writing as
soon as practicable of any facts, circumstances, claims or investigations
that may give rise to a right of indemnity under this _Article 16_ ; provided,
however, in any event such written notice shall not exceed thirty (30) days
after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such facts, circumstances,

 



\- 59 -   claims or investigations, provided, further, however, that any failure by
the Indemnified Party to provide written notice within such thirty (30) day
period shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its obligations under
this _Article 16_ except to the extent the Indemnifying Party was prejudiced
by the delay in receiving the notice. This written notice shall include, to
the extent known by the Indemnified Party, a detailed description of the
facts, circumstances, claims or investigations at issue, a detailed
description of the circumstances under which the facts, circumstances, claims

facts, circumstances, claims or investigations.

The Indemnified Party shall not, except at the Indemnified Partys own
cost, voluntarily disclose to a third party or to the government, make a
payment, assume any obligation, or incur any expense without the Indemnifying
Partys consent in relation to any claim for which the Indemnified Party has
sought indemnity under this _Article 16_ and for which the Indemnifying Party
has assumed control of the defense, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Indemnified Party shall not take any
action, including but not limited to failing to provide a timely notice, that
will prejudice or that is inconsistent with the Indemnifying Partys exclusive
right to investigate, disclose, report, defend, and/or settle any third party
claims for which it has assumed control as provided by this _Article 16_ ,
provided that the claim is being defended in good faith. Any action by the
Indemnified Party that prejudices the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend
any third party claims shall terminate any obligation of the Indemnifying
Party to defend or indemnify the Indemnified Party under this _Article 16_
with respect to the prejudiced claims.

16.4. _Certain Benefits._ The amount of any indemnification payable to any
Party under this _Article 16_ shall be net of any federal, state or local tax

Affiliates) by reason of the claim giving rise to the indemnification payment
to the applicable party. Any claim shall be net of receipt of any insurance
proceeds paid to a Party

 



\- 60 -   under any policy or policies of insurance covering the loss giving rise to
the claim. Each Party will use reasonable business efforts to collect any such
insurance and will account to the other Parties therefor. Each Party agrees
to respond promptly to any inquiry by the other Party as to the status of any
such insurance.

16.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. FROM AND AFTER CLOSING, THE PARTIES AGREE AND
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE 16 SHALL
BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR

obligation of HMA under this provision shall be performed without demand and
shall be unconditional without regard to any extension of time for
performance or payment, forbearance or delay in enforcement of any rights or
remedies, waiver of any right or release of any party or any other
circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge

subrogation or reimbursement against Purchaser by reason of any payment by HMA
under this provision until all payments due to Sellers have been made in full
and there has expired the maximum possible period during which any payment

perform.

 

18.22 _Undesignated Agreements_. Without limiting any provision of Sections
2.1.4, 2.2.12 or 11.1, the parties acknowledge and agree that certain
agreements to which Seller is a party are listed on Schedule 2.1.4 as
"Undesignated" (the "Undesignated Agreements"). The Undesignated Agreements
have not been identified by Purchaser as Assumed Agreements or Excluded
Contracts and do not constitute Assumed Agreements or Excluded Contracts as of
the date of this Agreement, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary. The parties will use all reasonable
business efforts to cause the Undesignated Agreements (and any other
agreements identified or entered into between the date hereof and the Closing)
to be identified and listed as Assumed Agreements on Schedule 2.1.4 or as
Excluded Contracts on Schedule 2.2.12 as promptly as practicable following
the date of this Agreement. Further, the Parties acknowledge that certain
agreements listed on either _Schedule 2.1.4_ as an Assumed Agreement or
_Schedule 2.2.12_ as an Excluded Contract may move from one schedule to the
other, and the Parties shall work with one another in good faith to agree upon
such changes as appropriate.
