Non-Continuing Employee not later than ten days prior to the Closing Date. If
any such Non-Continuing Employee fails to make a timely election before such
deadline, such Non-Continuing Employee shall be deemed to have made an Option
Election to have Parent assume their Company Stock Option under subclause (i)
of this clause (B). The Option Election made by the Non-Continuing Employee

terms of the Company Stock Option award agreement. Following the Effective
Time, no holder of a Company Stock Option that becomes an Assumed Option

2.3(c)(iii)(B)_) shall have any right to receive any shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of such option or any Merger Consideration.

and have the same rights and be subject to the same conditions, as each share
of Company Common Stock not subject to any restrictions; _provided_ , that
upon vesting the holder may satisfy the applicable withholding Tax obligations
by returning to Parent or Merger Sub a sufficient number of shares of Company
Common Stock equal in value to such obligation. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company, the Company Board of Directors and the Committee shall take all
actions necessary under the Company Incentive Plans, the award agreements
thereunder and otherwise to effectuate this _Section 2.4(c)(iv)_.



 

17 (v) _Other Interests_.

(A) Subject to the terms and upon the conditions herein, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, each director deferred stock unit award granted and then
outstanding under Company Incentive Plans (each, a " _Director Award_ ") shall
be fully vested in each holder thereof and the underlying shares of Company
Common Stock shall be issued and will be treated at the Effective Time
the same as, and shall have the same rights and be subject to the same
conditions as, other shares of Company Common Stock; _provided_ that upon
vesting and issuance, the holder may satisfy the applicable withholding Tax
obligations by returning to Parent or Merger Sub a sufficient number of
shares of Company Common Stock equal in value to such obligation. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board of Directors and the Committee
shall take all actions necessary under the Company Incentive Plans, the award
agreements thereunder and otherwise to effectuate this _Section
2.4(c)(v)(A)_.

(B) Subject to the terms and upon the conditions set forth in this _Section
2.4(c)(v)(B)_, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the deferred
performance units award granted and then outstanding under the Company
Incentive Plans (each " _Deferred Unit_ ") shall be converted into Earned
Shares (as defined in the Deferred Units award letter) at the rate of 0.5 of
the number of Deferred Units set forth in the related award letter and
otherwise in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Incentive
Plans and the award letters (if so converted under such plans and awards, each
Earned Share hereafter referred to as " _Vested Earned Share_ "). Each holder
of a Vested Earned Share under the Company Incentive Plans awarded (x) prior
to 2007 to any participant and (y) in 2007 to Non-Continuing Employees shall
be issued Company Common Stock for each Vested Earned Share and the underlying
shares of the Company Common Stock will be treated at the Effective Time the
same as, and shall have the same rights and be subject to the same conditions
as other shares of Company Common Stock not subject to any restrictions. For
Deferred Units granted in 2007 to holders other than Non-Continuing Employees
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, if the Parent assumes
the obligations of the Company under the award letter at the Effective Time,
Deferred Units shall be converted into, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, Company Restricted Stock at the rate of 0.5 of a share of Company
Restricted Stock per Deferred Unit and otherwise in accordance with the terms
of the applicable Company Incentive Plan and award letter, and such shares of
Company Restricted Stock shall be converted into a number of restricted
shares of Parent Company Stock equal to the product of the Exchange Ratio
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Restricted Stock so converted,
and the restrictions and conditions of such shares of restricted Parent
Company Stock shall be the same as those contained in the applicable Company
Incentive Plan and award letter related to the Company Restricted Stock so
converted. For Deferred Units granted in 2007 to holders other than Non-
Continuing Employees and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
if the Parent fails or otherwise refuses to assume the obligations of the
Company under the award letter at the Effective Time, such Deferred
Units shall be converted into, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
Company Restricted Stock at the rate of 0.5 of a share of Company Restricted
Stock per Deferred Unit and otherwise in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Company Incentive Plan and award letter, and each such share of
Company Restricted Stock shall be treated at the Effective Time the same as,
and shall have the same rights and be subject to the same conditions as other
shares of Company Restricted Stock pursuant to  _Section 2.4(c)(iv)_. The
holder of the Deferred Units may satisfy the applicable withholding Tax
obligations by returning to the Merger Sub or Parent a sufficient number of
shares of Company Common Stock equal to the value of such obligation.

(vi) _Dissenting Shares_. Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive any Merger Consideration unless the Dissenting
Stockholder holding particular Dissenting Shares has failed to perfect his,
her or its right to appraisal under the DGCL in respect of such shares or has
properly withdrawn his, her or its demand for appraisal in respect of such
shares. If such Dissenting Stockholder has so failed to perfect or has
withdrawn his, her or its rights to  



 

18  appraisal in respect of such shares, then such Dissenting Shares shall cease
to be Dissenting Shares and shall entitle such Dissenting Stockholder to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.4(c)(i)_ in
respect of such shares, and promptly following the occurrence of such event
and upon the surrender of the Company Certificate(s) representing such
Dissenting Shares, the Exchange Agent and the Surviving Company (as
applicable) shall deliver to the holder of such surrendered Company
Certificate(s) the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares. The Company
shall comply with those provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL which are
required to be performed by the Company prior to the Effective Time to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent. The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt
notice of any written demands for appraisal under the DGCL actually received
by the Company and (B) an opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL or offer to
settle or settle any such demands.

(vii) _Certain Adjustments_. If between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, whether or not permitted pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, the outstanding Parent Common Stock shall be changed into a
different number or type of securities by reason of any stock split,
combination, merger, consolidation, reorganization or other similar
transaction, or any distribution of shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
declared with a record date within such period, the Per Share
Stock Consideration and the Per Share Cash Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Company Common Stock, Company
Stock Options and Company Stock Awards with the same economic effect as was
contemplated by this Agreement prior to giving effect to such event.

Section 2.5 Election Procedures; Allocation of Merger Consideration.

(a) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Company Certificates theretofore representing shares of
Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Company
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) in such form as Parent shall specify and
as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Election Form_ ")
and pursuant to which each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock
as of the close of business on the Election Form Record Date may make an
election pursuant to this  _Section 2.5_, shall be mailed at the same time
as the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or at such other time as the Company and
Parent may agree (the date on which such mailing is commenced or such other
agreed date, the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of record of Company
Common Stock as of the close of business on the record date for notice of the
Company Special Meeting (the " _Election Form Record Date_"). Such Election
Form shall require each holder of record of a Company Certificate to specify
whether such holder of record is a citizen of the United States, within the
meaning of Section 2 of the Shipping Act of 1916, as amended (46 U.S.C.
Section 802), and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify.

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions), other than
any holder of Dissenting Shares, to specify (i) the number of shares of such
holders Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to
receive the Per Share Stock Consideration (" _Stock Election Shares_ "), (ii)
the number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to
which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration (" _Cash
Election Shares_ "), or (iii) that such holder makes no election with respect
to such holders Company Common Stock (" _Non-Election Shares_ "). Any Company
Common Stock with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an
effective, properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m., New York
time, on the 33rd day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date
as the Company and Parent shall agree) (the " _Election Deadline_ ") (other
than any shares of Company Common Stock that constitute Dissenting Shares as
of such time) shall also be  



 

19  deemed to be Non-Election Shares. Parent and the Company may agree to extend
such deadline to such other date as is agreed to by Parent and the Company,
and the Company and Parent shall make a public announcement of such new
Election Deadline, if any.

(c) Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably
be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders (or
beneficial owners) of Company Common Stock between the Election Form Record
Date and the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Election
Deadline, and the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information
reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

(d) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only
if accompanied by (i) one or more Company Certificates (or customary
affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such
Company Certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such Company
Certificates) representing all certificated shares of Company Common Stock
covered by such Election Form or (ii) in the case of shares in book-entry
form, any additional documents specified by the procedures set forth in the
Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials included in
the Election Form. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the Person
submitting such Election Form prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an
Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall become Non-
Election Shares and Parent shall cause the Company Certificates, if any,
representing Company Common Stock to be promptly returned without charge to
the Person submitting the Election Form upon written request to that effect
from the holder who submitted the Election Form, except to the extent (if any)
a subsequent election is properly made with respect to any or all of the
applicable shares of Company Common Stock. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable
discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been
properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election
Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such
matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any
defect in an Election Form.

(e) Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to allocate among the holders
of Company Common Stock with rights to receive Merger Consideration in
accordance with the Election Form as follows:

(i) _Cash Election Shares for more than Total Cash Amount_. If the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the Cash Election Shares by (y) the Per Share Cash
Consideration is greater than the Total Cash Amount, then:

(A) All Stock Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration,

(B) The Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash Election Shares,
pro rata to the holders of Cash Election Shares in accordance with
their respective numbers of Cash Election Shares (except as provided in the
last paragraph of this _Section 2.5(e)_), a sufficient number of shares ("
_Stock Designated Shares_ ") such that the aggregate cash amount that will
be paid in the Merger equals as closely as practicable the Total Cash Amount,
and all Stock Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Stock Consideration, and

(C) The Cash Election Shares that are not Stock Designated Shares will be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration. 



 

20 (ii) _Cash Election Shares for less than Total Cash Amount_. If the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the Cash Election Shares by (y) the Per Share
Cash Consideration is less than the Total Cash Amount, then:

(A) All Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration,

(B) The Exchange Agent shall then select first from among the Non-Election
Shares and then (if necessary) from among the Stock Election Shares, in each
case pro rata to the holders of Non-Election Shares or Stock Election Shares,
as the case may be, in accordance with their respective numbers of Non-
Election Shares or Stock Election Shares, as the case may be, a sufficient
number of shares (" _Cash Designated Shares_ ") such that the aggregate cash
amount that will be paid in the Merger equals as closely as practicable the
Total Cash Amount, and all Cash Designated Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, and

(C) The Stock Election Shares and the Non-Election Shares that are not Cash
Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration.

(iii) _Cash Election Shares equal to Total Cash Amount_. If the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the Cash Election Shares by (y) the Per Share
Cash Consideration is equal to the Total Cash Amount, then subparagraphs (i)
and (ii) above shall not apply and all Cash Election Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration and all Stock
Election Shares and Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Stock Consideration.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, for purposes of determining the allocations set forth
in this _Section 2.5_, Parent shall have the right to require, but not
the obligation to require (unless such requirement is necessary to satisfy
the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2(d)_ or _Section 6.3(e)_), that any
shares of Company Common Stock that constitute Dissenting Shares as of
the Election Deadline be treated as Cash Election Shares not subject to the
pro rata selection process contemplated by this _Section 2.5_, and, if Parent
so requires, then, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any Dissenting
Shares that receive the Merger Consideration shall be treated as Cash
Election Shares not subject to the pro rata selection process contemplated by
this _Section 2.5_.

(f) The pro rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall
consist of such equitable pro ration processes as shall be mutually determined
by Parent and the Company.

(g) _Excess Foreign Ownership_. The provisions of the Parent Charter Documents
and the Merger Sub Charter Documents shall, to the extent necessary, override
the provisions of this _Article 2_ to the extent necessary to eliminate any
Excess Foreign Ownership.

Section 2.6 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, (a) certificates representing shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)(i)_,  _Section
2.4(c)(iv)_ and _Section 2.4(c)(v)_ and delivered pursuant to _Section
2.6(b)_ and (b) cash or immediately available funds equal to the Total Cash
Amount. Such shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto (as provided in _Section 2.6(c)_) and such
funds, are referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions consistent with the terms of this
Agreement, shall deliver the Parent Common Stock and the cash portion of the
aggregate Merger Consideration to be issued or paid pursuant to _Section
2.4(c)(i)_,  



 

21   _Section 2.4(c)(iv)_ and _Section 2.4(c)(v)_ out of the Exchange Fund,
and the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose whatsoever. The
Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of
ownership with respect to the Parent Common Stock held by it from time to time
hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or
other distributions paid or distributed after the deposit of such Exchange
Fund with respect thereto for the account of Persons entitled thereto.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Company
Certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented shares
of Company Common Stock, a letter of transmittal to be used to effect the
exchange of such Company Certificate for the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Company
Certificate, along with instructions for using such letter of transmittal to
effect such exchange. The letter of transmittal (or the instructions thereto)
shall specify that delivery of any Company Certificate shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title thereto shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company
Certificate to the Exchange Agent. Such letter of transmittal shall require
each holder of record of a Company Certificate to specify whether such holder
of record is a citizen of the United States, within the meaning of Section 2
of the Shipping Act of 1916, as amended (46 U.S.C. Section 802), and shall be
in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify.

(ii) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Company Certificate for
cancellation, together with a duly completed and executed letter of
transmittal and any other required documents (including, in the case of any
Person constituting an "affiliate" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145(c)
and (d) under the Securities Act (" _Rule 145_ "), a written agreement from
such Person as described in _Section 5.9_, if not theretofore delivered to
Parent): (A) the holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a Parent Certificate representing the number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, and cash portion of the Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to  _Section
2.4(c)(i)_, _Section 2.4(c)(iv) _and _Section 2.4(c)(v)_, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as provided in _Section 2.6(e)_,
and any unpaid dividends and distributions that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)(i)_, _Section 2.4(c)(iv) _and _Section
2.4(c)(v) _(after giving effect to any required withholding of taxes); and (B)
the Company Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No
interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of
fractional shares or unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to
holders of Company Certificates.

(iii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common
Stock (along with any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any unpaid
dividends and distributions that such holder has the right to receive under
this Agreement) may be issued or paid to a transferee if the Company
Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to
the Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer, including such signature guarantees as Parent or the
Exchange Agent may request, and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer
taxes have been paid.

(iv) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.6(b)_, each
Company Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon surrender of a Company Certificate
and execution of such other documents as the Exchange Agent may require, the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Company Certificate as provided in _Section 2.4(c)(i)_,
_Section 2.4(c)(iv) _and  _Section 2.4(c)(v) _(along with any cash in lieu
of fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions).



 

22 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock declared or made after the
Effective Time with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Company Certificate. Subject to the effect of
applicable Law: (i) at the time of the surrender of a Company Certificate for
exchange in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.6_, there shall
be paid to the surrendering holder, without interest, the amount of dividends
or other distributions (having a record date after the Effective Time but on
or prior to surrender and a payment date on or prior to surrender) not
theretofore paid with respect to the number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock that such holder is entitled to receive (less the amount of any
withholding taxes that may be required with respect thereto); and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date and without duplicating any payment made under clause
(i) above, there shall be paid to the surrendering holder, without interest,
the amount of dividends or other distributions (having a record date after the
Effective Time but on or prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to
surrender) payable with respect to the number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock that such holder receives (less the amount of any withholding
taxes that may be required with respect thereto).

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration issued and paid upon the surrender for exchange of shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash
paid pursuant to  _Section 2.6(c)_ or _Section 2.6(e)_) shall be deemed to
have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be
no further registration of transfers of the shares of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, a Company Certificate is presented to the Surviving Company
for any reason, it shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
_Section 2.6_.

(e) _Treatment of Fractional Shares_. No Parent Certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the
Merger and, except as provided in this _Section 2.6(e)_, no dividend
or other distribution, stock split or interest shall relate to any such
fractional share, and such fractional share shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of
any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which a holder of Company
Common Stock would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all
Company Certificates delivered by or on behalf of such holder), such holder,
upon surrender of a Company Certificate as described in this _Section 2.6_,
shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying
(i) the Final Parent Stock Price by (ii) the fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder would in addition otherwise be entitled, in
which case Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, to any other
cash being provided to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_, the
amount of cash necessary to make such payments. The Parties acknowledge that
payment of cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock was not separately bargained for consideration but represents
merely a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the problems
that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund and cash
held by the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of this _Section 2.6
_that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company as of the
date that is twelve months following the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand. Thereafter, any former stockholders of the Company, other
than those exercising appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and
as provided in _Section 2.4(c)(vi)_, who have not theretofore complied with
the provisions of this _Section 2.6 _shall look only to Parent for payment of
their claim for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent
Common Stock (all without interest).



 

23 (g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company, the
Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to any public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by former holders of Company Common
Stock for a period of three years following the Effective Time (or such
earlier date immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental entity) shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free
and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors,
assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

(h) _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Company Certificates_. If any Company
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or
the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claims that may be
made against it with respect to such Company Certificate, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate
the Merger Consideration (along with any cash in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to _Section 2.6(e) _and any unpaid dividends and distributions
pursuant to _Section 2.6(c)_) deliverable with respect thereto pursuant to
this Agreement.

Section 2.7 Closing. The Closing shall take place on the Closing Date at such
time and place as is agreed upon by Parent and the Company. 

Section 2.8 Effective Time of the Merger. The Merger shall become effective
(the " _Effective Time_ ") immediately when the Certificate of Merger is
accepted for filing by the Secretary of State of Delaware, or at such time
thereafter as is provided in the Certificate of Merger. As soon as practicable
after the Closing, the Certificate of Merger shall be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, and the Effective Time shall
occur.

Section 2.9 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties shall use all reasonable
efforts to take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order
to effectuate the Merger under the DGCL and DLLCA as promptly as commercially
practicable. In addition, the Parties agree to execute and deliver any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
and to vest the Surviving Company with full right, title and possession to all
assets, real estate and other property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of either of Merger Sub or the Company, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Company are fully authorized, in the name of the
Surviving Company or otherwise to take, and shall take, all such lawful and
necessary action.

 

Section 2.10 Withholding. Each of Parent, the Surviving Company and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of Company Common Stock such amounts as required under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of
such payment. Any such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.



 

24 Article 3

Representations and Warranties of the Company

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

Section 3.1 Company Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority. The Company
is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of the State of Delaware. The Company is duly qualified to
conduct business and is in good standing (to the extent such concept exists in
the relevant jurisdiction) in each jurisdiction in which the ownership,
operation or lease of its property or the nature of the Companys business
requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions in which such failure to
be so qualified or to be in good standing individually or in the aggregate
does not constitute and is not reasonably likely to constitute a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its
business as currently conducted. The Company has delivered to Parent true,
accurate and complete copies of the Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (including any and all Certificates of Designations) and bylaws
of the Company, each as amended to date (the " _Company Charter Documents_
"), and each Company Charter Document is in full force and effect, has not
been amended or modified and has not been terminated, superseded or revoked.
The Company is not in violation of its Company Charter Documents.

Section 3.2 Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements.

 

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has the requisite corporate power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and
to carry on its business as it is currently being conducted, except (as to
foreign Company Subsidiaries only) as would have an immaterial effect on the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and the Company has the
requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and all other agreements, instruments, certificates and documents contemplated
hereunder (collectively, the " _Related Documents_ ") to which it is a party,
to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the
Merger and all other transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Related
Documents and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereunder and thereunder have been duly authorized by all
requisite corporate action on behalf of the Company, and no other corporate
proceedings by the Company are necessary to authorize the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Related Documents or to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereunder or under the Related
Documents except for the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the
Companys stockholders and the filing of the Certificate of Merger pursuant
to Delaware Law and the Governmental Authority application and approvals
described in _Section 5.8_.

(b) Under Delaware Law, the Required Company Vote is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of Equity Interests of the Company necessary to
approve and adopt this Agreement, approve the Merger and consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) This Agreement and each of the Related Documents to which the Company is
a party has been duly executed by the Company and constitute the valid and
legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws relating to or affecting
the rights and remedies of creditors generally and to general principles of
equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law).
This Agreement and each Related Document to which the Company is a party has
been duly executed or will be duly executed and delivered by the Company by
duly authorized officers of the Company. The Company has taken all action
necessary to render the restrictions set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL
inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.



 

25 Section 3.3 Capitalization.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 500,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock, and (ii) 50,000,000 shares of Company
Preferred Stock. As of the close of business on March 15, 2007, there were (a)
57,772,039 issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, (b) no
issued shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company in its
treasury, and (c) no issued or outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock.
The stockholders of the Company previously approved a Long-Term Incentive Plan
(the " _Company 2004 Plan_ ") and in May 2005 approved of the 2005 Long-
Term Incentive Plan (the " _Company 2005 Plan_ ", together with the Company
2004 Plan, the " _Company Incentive Plans_ "). Upon stockholder approval of
the Company 2005 Plan, no further awards to acquire Equity Interests in
the Company were granted under the Company 2004 Plan. As of March 15, 2007,
361,824 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to
outstanding Company Stock Options under the Company 2004 Plan and 352,750
shares of Company Common Stock are reserved for issuance pursuant to

duly organized or constituted, validly existing under the Laws of
its jurisdiction of incorporation, organization or formation. The Companys
Subsidiaries have all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate
and lease their respective properties and to carry on their respective
business as currently conducted. The Companys Subsidiaries are each duly
qualified to conduct business and are each in good standing (to the extent
such concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction) in each jurisdiction in
which the ownership, operation or lease of such Subsidiarys property or the
nature of such Subsidiarys business requires such qualification, except for
jurisdictions in which such failure to be so qualified or to be in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, does not constitute and would not
be reasonably likely to constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect. All of
the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other Equity Interests in, each
of the Companys Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company free
and clear of all Liens, except for directors qualifying shares and Liens
granted under the agreements identified in clauses (a) or (b) of the
definition of Company Credit Agreements.

(b) Exhibit 21.1 to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2006 includes all of the Companys Subsidiaries. The
Companys U.S. Subsidiaries are not in violation of their respective Company
Subsidiary Charter Documents, and the Companys non-U.S. Subsidiaries are not
in material violation of their respective Company Subsidiary Charter
Documents.

Section 3.5 Compliance with Laws; Permits. Except for such matters as,
individually or in the aggregate, do not or are not reasonably likely to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect, and except for (i) matters relating to
Taxes, which are treated exclusively in _Section 3.10_, and (ii) matters
arising under Environmental Health and Safety Laws which are treated
exclusively in _Section 3.13_:

certifications, variations, exemptions, Orders, franchises, registrations,
filings, approvals, authorizations or other required grant of operating
authority required by any Governmental Authority necessary for the conduct of
their respective businesses (the " _Company Permits_ "). All Company Permits
are in full force and effect and there exists no default thereunder or breach
thereof, and the Company has no notice or knowledge that such Company Permits
will not be renewed in the ordinary course after the Effective Time. No
Governmental Authority has given, or to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened to give, notice of any action to terminate, cancel or reform any
Company Permits.

(c) Each drilling rig or other vessel owned by the Company or a Subsidiary of
the Company which is subject to classification is in class according to
the rules and regulations of the applicable classifying body and is duly and
lawfully documented under the Laws of its flag jurisdiction.

(d) The Company and each Subsidiary of the Company possess all Company
Permits required for the present ownership or lease, as the case may be, and
operation of all the Company Owned Real Property and Company Leased Real
Property (together, the " _Company Real Property_ ") except where the failure
to possess any of the same, individually or in the aggregate, has not caused,
and is not reasonably likely to cause, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
There exists no material default or breach with respect to, and no Person,
including any Governmental Authority, has taken or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened to take, any action to terminate, cancel or reform any
such Company Permit pertaining to the Company Real Property.

Related Documents, the performance of the Companys obligations hereunder

other transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder in accordance with

obligations of third parties under or result in the termination or in a right
of termination or cancellation of, or give rise to a right of purchase under,
or accelerate the performance required by, any Company Material Contract
or other Contract or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the

cases of clauses (ii) through (iii), any such violations, conflicts, breaches,
defaults, impairments, alterations, terminations, cancellations, purchase
rights, accelerations, Liens, voidings or detriments which individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

(b) Neither the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement or
any Related Document nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof
will require any consent, approval or authorization of, or filing or
registration with, any Governmental Authority, other than (i) the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and appropriate
documents required to be filed as a result of the Merger with the relevant
Governmental Authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which
Company or any Company Subsidiary is qualified to conduct business, (ii) the
filing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus with the SEC in accordance with the

time frame in which the Merger would otherwise be consummated.



 

28 Section 3.7 SEC Documents.

(a) The Company has filed with the SEC all documents required to be so filed
by it since January 1, 2006 pursuant to Sections 13(a), 14(a) and 15(d) of
the Exchange Act, and has made available to Parent each registration
statement, report, proxy statement or information statement (other than
preliminary materials) it has so filed, each in the form (including exhibits
and any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC (collectively, the " _Company
Reports_ "). As of its respective date, each Company Report complied in all
material respects in accordance with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act, SOX and the rules and regulations thereunder and did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading except for such statements, if any, as have been modified by
subsequent filings with the SEC prior to the date hereof. Each of the
consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the
Company Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated statements
of operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders equity included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including any related
notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the results of
operations, cash flows or changes in stockholders equity, as the case may
be, of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein, and
in each case such consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of
operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders equity, each including
the notes and schedules thereto (" _Company Financial Statements_ ") (a)
complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC, and (b) was prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted in
the Company Financial Statements or as permitted by Form 10-Q or Form 8-K.
Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance sheet of
the Company and its Subsidiaries included in the Company Reports filed before
Closing, including all notes thereto, as of the date of such balance sheet,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise) that would be required to be reflected on, or reserved against in,
a balance sheet of the Company or in the notes thereto prepared in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied, other than (i) in the case of unaudited
financial statements, normal year-end audit adjustments, and (ii) liabilities
or obligations which have not caused and are not reasonably likely to cause,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Neither the Company nor its independent auditors have identified any
"material weaknesses" in the Companys or its Subsidiaries internal controls
as contemplated under Section 404 of SOX. The Company has not entered into or
modified any loans or arrangements with its officers and directors in
violation of Section 402 of SOX. 

Section 3.8 Litigation. Except as described in the Company Reports, there is
no litigation, arbitration, mediation, action, suit, claim, proceeding or
investigation, whether legal or administrative, pending against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets,
properties or operations, at Law or in equity, before or by any Governmental
Authority or any Order of any Governmental Authority that, individually or in
the aggregate and taking into consideration the aggregate amounts reserved in
the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006, for any such
matters, is reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.9 Absence of Certain Changes. From December 31, 2006 to the date of
this Agreement, except as described in the Company Reports, there has not been
(i) any event or occurrence that has caused or is reasonably likely to cause
a Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) any material change by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, when taken as a whole, in any of its accounting  



 

29  methods, principles or practices or any of its tax methods, practices or
elections, (iii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend
or distribution in respect of any capital stock or other Equity Interest of
the Company or any redemption, purchase or other acquisition of any of its
Equity Interests, or (iv) except as disclosed in the Form 8-K filed by the
Company on March 2, 2007 or in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice, any increase in or establishment of any bonus, insurance,
severance, deferred compensation, pension, retirement, profit sharing, stock
option, stock purchase or other employee benefit plan.

Company Subsidiary have timely paid (or the Company has paid on each such
Company Subsidiarys behalf) all Taxes due and owing, and, in accordance with
GAAP, the most recent Company Financial Statements contained in the Company
Reports reflect a reserve (including a reserve or payable under the TSA but
excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes) for all Taxes payable by the Company

through the date of such Company Financial Statements, in each case except as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(ii) No Tax Return of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is under audit or
examination by any Tax Authority, and no written notice or, to the knowledge
of the Company, unwritten notice of such an audit or examination has been
received by the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Each material assessed
deficiency resulting from any audit or examination relating to Taxes by any
Tax Authority has been timely paid and there is no assessed deficiency,
refund litigation, proposed adjustment or matter in controversy with respect
to any Taxes due and owing by the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(iii) There is no agreement or other document extending, or having the effect
of extending, the period of assessment or collection of any material
Taxes and no power of attorney with respect to any such Taxes has been
executed or filed with any Tax Authority by or on behalf of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary.

(iv) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, no Liens for Taxes exist
with respect to any assets or properties of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, except for statutory liens for Taxes not yet due.

(v) Except for the TSA and as, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any Tax sharing

with respect to Taxes (including any advance pricing agreement, closing
agreement or other agreement relating to Taxes with any Tax Authority), other
than any such agreements (i) with customers, vendors, lessors or similar
persons entered into in the ordinary course of business and (ii) among the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries.



 

30 (vi) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and each
Company Subsidiary have complied with all applicable Laws relating to the

attributable to income that accrued in a prior Taxable period but was not

of accounting, the long-term contract method of accounting, the cash method
of accounting or Section 481 of the Code or comparable provisions of state,
local or foreign Tax Law.

(ix) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has participated in any
"listed transaction" as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4.

has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in
connection with a distribution described in Section 355 of the Code.

(b)  _Reorganization_. None of the Acquired Companies knows of any fact,
agreement, plan, or other circumstance, or has taken any action or has failed
to take any action, that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, and no facts exist that would cause the Merger to fail to so qualify.

the Company Benefit Plans comply in all material respects with the
requirements of ERISA and the Code or with the Laws and regulations of any
applicable jurisdiction, and except as set forth in Section 3.11 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, any Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Services (the "IRS") and such letter has not been
revoked; all required amendments since the issuance of such favorable
determination letter from the IRS have been made and no amendments have been
made which could reasonably be expected to result in the disqualification of
any of such Company Benefit Plans; the Company Benefit Plans have been
maintained and operated in material compliance with their terms; to the
Companys knowledge, there are no breaches of fiduciary duty in connection
with the Company Benefit Plans for which the Company could be liable; there
are no pending or, to the  



 

31  Companys knowledge, threatened claims against or otherwise involving any
Company Benefit Plan that could have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and
no suit, action or other litigation (excluding claims for benefits incurred

Section 3(37) of ERISA.

for employees or former employees of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company for periods extending beyond their retirement or other termination of
service other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable Law, (ii) death
benefits under any "pension plan" or benefits the full cost of which is borne
by the current or former employee (or his beneficiary).

(e) All accrued material obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
whether arising by operation of Law, Contract, or past custom, for
compensation and benefits, including, but not limited to, bonuses and accrued
vacation, and benefits under Company Benefit Plans, have been paid or adequate
accruals for such obligations are reflected on the Company Financial
Statements as of the date thereof. 

(f) _Section 3.11_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth an accurate
and complete list of each Company Benefit Plan (and the particular
circumstances described herein relating to such Company Benefit Plan) under
which the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby could (either alone or in conjunction with
any other event, such as termination of employment), result in, cause the
accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value
of, any payment or benefit to any employee, officer or director of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. As to each Company Benefit Plan maintained by the
Acquired Companies, the Company or applicable Subsidiary as the case may be,

liability to any Person except with respect to benefits accrued in the
ordinary course prior to the date of such amendment or termination.

, _however_ , that the Company may in its sole discretion and without
Parents prior written consent amend or adopt any arrangement to cause an
arrangement existing on the date hereof to comply with, or be exempt from,
Section 409A of the Code if such amendment or arrangement does not cause or
entail any cost or expense to the Company (other than reasonable and necessary
fees and expenses of advisors in connection therewith).

(k) No Company Benefit Plan that is not subject to ERISA has any material
liabilities thereunder which are not otherwise fully funded, if applicable, or
properly accrued and reflected under the Company Financial Statements as of

corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the State of Delaware. Merger Sub is a limited liability company duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware. The Parent and Merger Sub are duly qualified to conduct business
and are in good standing (to the extent such concept exists in the relevant
jurisdiction) in each jurisdiction in which the ownership, operation or lease
of their respective properties or the nature of their respective business
requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions in which such failure to
be so qualified or to be in good standing does not constitute and is not
reasonably likely to constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and
Merger Sub have all requisite corporate or limited liability power and
authority to own, operate and lease their properties and to carry on their
respective business as currently conducted. Parent has delivered true,
accurate and complete copies of the (a) Certificate of Incorporation
(including any and all Certificates of Designations) and bylaws of the Parent,
each as amended to date (the " _Parent Charter Documents_ "), and (b) the
Certificate of Formation of Merger Sub and the limited liability company

other corporate proceedings by Parent and Merger Sub or are necessary to
authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Related
Documents or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated

of this Agreement by Parents stockholders, the filing of the Certificate of
Merger pursuant to Delaware Law and the Governmental Authority applications
and approvals described in _Section 5.8_.



 

38 (b) Under Delaware Law, the Required Parent Vote is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of Equity Interests of Parent necessary to
approve and adopt this Agreement, approve the Merger and consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

party has been duly executed by Parent and constitutes the valid and legally
binding obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent in accordance with
its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other Laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of
creditors generally and to general principles of equity (regardless of
whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law). This Agreement and
each Related Document to which Parent and/or Merger Sub is a party has been

39  Subsidiaries are each duly qualified to conduct business and are each in
good standing (to the extent such concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction)
in each jurisdiction in which the ownership, operation or lease of such
Subsidiarys property or the nature of such Subsidiarys business requires
such qualification, except for jurisdictions in which such failure to be so
qualified or to be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, does
not constitute and would not be reasonably likely to constitute a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or
other Equity Interests in, each of Parents Subsidiaries are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent free and clear of all Liens except for directors

applied, other than (i) in the case of unaudited financial statements, normal
year-end audit adjustments, and (ii) liabilities or obligations which have
not caused and are not reasonably likely to cause, individually or in the

or operations, at Law or in equity, before or by any Governmental Authority
or any Order of any Governmental Authority that, individually or in the

January 17, 2007 or in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, any increase in or establishment of any bonus, insurance, severance,

stock purchase or other employee benefit plan.

reasonable efforts to cause any such destruction to be certified in writing by
such Person to the Company or Parent) all confidential information heretofore
furnished by the Acquired Companies or Parent Companies or any of their
legal, financial or other representatives to such Person or any of its or
their legal, financial or other representatives in accordance with the terms
of the confidentiality agreement with such Person.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to
obtaining the Required Company Vote or the Required Parent Vote, as the case
may be, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or Parent, or
their respective Boards of Directors from:

(i) after the date of this Agreement, engaging in discussions or negotiations
with, or furnishing or disclosing any information or data relating to, the
Acquired Companies or the Parent Companies (as the case may be) or, in
response to a request therefor, giving access to the properties, assets or
the books and records of the Acquired Companies or the Parent Companies (as
the case may be) to, any Person who has made a bona fide written and
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof if such Person has
submitted an Acquisition Proposal which did not result from a violation by the
Acquired Companies or the Parent Companies (as the case may be) of this
_Section 5.4 _and the Board of Directors of the Company or Parent (as the
case may be) determines based on such matters as it deems relevant, that such
Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal,
but only so long as, prior to furnishing any non-public information
regarding the Acquired Companies or the Parent Companies (as the case may be)
to such Person or engaging in any discussions or negotiations with such Third
Party, (x) such Board of Directors acting in good faith has determined, (A)
after consultation with its financial advisors, that such Acquisition
Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, (B) after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations
to the stockholders of the Company or Parent (as the case may be) under
applicable Law and (C) that such Third Party has the financial and legal
capacity to consummate such Acquisition Proposal and (y) the Company or
Parent (as the case may be) (i) enters into a confidentiality agreement with
such Third Party with use and disclosure limitations, "standstill" provisions
and other material terms that are no more favorable to such Person than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement between the Company and Parent and

Parent (as the case may be)), the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the Company Board of Directors or the Parent Board
of Directors or any committee thereof (as the case may be) of this Agreement,
the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby (the  



 

56  actions referred to in this clause (A) being collectively referred to herein
as " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ " or " _Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change_ " as applicable), or (B) recommending, adopting or
approving, or proposing publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Acquired Companies or the Parent
Companies (the actions referred to in this clause (B) being collectively
referred to as " _Company Acquisition Proposal Recommendation_ " or " _Parent
Acquisition Proposal Recommendation_ ," as applicable), or (C) entering into
any agreement, including any agreement in principle, letter of intent or
understanding, acquisition or merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture, partnership agreement or similar agreement, arrangement
or understanding, constituting or related to (or intended to or which could
reasonably be expected to lead to) an Acquisition Proposal (other than a
Confidentiality Agreement contemplated by _Section 5.4(c)(i)_) (each an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ ") but only so long as (x) the Board of Directors of
the Company or Parent (as the case may be), acting in good faith has
determined (A) in the case of a Company Acquisition Proposal Recommendation or
Parent Acquisition Proposal Recommendation or entry into an Acquisition
Agreement, as applicable, and after consultation with its financial advisors,
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (B) after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations
to the stockholders of the Company or Parent (as the case may be) under
applicable Law, and (y) in cases involving (1) the making of a Company
Acquisition Proposal Recommendation or a Parent Acquisition Proposal
Recommendation or (2) the entry into an Acquisition Agreement, the Company or
Parent (as the case may be) concurrently terminates this Agreement
pursuant to, and after complying with the provisions of _Section 5.4(e) _and
_Article 7_. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the taking of any action
inconsistent with any of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.4
_by any Acquired Company shall be deemed a breach of this _Section 5.4 _by
the Company. Parent acknowledges and agrees that the taking of any action
inconsistent with any of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.4 _by
any Parent Company shall be deemed a breach of this _Section 5.4 _by Parent.

information from a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal involving the Company, or any Parent Company or Parent
Representative receives a request for information from a Person who has
made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal involving the
Parent Companies, and the Company or Parent (as the case may be) is permitted
to provide such Person with information pursuant to this _Section 5.4_, the
Company or Parent (as the case may be) will provide to the other party a copy
of the confidentiality agreement with such Person promptly upon its execution
and provide to the other party a list of, and copies of, all information
provided to such Person promptly as practicable after its delivery to such
Person and promptly provide the other party with access to all information to
which such Person was provided access, in each case only to the extent not
previously provided to the other party. The Company or Parent (as the case
may be) shall promptly provide notice to the other party orally and in writing
of receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or that
could lead to an Acquisition Proposal (but in no event more than twenty-four
hours after the receipt thereof), including the identity of the Person or
group engaging in such discussions or negotiations, requesting such
information or making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of any Acquisition Proposal and copies of all documentation and
material correspondence related to such Acquisition Proposal. The Company or
Parent (as the case may be) shall promptly provide the other party with any
written changes to the Acquisition Proposal and promptly advise the other
party of material changes in the status of any Acquisition Proposal (including
proposed changes to the status) and shall promptly inform the other party of
any change in any of the price, form of consideration, timing of payment
thereof or any other material terms. The Company or Parent (as the case may
be) shall promptly advise the other party of the substance of any oral
communications concerning material terms of any Acquisition Proposal. The
Company or Parent (as the case may be) shall immediately provide the other

correspondence or other material written items sent or provided to the Company
or Parent (as the case may be) from any Third Party in  



 

57  connection with any Acquisition Proposal or sent or provided by the Company
to any Third Party in connection with any Acquisition Proposal. Any

of the Company or Parent (as the case may be) shall not (i) make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse Recommendation Change (as the
case may be), (ii) make a Company Acquisition Proposal Recommendation or
Parent Acquisition Proposal Recommendation or (iii) enter into any Acquisition
Agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal, unless the Company or Parent
(as the case may be) complies with each of the following:

(i) The terms of _Section 5.4(d) _and _Section 5.4(c)(ii)_; and

(ii) Promptly upon determination by the Board of Directors of the Company or
Parent (as the case may be) that an Acquisition Proposal, if any, constitutes
a Superior Proposal, the Company or Parent (as the case may be) shall
immediately notify the other party thereof, telephonically and in writing, and
such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person making
such Superior Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change may or may not involve an Acquisition Proposal. The
Board of Directors written notice of receipt of a Superior Proposal must
state if the Board of Directors intends to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse Recommendation Change (as the
case may be) or enter into an Acquisition Agreement involving such Superior
Proposal, and the other party shall have three Business Days from receipt of
such written notice to submit an offer to engage in an alternative transaction
or to modify the terms of this Agreement (a " _Revised Offer_ "). During such
three Business Day period, the Company or Parent (as the case may be) shall
negotiate in good faith exclusively with the other party to enable the other
party to submit a Revised Offer; and

(iii) Only in cases involving (x) the making of a Company Acquisition Proposal
Recommendation or a Parent Acquisition Proposal Recommendation or (y) the
entering into an Acquisition Agreement, the Company or Parent (as the case may
be) concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to, and after complying
with all of the provisions of, _Article 7_. 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4 _shall prohibit the Company or
Parent or their respective Boards of Directors from taking and disclosing to
the stockholders of the Company or Parent (as the case may be) a position with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Acquired Companies or
the Parent Companies pursuant to Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under
the Exchange Act or from making any similar disclosure, in either case to the
extent required by applicable Law.

Closing Date, and one bring-down letter dated on the Closing Date,
each addressed to the Company and customary in scope and substance for
letters delivered by independent auditors in connection with public offerings.

Section 5.7 NASDAQ Listing. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall use all
reasonable efforts to authorize for listing on the NASDAQ the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable and required to be reserved for issuance in connection
with the Merger, subject to official notice of issuance.



 

60 Section 5.8 Additional Arrangements.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the Company
and Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all action and shall do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, appropriate or desirable under any
applicable Law (including the HSR Act) or under applicable Contracts so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably practicable, including using
its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary waivers, consents and
approvals, removing all impediments, and effecting all Parent Regulatory
Filings and Company Regulatory Filings (the " _Regulatory Filings_ "). Parent
and the Company each will cause all documents it is responsible for filing
with any Governmental Authority under this _Section 5.8 _to comply with all
applicable Laws.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish the other party with such
information and reasonable assistance as such other party and its respective
affiliates may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of any
Regulatory Filings to any Governmental Authorities; _provided, however_ , that
if the provisions of the HSR Act would prevent a party from disclosing such
information to the other party, then such information may be disclosed to
such partys counsel.

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all
action or shall do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, appropriate or
desirable to cause the covenants and conditions applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby to be performed or satisfied as soon as practicable,
including responding promptly to requests for additional information made by
the DOJ or the FTC, and to cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act to
terminate or expire at the earliest possible date after the date of filing.

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, Order
or judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing. Furthermore,
if any Governmental Authority shall have issued any Order, decree, ruling or
injunction, or taken any other action that would have the effect of
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting, delaying or preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company and
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have such Order, decree,
ruling or injunction or other action declared ineffective as soon as
practicable.

(e) Parent and the Company shall promptly notify each other of any
communication concerning this Agreement or the Merger from any Governmental
Authority and, subject to applicable Law, permit the other party to review in
advance any proposed communication to any Governmental Authority concerning
this Agreement or the Merger. In addition, Parent and Company shall not agree
to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or another inquiry
concerning this Agreement or the Merger, or enter into any
agreements, including, without limitation, extending any antitrust waiting
periods, unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Parent and the Company shall
furnish counsel to the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings
and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between
them and their affiliates and their respective representatives on the one
hand, and any Governmental Authorities or members of their respective staffs
on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as provided in _Section 5.1
_and _5.2_ , nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed so as to
require Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, without its written consent, to sell, license,
dispose of, or hold separate, or to operate in any specified manner, any
assets or businesses of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving
Company (or to require Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or  



 

61  any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to agree to any of the
foregoing). The obligations of each party under this _Section 5.8 _to
use reasonable best efforts with respect to antitrust matters shall be
limited to compliance with the reporting provisions of the HSR Act and with
its obligations under this _Section 5.8_. In connection with its obligations
under this  _Section 5.8_, the Company shall not, without Parents prior
written consent, commit to any divestitures, licenses, hold separate
arrangements or similar matters, including covenants affecting business
operating practices (or allow its Subsidiaries to commit to any divestitures,
licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar matters) in connection with
the transactions contemplated under this Agreement.

Section 5.9 Agreements of Affiliates. As promptly as practicable after the
date hereof, the Company shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Parent a
list identifying all Persons who, at the time of the Company Meeting, may be
deemed to be "affiliates" of the Company as that term is used in paragraphs
(c) and (d) of Rule 145. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each Person who is identified as an affiliate of the Company
under Rule 145 in such list to execute and deliver to Parent, on or prior to
the Closing Date, a written agreement, in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit 5.9_. Parent shall give stop transfer instructions to its transfer
agent with respect to any Company Common Stock received pursuant to the Merger
by any stockholder of the Company who may reasonably be deemed to be an
affiliate of the Company for purposes of Rule 145, and Parent shall cause the
transfer agent to place legends on the Parent Certificates representing any
Parent Common Stock to be issued to such Persons in the Merger, irrespective
of whether or not such Persons sign such agreements, which legends in
substance shall provide that the shares were issued in a transaction to which
Rule 145 applies and may only be transferred (i) in conformity with Rule 145,
or (ii) in accordance with a written opinion of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Parent that such transfer is exempt from registration under
the Securities Act.

Section 5.10 Section 16\. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company, and their respective Boards of Directors, shall adopt resolutions
consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC and take any other
actions as may be required to the extent permitted under applicable Law to
cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent
Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common
Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby by each individual
who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act to be exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.11 Public Announcements.

(a) On the date this Agreement is executed, Parent and the Company shall issue
a joint press release with respect to the execution hereof and
the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as may be required by applicable
Law, Order or any listing agreement with or rule of any regulatory body,
national securities exchange or association, Parent and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release, making any other
public statement or scheduling any press conference or conference call with
investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Before any Merger Communication of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective "participants" (as defined in Rule 165 of the Securities Act or
Item 4 of Schedule 14a of the Exchange Act) is (i) disseminated to any
investor, analyst, member of the media, employee, client, customer or other
third-party or otherwise made accessible on the website of Parent, the Company
or any such participant, as applicable (whether in written, video or oral
form via webcast, hyperlink or otherwise), or (ii) utilized by any executive
officer, key employee or advisor of Parent, the Company or any such
participant, as applicable, as a script in discussions or meetings with any
third parties, Parent or  



 

62  the Company, as the case may be, shall (or shall cause any such participant
to) cooperate in good faith with respect to any such Merger Communication
for purposes of, among other things, determining whether that communication
(x) is required to be filed under Rules 165 and 425 of the Exchange Act or (y)
constitutes "soliciting material" that is required to be filed by
Rule 14a-6(b) or Rule 14a-12(b) of the Exchange Act, as applicable. Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, shall (or shall cause any such
participant to) give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by the other such party or parties and their counsel on any such Merger
Communication. For purposes of the foregoing, the term " _Merger
Communication_ " shall mean, with respect to any Person, any document or other
written communication prepared by or behalf of that Person, or any document
or other material or information posted or made accessible on the website of
that Person (whether in written, video or oral form via webcast, hyperlink or
otherwise), that is related to any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and, if reviewed by a relevant stockholder, could reasonably be
deemed to constitute either (x) an offer to sell such stock or a solicitation
of any offer to buy the Parent Common Stock or (y) a "solicitation" of
"proxies" (in each case, as defined in Rule 14a-1 of the Exchange Act) in
favor of the Merger.

Section 5.12 Notification of Certain Matters.

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub of any of
the following: (i) any representation or warranty contained in _Article 3_
being untrue or inaccurate when made, (ii) the occurrence of any event or
development that would cause (or could reasonably be expected to cause)
any representation or warranty contained in _Article 3_ to be untrue or
inaccurate on or before the Closing Date, or (iii) any failure of the Company
to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder.

(b) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of any of the following:
(i) any representation or warranty contained in _Article 4_ being untrue or
inaccurate when made, (ii) the occurrence of any event or development that
would cause (or could reasonably be expected to cause) any representation or
warranty contained in  _Article 4_ to be untrue or inaccurate at any time on
or before the Closing Date, or (iii) any failure of Parent to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder. 

Section 5.13 Payment of Expenses. Except as provided in _Section 7.3_, each
Party shall pay its own expenses incident to preparing for, entering into and
carrying out this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether or not the Merger is consummated, except that
Parent and the Company shall equally share the following: (i) all fees and
expenses, other than attorneys, accountants, financial advisers and
consultants fees and expenses which shall be paid by the party incurring
same, incurred in relation to the printing and filing with the SEC of the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, including preliminary materials related thereto
and the Registration Statement, including financial statements and exhibits,
and any amendments and supplements thereto, and (ii) the filing fees for
the Registration Statement and the Notification and Report Forms filed with
the FTC and DOJ under the HSR Act.

Section 5.14 Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the
Surviving Company, subject to applicable Law, to comply with the obligations
of the Company under indemnification agreements between the Company and its
directors and officers in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and
described in the Company Disclosure Letter. The limited liability company
agreement of the Surviving Company shall contain provisions with respect to
indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as
those contained in the certificate of  



 

63  incorporation and bylaws of the Company, any Company Material Contract,
employment agreement, indemnification agreement or Company Benefit Plan, as in
effect on the date hereof, in each case that is described in the Company
Disclosure Letter or as disclosed in the Company Reports filed prior to the
date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees or agents of
the Company, unless such modification is required by applicable Law. In the
event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six-year period,
all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall
continue until final disposition of any and all such claims. 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and Surviving Company, shall,
for a period of six years after the Effective Time, jointly and severally,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any
time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective
Time, an officer, director, employee controlling stockholder or
agent (including a trustee or fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan) of any of
the Acquired Companies (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") to the
fullest extent permitted by Law against all losses, expenses (including
reasonable outside attorneys fees), claims, damages, fines, costs,
liabilities or amounts that are paid in settlement with the approval of the
indemnifying party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld)
resulting from, or otherwise in connection with, any threatened or actual
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (a " _Claim_ "), based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, the fact that the
Indemnified Party (or the Person controlled by the Indemnified Party) is or
was a director, officer, employee, controlling stockholder or agent (including
a trustee or fiduciary of any Company Benefit Plan) and pertaining to any
matter existing or arising out of actions or omissions or alleged actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including any Claim
arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby),
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, and
shall, jointly and severally, pay any expenses, as incurred, in advance of the
final disposition of any such action or proceeding to each Indemnified Party
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. Each Indemnified Party
will be entitled to receive such advances from Parent or the Surviving
Company within ten Business Days of receipt by Parent or the Surviving Company
from the Indemnified Party of a request therefore; _provided_ , that any
Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to
the extent required by Law, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification. Without
limiting the foregoing, in the event any such Claim is brought against any
Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the Effective Time): (i)
Parent shall have the right to control the defense of such matter with
Parents regularly engaged legal counsel or other counsel selected by Parent
and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and Parent shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel; and (ii) the Indemnified Party
will cooperate with Parent, at Parents expense, in the defense of any
such matter. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any proceeding (and in
which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder),
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Claim
or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents. In the event of any Claim, any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification will promptly notify
Parent thereof ( _provided_ , that failure to so notify Parent will not affect
the obligations of Parent except to the extent that Parent shall have been
prejudiced as a result of such failure) and shall deliver to Parent the
undertaking contemplated by the applicable provisions of the DGCL, but without
any requirement for the posting of a bond. Without limiting the foregoing, in
the event any such Claim is brought against any of the Indemnified Parties,
such Indemnified Party may retain only one law firm (plus one local counsel,
if necessary) to represent all such Indemnified Parties with respect to each
such matter unless the use of counsel chosen to represent the Indemnified
Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, or the
representation of all of the Indemnified Parties by the same counsel would be
inappropriate due to actual differing interests between them, in which case
such additional counsel as may  



 

64  be required (as shall be reasonably determined by the Indemnified Parties
and Parent) may be retained by the Indemnified Parties at the cost and expense
of Parent and Parent shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for such Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained in this _Section 5.14 _shall be deemed to grant any right to any
Indemnified Party which is not permitted to be granted to an officer,
director, employee, controlling stockholder or agent of the Company under
Delaware Law, nor shall Parent or Surviving Company be required to indemnify
any of the Indemnified Parties to a greater extent that the Company would be
required to as of the date hereof pursuant to its present indemnification
agreements with such Indemnified Parties.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to maintain in effect for not less than six years from the Effective
Time directors and officers liability insurance policies covering those
persons who are covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policy as of the Effective Time with respect to Claims arising from
facts or events that occurred prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued by an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier, of at least the same coverage containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous than the Companys current policy;
(ii) such substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses in coverage with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; and (iii) Parent
shall not be required to pay an annual premium in excess of 250% of the last
annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof. In the event that
the annual premium for such insurance exceeds such maximum amount,
Parent shall purchase as much coverage per policy year as reasonably
obtainable for such maximum amount.

(d) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and
legal representatives. The indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or
otherwise.

(e) In the event that the Surviving Company or Parent, or any of their
respective successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed
to the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.14_.

Section 5.15 Employee Matters.

(a) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans, policies or
arrangements of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company
Employees after the Effective Time (the " _Post-Merger Plans_ "), Parent
will, or will cause its Subsidiaries to, give Company Employees full credit
for their years of service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary to the
same extent recognized by the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately
prior the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit
accrual (excluding benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plans)
under any such employee benefit plans, policy or arrangements maintained by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. The value of benefits provided under the
Post-Merger Plans along with all other compensation provided to Company
Employees taken as a whole shall be substantially similar to the value of the
benefits and compensation taken as a whole provided under the Parent Benefit
Plans to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, as
determined by Parent in good faith after taking into account all the facts
and circumstances; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall be
binding upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of the Parties to this
Agreement and their assignees and nothing in the foregoing, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights,
benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of the
foregoing provision. In addition,  



 

65  and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all Post-Merger Plans to the extent coverage under such
Post-Merger Plan replaces coverage under any Company Benefit Plan or employee
policy or program in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (each a "
_Pre-Merger Plan_ "); and (ii) for purposes of each Post-Merger Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such Post-Merger Plan to be waived for such
employee and his or her covered dependents, and Parent shall cause any
eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Pre-Merger Plan ending on the date
such employees participation in the corresponding Post-Merger Plan begins to
be taken into account under such Post-Merger Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Post-Merger
Plan.

(b) Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger constitutes
a "change in control" under each of the executive employment agreements of
the Company described in _Section 5.15(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
but not for other purposes, including under other agreements, if any, that
cross-reference or are affected by such executive employment agreements. 

(c) Parent and the Company agree that the employment agreements listed in
_Section 5.15 _of the Company Disclosure Letter may be amended as of the
Effective Time so that the executive officers of the Company who are parties
to such agreements shall not be bound by any of the noncompetition provisions
set forth in Section 7 of their respective employment agreements (but shall
continue to be bound by the other applicable provisions of such agreements).

(d) Notwithstanding any Post-Merger Plan or other plan adopted or maintained
by Parent, Parent shall continue and maintain the TODCO Severance Policy (as
of February 27, 2007) (the " _TODCO Severance Policy_ ") for a period of not
less than 18 months after the Effective Time and shall not terminate or
reduce any benefits or rights thereunder for a period of not less than 18
months after the Effective Time.

(e) Until the first anniversary of the calendar year-end following the
Effective Time, Parent shall either maintain and continue the Company 401(k)
plan as in effect immediately preceding the Effective Time for Company
Employees or provide a Parent or Subsidiary 401(k) plan that allows elective
deferrals by participants up to an amount of compensation and provides for
employer matching contributions on such elective deferrals at maximum rates at
least equal to those allowed and provided under the Company 401(k) plan in
effect on the date that is 30 days prior to the date of this Agreement.

(f) Parent shall provide the benefits as described in _Section 5.15(f)(i)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter to the individuals as specified thereon
(subject to an appropriate waiver from each individual) in lieu of the life
insurance and disability insurance benefits to which such individuals or
their dependants and beneficiaries would otherwise be entitled under the
employment agreements set forth in _Section 5.15(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter and the TODCO Severance Policy pursuant to the welfare plans
of the Company in effect on the date of this Agreement. Parent acknowledges
that Company shall make a lump sum payment to the individuals specified in
_Section 5.15(f)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (subject to an
appropriate waiver from each individual) in lieu of the medical, dental and
vision benefits to which such individuals and their dependants would otherwise
be entitled under the employment agreements set forth in _Section 5.15(b)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter and the TODCO Severance Policy pursuant to the
welfare plans of the Company in effect on the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ , that the aggregate of such lump sum amounts shall be the lesser
of (i) the aggregate commercially reasonable and adequately documented cost
of such coverage divided by 65%, and (ii) $5 million.



 

66 (g) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the executive
officers of Parent named on  _Section 5.15(g)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Letter to waive and cause to be ineffective, for no or nominal consideration,
the "change of control" or "change in control" provisions, as may be the case,
for all purposes under the executive employment agreements of such executive
officers and equity grants under the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan, in
connection with the consummation of the Merger.

Section 5.16 Parent Board of Directors.

(a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall take the actions described in _Section
2.3(d)_. At or prior to Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent written
resignations of all members of the Board of Directors of the Company and all
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to be effective as of the
Effective Time.

(b) At the Effective Time, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
consistent with the DGCL and NASDAQ rules to appoint a Company Director to be
the chair of Parents compensation committee and to appoint Parent Directors
to be the chairs of Parents nominating governance and audit committees.

(c) The provisions of _Section 2.3(d)_ shall be set forth in the bylaws of
Parent and the charter of the Special Governance Committee. Until the third
anniversary of the Effective Time, any amendments to the bylaws of Parent or
the charter of the Special Governance Committee relating to the terms of
_Section 2.3(d)_ shall require the affirmative vote of at least 75% of the
full Board of Directors of Parent.

Section 5.17 Tax Matters.

(a) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall each use its best efforts to
cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and to obtain the Tax opinions set forth in
_Section 6.2(d) _and _Section 6.3(e)_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agree to file all Tax Returns consistent with the treatment of the Merger
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. This
Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Sec. 1.368-2(g).

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall deliver to Andrews Kurth LLP and Porter and
Hedges, L.L.P. an officers certificate dated as of the Closing Date and
signed by an officer of Parent, containing representations of Parent and
Merger Sub, and the Company shall deliver to Porter and Hedges, L.L.P. and
Andrews Kurth LLP an officers certificate dated as of the Closing Date
and signed by an officer of the Company, containing representations of the
Company, in each case as shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to
enable Andrews Kurth LLP to render the opinion described in _Section 6.2(d)_
of this Agreement and Porter and Hedges, L.L.P. to render the opinion described
in _Section 6.3(e)_ of this Agreement. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall use its best efforts not to take or cause to be taken any action
that would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any
action which would cause to be untrue) any of the certifications and
representations included in the officers certificates described in this
_Section 5.17_.

(c) The Company shall provide Parent with a certification in accordance with
the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3) that it is not
a United States real property holding corporation.



 

67 (d) Prior to the Merger, the Company and each Company Subsidiary, and after
the Merger both the Parent and Merger Sub, shall comply with all provisions
and terms of the TSA.

(e) Parent has no present plan or intention to exercise its authority under
Article 4(e) of Division B of its Certificate of Incorporation to redeem any
Parent Common Stock transferred in the Merger. Further, Parent shall not
redeem any such shares without first obtaining a tax opinion from a
nationally recognized law firm that the Merger will qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code if any such redemption
occurs.

(f) The Parties intend and believe that this Agreement constitutes a binding
Contract for fixed consideration pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-1(e)(2).

Section 5.18 Continuing Obligation to Call, Hold and Convene Stockholders
Meeting; No Other Vote. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
obligations of Parent or the Company (as the case may be) to call, give notice
of, convene and hold its Parent Meeting or Company Meeting (as applicable)
shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement,
disclosure, announcement or submission to it of any Acquisition Proposal with
respect to it, or by any determination by the Board of Directors of Parent or
the Company (as the case may be) to modify, withdraw, amend or modify its
recommendation in favor of the Merger. Other than in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 5.4_, neither Parent nor the Company shall submit to
the vote of its respective stockholders any Acquisition Proposal, or propose
to do so.

Section 5.19 Additional Agreements. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree
to execute and deliver any and all additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition,
Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent in
the actions contemplated by the Commitment Letter.

Section 5.20 Control of Other Partys Business. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct Parents operation or give Parent, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective
Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Company and Parent shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its respective operations.

effect that such executive officer shall not sell, contract to sell or
otherwise dispose of any Company Common Stock or rights to acquire such shares
of Company Common Stock, except as permitted by such lock-up agreement.

Article 6

Conditions

each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood
that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart.

Section 8.5 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make such term or
provision valid and enforceable, _provided_ that if such term or provision is
incapable of being so modified, then such term or provision shall be deemed
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

Section 8.6 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
(together with the Confidentiality Agreement and the documents
and instruments delivered by the Parties in connection with this Agreement):
(a) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof; and (b) except as provided in _Section 5.14_
(which is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby) and
_Section 5.15(d)_ and _Section 5.15(e)_ (which is intended to be for
the benefit of the Persons covered thereby) is solely for the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors, legal representatives and assigns and
does not confer on any Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies
hereunder. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the
Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the Parties hereto in accordance with _Section 8.10_ without
notice of liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of
knowledge of any of the Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties
may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of
this Agreement or as of any other date. Without limiting the foregoing, it is
expressly understood and agreed that the provisions of _Section 5.15(a)_ are
statements of intent, and no Company Employee or other Person shall have any
rights or remedies with respect thereto (including any right of employment)
and no Person is intended to be a Third Party beneficiary thereof.

Section 8.7 Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects,
including validity, interpretation and effect, by the Laws of the State of
Delaware (including the Laws of Delaware with respect to statutes of
limitation and statutes of repose) applicable to Contracts entered into and
to be performed solely in such state.



 

77 Section 8.8 No Remedy in Certain Circumstances. Each Party agrees that, should
any Governmental Authority hold any provision of this Agreement or part
hereof to be null, void or unenforceable, or order any Party to take any
action inconsistent herewith or not to take an action consistent herewith or
required hereby, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions and obligations contained or set forth herein shall not in any way
be affected or impaired thereby, unless the foregoing inconsistent action or
the failure to take any action constitutes a material breach of this
Agreement or makes this Agreement impossible to perform, in which case this
Agreement shall terminate pursuant to _Article 7_. Except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent that a Party took an action
inconsistent herewith or failed to take action consistent herewith or required
hereby pursuant to an Order or judgment of a court or other competent
Governmental Authority, such Party shall not incur any liability or obligation
unless such Party breached its obligations under _Section 5.8_ or did not in
good faith seek to resist or object to the imposition or entering of such
Order or judgment.

Section 8.9 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other Parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

Section 8.10 Waivers. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties
may, to the extent legally allowed: (a) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive performance of any of the
covenants or agreements, or satisfaction of any of the conditions, contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed by an
authorized representative of such Party. Except as provided in this
Agreement, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any
investigation by or on behalf of any Party, shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance with any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision hereof shall
not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of
the same or any other provisions hereof.

Section 8.11 Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect following the execution of this Agreement is
hereby incorporated herein by reference, and shall constitute a part of this
Agreement for all purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that any standstill
provisions contained therein will, effective as of the Closing, be deemed to
have been waived to the extent necessary for the Parties to consummate the
Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Any and all information
received by Parent and the Company pursuant to the terms and provisions of
this Agreement shall be governed by the applicable terms and provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 8.12 Incorporation. Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein are
attached to and by this reference incorporated herein for all purposes.

FORM OF LOCK-UP AGREEMENT

_ _, 2007

This lock-up agreement (this " _Lock-Up Agreement_ ") is being delivered to
you in connection with the Merger Agreement (the " _Merger Agreement_ ")
entered into by and among Hercules Offshore, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Hercules_ "), TODCO, a Delaware corporation (" _TODCO_ ") and The Hercules

In connection with the Merger Agreement, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,

any shares of common stock of Hercules and TODCO (" _Common Stock_ ") or any
securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common
Stock, or warrants or other rights to purchase Common Stock, or (ii) enter
into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in

or warrants or other rights to purchase Common Stock, whether any such
transaction is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or such other

  Exhibit 5.9

FORM OF AFFILIATE LETTER

_ _, 2007

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of TODCO, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), as the term
"affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of
the Rules and Regulations (the " _Rules and Regulations_ ") of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the " _Commission_ ") under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the " _Securities Act_ "). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 18, 2007 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "),
by and among the Company, Hercules Offshore, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), and The Hercules Offshore Drilling Company LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (" _Merger Sub_ "), the Company will be
merged with and into Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, in
consideration of cash and shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ "), with Merger Sub as the Surviving
Company (the " _Merger_ ").

I represent, warrant, and covenant to Parent and Merger Sub that in the event
I receive any Parent Common Stock as a result of the Merger:

A. I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of any Parent
Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger in violation of the Securities Act.

B. I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed
their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell,
transfer, or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Stock, to the extent I felt
necessary, with my counsel or counsel for Parent and Merger Sub.

C. I have been advised that the issuance of Parent Common Stock to me pursuant
to the Merger has been or will be registered with the Commission under the
Securities Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4 and will not be
"restricted securities" as defined in Rule 144(a)(3) of the Rules and
Regulations. I have also been advised, however, that, because at the time the
Merger will be submitted for a vote of the stockholders of the Company, I may
be deemed to be an affiliate of the Company (without anything in this letter
agreement being an admission of such fact), the distribution by me of any
Parent Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger will not be registered under
the Securities Act and that I may not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of
any Parent Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger unless (i) such sale,
transfer, or other disposition has been registered under the Securities Act,
(ii) such sale, transfer, or other disposition is made in conformity with the
volume and other limitations of Rule 145(d) promulgated by the Commission
under the Securities Act, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably
acceptable to Parent such sale, transfer, or other disposition is otherwise
exempt from registration under the Securities Act.

D. I understand that Parent is under no obligation to register under the
Securities Act the sale, transfer, or other disposition by me or on my behalf
of any Parent Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger or to take any other
action necessary in order to make an exemption from such registration
available.



 

Exhibit 5.9 Page 1 E. I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Parents
transfer agent with respect to Parent Common Stock and that there will be
placed on the certificates (or in the case of shares issued in book-entry
form, an appropriate notation of the records of Parents transfer agent) for
any Parent Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger, or any substitutions
therefore, a legend stating in substance:

"The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to
which Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933 may apply. The shares
represented by this certificate may only be transferred in compliance with the
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, including, without limitation,
Rule 145 promulgated thereunder, or pursuant to an applicable exemption
therefrom."

F. It is understood and agreed that the legend set forth in paragraph E above
shall be removed by the delivery of substitute certificates (or change in
notation on the records of Parents transfer agent) without such legend if the
undersigned shall have delivered to Parent a copy of a letter from the staff
of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that such legend is not required for
purposes of the Securities Act.

I understand that (a) Parent will supply me with any information necessary to
enable me to make routine sales of any Parent Common Stock acquired by me in
the Merger as may be permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of
Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any similar rule of the Commission
hereafter applicable, and (b) Parent will comply with all requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ "), with respect to the filing by Parent of
annual, periodic and other reports on a timely basis in a manner sufficient to
allow sales of any such Parent Common Stock by me during the two year period
following the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) if such
sales are otherwise permitted by law or regulation. Upon my written request,
Parent shall furnish me with a written statement representing that it has
complied with the reporting requirements enumerated in Rule 144(c)(1), or if
Parent is not then subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, that it
has made publicly available the information concerning Parent required by
Rule 144(c)(2).
