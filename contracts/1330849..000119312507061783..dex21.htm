Commission (the &#147;<U>Commission</U>&#148;) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the &#147;<U>Securities Act</U>&#148;). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of

advised, however, that, because at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the stockholders of the Company, I may be deemed to be an affiliate of the Company (without anything in this letter agreement being an admission of such fact),
the distribution by me of any Parent Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger will not be registered under the Securities Act and that I may not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any Parent Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger unless
(i)&nbsp;such sale, transfer, or other disposition has been registered under the Securities Act, (ii)&nbsp;such sale, transfer, or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145(d) promulgated by the
Commission under the Securities Act, or (iii)&nbsp;in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent such sale, transfer, or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Securities Act. </FONT></P> <P

Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the &#147;<U>Exchange Act</U>&#148;), with respect to the filing by Parent of annual, periodic and other reports on a timely basis in a manner sufficient to allow sales of
