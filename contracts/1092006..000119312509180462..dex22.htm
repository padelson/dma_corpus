 GUARANTEE      

Exhibit 2.2

_Execution Version_

GUARANTEE

This Guarantee is made by Advent International GPE VI Limited Partnership,
Advent International GPE VI-A Limited Partnership, Advent International
GPE VI-B Limited Partnership, Advent International GPE VI-C Limited
Partnership, Advent International GPE VI-D Limited Partnership, Advent
International GPE VI-E Limited Partnership, Advent International GPE VI-F
Limited Partnership, and Advent International GPE VI-G Limited Partnership,
each a limited partnership under its jurisdiction of formation (collectively,
the " _Guarantors_ ", and each, a " _Guarantor_ "), in favor of Charlotte
Russe Holding, Inc. (the " _Guaranteed Party_ "), as of August 24, 2009 (this
" _Guarantee_ ").

Capitalized terms used herein without definition have the meanings given to
them in the Merger Agreement (as defined below).

1\. GUARANTEE. To induce the Guaranteed Party to enter into the Agreement and
Plan of Merger of even date herewith (as amended, amended and restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_
"), by and among Advent CR Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Parent_ "), the equity securities of which are currently-owned directly or
indirectly by the Guarantors, Advent CR, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Merger Sub_ "), and the Guaranteed Party, each Guarantor, jointly and
severally, hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees,
subject to the Aggregate Limit (defined below), as primary obligor and not
merely as surety, the due and punctual payment, performance and discharge of
the obligation of the Parent and Merger Sub to pay or perform, or to provide
adequate funds for the payment of, (a) the Offer Price, net to seller in cash,
without interest on terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
the Merger Agreement, for each of the tendered Shares pursuant to Section
1.1, (b) the Merger Consideration for each of the other Shares pursuant to
Sections 2.2(a) and 2.3(a) of the Merger Agreement, (c) any obligations of
Parent or Merger Sub under Section 6.5 of the Merger Agreement, (d) any
liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by the Guaranteed Party as a
result of the breach by the Parent or Merger Sub of any of their
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements under the Merger
Agreement (including, without limitation, as described in the parenthetical in
the first sentence of Section 8.2), and (e) Parents and Merger Subs
obligations pursuant to Section 9.11 of the Merger Agreement to perform
specifically the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement, to the extent
such specific performance is found in a judicial determination (or settlement
tantamount thereto) to be required pursuant to the terms and conditions of
the Merger Agreement (collectively, the " _Obligations_ "). In furtherance of
the foregoing, the Guarantors acknowledge that their liability hereunder shall
extend to the full amount of the Obligations, subject to the Aggregate Limit,
and that the Guaranteed Party may, in its sole discretion, bring and prosecute
a separate action or actions against the Guarantors for the full amount of the
Obligations up to the Aggregate Limit, regardless of whether action
is brought against the Parent or Merger Sub or whether the Parent or Merger
Sub is joined in any such action. Notwithstanding anything in this Guarantee
to the contrary, in no event shall the aggregate monetary amount of the
Obligations or the joint aggregate liability of the Guarantors hereunder
exceed US$373,175,088.85 (or US$382,816,925.92, in the event that specific
performance is found in a judicial determination (or settlement tantamount
thereto) to be required pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement) (the " _Aggregate Limit_ "), and the Guaranteed Party agrees that
it shall not assert any claim, directly or indirectly, that the Guarantors (or
any of them) are liable for any amount in excess of the Aggregate Limit. 2\. _NATURE OF GUARANTEE_. The Guaranteed Party shall not be obligated to file
any claim relating to the Obligations in the event that the Parent or Merger
Sub becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and
the failure of the Guaranteed Party to so file shall not affect the
Guarantors obligations hereunder. In the event that any payment to the
Guaranteed Party in respect of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise
be returned for any reason whatsoever, the Guarantors shall remain liable
hereunder with respect to the Obligations as if such payment had not been
made. This is an unconditional guarantee of payment and not of collectibility.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Guarantee, the Guaranteed Party
hereby agrees that any Guarantor may assert, as a defense to such payment
or performance by the Guarantors under this Guarantee, any rights, remedies,
set-offs and defenses to such payment or performance that the Parent or Merger
Sub could assert against the Guaranteed Party under the terms of the Merger
Agreement or pursuant to any applicable Law in connection therewith (other
than any such rights, remedies, set-offs and defenses arising out of, due to,
or as a result of, the insolvency or bankruptcy of the Parent or Merger Sub
(including, without limitation, the rejection of the Merger Agreement in an
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Parent or Merger Sub)).

3\. _CHANGES IN OBLIGATIONS, CERTAIN WAIVERS_.

(a) The Guarantors agree that the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder
shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise
affected by (i) the failure of the Guaranteed Party to assert any claim or
demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Parent or Merger Sub (or
any of their respective permitted assignees), any other Guarantor or
any other Person; (ii) any change in time, place or manner of payment of any
of the Obligations or any recission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or
other amendment to or modification of any of the terms or provisions of the
Merger Agreement made in accordance with the terms thereof or any other
agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of
the Obligations; (iii) the addition, substitution or release of Parent, Merger
Sub or any of Parents or Merger Subs permitted assignees or any other
Person; (iv) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of
the Parent, Merger Sub (or any of their respective permitted assignees) or any
other Person; (v) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar
proceeding affecting the Parent or Merger Sub (or any of their respective
permitted assignees), any other Guarantor or any other Person; (vi) the
existence of any claim, set-off or other right which the Guarantors may have
at any time against the Parent, Merger Sub or the Guaranteed Party or any of
their affiliates, whether in connection with the Obligations or otherwise
(other than those described in the last sentence of  _paragraph 2_ above);
(vii) the adequacy of any other means the Guaranteed Party may have of
obtaining repayment of any of the Obligations; (viii) any discharge of any
other Guarantor as a matter of applicable Law (other than as a result of
indefeasible payment of the Obligations in accordance with their terms); or
(ix) the value, genuineness, validity, regularity, illegality or
enforceability of the Merger Agreement. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, the Guarantors hereby expressly waive any and all rights or defenses
arising by reason of any law which would otherwise require any election of
remedies by the Guaranteed Party. The Guarantors waive promptness, diligence,
notice of the acceptance of this Guarantee and of the Obligations,
presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor
and protest, notice of the incurrence of any Obligations and all other notices
of any kind (except  



 

2  for notices to be provided to the Parent or Merger Sub and Weil, Gotshal and
Manges LLP in accordance with Section 9.1 of the Merger Agreement), all
defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium
law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the
marshalling of assets of the Parent or Merger Sub or any other person
interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and all
suretyship defenses generally. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the
contrary, each Guarantor may assert any right, remedy, set-off and defense to
the payment of the Obligations that are available to the Parent or Merger Sub
under the Merger Agreement (other than any such rights, remedies, set-offs and
defenses arising out of, or due to, or as a result of, the insolvency or
bankruptcy of the Parent or Merger Sub (including, without limitation, the
rejection of the Merger Agreement in an insolvency or bankruptcy of the Parent
or Merger Sub)). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Guarantee, the Guaranteed Party hereby agrees that to the extent the Parent
or Merger Sub is relieved of their respective obligations and liabilities
under the Merger Agreement (other than due to, in connection with, or as a
result of, the insolvency or bankruptcy of the Parent or Merger Sub
(including, without limitation, the rejection of the Merger Agreement in an
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Parent or Merger Sub)), the Guarantors shall
be similarly relieved of the Obligations under this Guarantee. The Guaranteed
Party agrees that any payment made by Parent or Merger Sub to the Guaranteed
Party with respect to an Obligation in accordance with the Merger Agreement
shall reduce the Guarantors obligations under this Guarantee by 98.13% of the
amount of such payment. The Guarantors acknowledge that they will receive
substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this Guarantee are
knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

(b) The Guarantors hereby covenant and agree that they shall not institute,
directly or indirectly, and shall cause their affiliates not to
institute, directly or indirectly, any litigation or other proceeding
asserting that this Guarantee is illegal, invalid or unenforceable in
accordance with its terms. The Guarantors hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably agree not to exercise any rights that they may now have or
hereafter acquire against the Parent or Merger Sub that arise from the
existence, payment, performance, or enforcement of the Guarantors obligations
under or in respect of this Guarantee or any other agreement in connection
with this Guarantee, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation,
reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to
participate in any claim or remedy of the Guaranteed Party against the Parent
or Merger Sub, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or
under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the
right to take or receive from the Parent or Merger Sub, directly or
indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner,
payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and
until all of the Obligations and all other amounts payable under this
Guarantee shall have been paid in full in cash;  _provided_ that the
Guarantors shall have the right to cause any other person to satisfy its
payment obligations to the Guaranteed Party hereunder. If any amount shall be
paid to the Guarantors in violation of the immediately preceding sentence at
any time prior to the payment in full of the Obligations and all other amounts
payable under this Guarantee, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount
paid to the Guarantors in violation of the immediately preceding sentence
and (ii) all amounts payable under this Guarantee shall be received and held
in trust for the benefit of the Guaranteed Party, shall be segregated from
other property and funds of the Guarantors and shall forthwith be paid or
delivered to the Guaranteed Party in the same form as  



 

3  so received (with any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be credited
and applied to the Obligations and all other amounts payable under this
Guarantee, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, whether
matured or unmatured, or to be held as collateral for any of the Obligations
or other amounts payable under this Guarantee thereafter arising.

4\. _EXPENSES_. The Guarantors agree to pay on demand all reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses (including reasonable fees of counsel) incurred by
the Guaranteed Party in connection with the enforcement of its rights
hereunder if (i) any Guarantor asserts in any litigation or other proceeding
that this Guarantee is illegal, invalid or unenforceable in accordance with
its terms and (ii) the Guaranteed Party prevails in such litigation or
proceeding.

5\. _NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE RIGHTS_. No failure on the part of the Guaranteed
Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise by the Guaranteed Party of any right, remedy or power hereunder,
under the Merger Agreement or otherwise, preclude any other or future
exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder. Each and every right, remedy
and power hereby granted to the Guaranteed Party or allowed the Guaranteed
Party by law or other agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any
other, and may be exercised by the Guaranteed Party at any time or from time
to time.

6.  _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_. Each Guarantor hereby represents and
warrants to the Guaranteed Party that:

(a) such Guarantor is a validly existing entity in good standing under its
jurisdiction of organization; it has the power and authority to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Guarantee; the execution,
delivery and performance of this Guarantee have been duly authorized by all
necessary action and do not contravene any provision of such Guarantors
limited partnership agreement, or any law, regulation, rule, decree, order,
judgment or material contract binding on such Guarantor or its assets; 

(b) all consents, approvals, authorizations, permits of, filings with and
notifications to, any governmental authority necessary for the due execution,
delivery and performance of this Guarantee by such Guarantor have been
obtained or made and all conditions thereof have been duly complied with, and
no other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental
authority or regulatory body is required in connection with its execution,
delivery or performance of this Guarantee;

(c) this Guarantee constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such
Guarantor enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms,
subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors rights
generally, and (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law); and

(d) such Guarantor has the financial capacity to pay and perform its
obligations under this Guarantee, and all funds necessary for such Guarantor
to fulfill its obligations under this Guarantee are and shall be available to
such Guarantor (or its assignee pursuant to _Section 7_ hereof) for as long
as this Guarantee shall remain in effect in accordance with _Section 9_
hereof.



 

4 7\. _ASSIGNMENT_. Neither the Guarantors nor the Guaranteed Party may assign
its rights, interests or obligations hereunder to any other Person (except by
operation of law) without the prior written consent of the Guaranteed Party
(in the case of an assignment by a Guarantor) or the Guarantors (in the case
of an assignment by the Guaranteed Party);  _provided_ , _however_ , that if
a portion of a Guarantors commitment under its Equity Commitments is assigned
in accordance with the terms thereof, then a corresponding portion of its
obligations hereunder may be assigned to the same assignee without the
consent of the Guaranteed Party; _provided_ that any such assignment will not
relieve such Guarantor of its obligations hereunder.

8\. _NOTICES_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be given (a) on the date of delivery if delivered
personally, (b) on the first business day following the date of dispatch if
delivered by a nationally recognized next-day courier service, (c) on the
fifth business day following the date of mailing if delivered by registered or

enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable law, or otherwise, except for
its rights to recover from each Guarantor (but not any other Parent Affiliate
(including any general partner or managing member)) under, and to the extent
provided in, this Guarantee, subject to the Aggregate Limit. Recourse against
the Guarantors under this Guarantee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Guaranteed Party and all of their affiliates against the Guarantors and
the other Parent Affiliates in respect of any liabilities or obligations
arising under, or in connection with, the Merger Agreement or
the transactions contemplated thereby. Nothing set forth in this Guarantee
shall affect or be construed to affect any liability of the Parent or Merger
Sub to the Guaranteed Party or shall confer or give or shall be construed to
confer or give to any person other than the Guaranteed Party (including any
person acting in a representative capacity) any rights or remedies against any
person other than the Guarantors as expressly set forth herein. This _Section
10_ shall survive the termination of this Guarantee.

11\. _GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION AND FORUM_. This Guarantee shall be governed

the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware. Any action arising out of or relating to this Guarantee may be
brought exclusively in the federal courts, or in the absence of federal
jurisdiction in state courts, in either case within the State of Delaware,
and each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such action, agrees to take any
and all future action necessary to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts,
waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to venue or to convenience
of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the action shall be heard and
determined only in any such court and agrees not to bring any action arising
out of or relating to this Guarantee or any transaction contemplated hereby
in any other court. The parties agree that any of them may file a copy of this
paragraph with any court as written evidence of the knowing, voluntary and
bargained agreement between the parties irrevocably to waive any objections
to venue or to convenience of forum.



 

6 12\. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL

CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

13\. _COUNTERPARTS_. This Guarantee may be executed and delivered (including
by facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts, and by the different
parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be
deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one
and the same instrument.

14\. _AMENDMENT_. This Guarantee may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

this Guarantee may not be enforced without giving effect to the Aggregate
Limit and the provisions of _Section 9_ and _10_ hereof.

16\. _NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES_. The parties hereby agree that their
respective representations, warranties, agreements and covenants set forth
