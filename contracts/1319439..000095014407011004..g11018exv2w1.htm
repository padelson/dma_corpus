 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of December 10, 2007, is entered into by and among Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, a United Kingdom corporation (" _Parent_ "), Twickenham Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Adams Respiratory Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

   

 WHEREAS, it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub shall commence a cash tender offer (such tender offer, as it may be extended, amended and supplemented from time to time as permitted by this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), at a price per share equal to $60.00, net to the sellers in cash (such amount or any greater amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer, the " _Offer Price_ "), subject to any required withholding of Taxes under applicable Law; 

   

 WHEREAS, it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), pursuant to which each outstanding share of Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, except for (i) shares of Company Common Stock held by holders who comply with the relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ") regarding the right of stockholders to dissent from the Merger and require appraisal of their shares; (ii) shares of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company; and (iii) and shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or the Company; 

   

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i) approved and adopted this Agreement, (ii) determined that the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (iii) declared the advisability of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL, and (iv) recommended that the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stockholders_ ") accept the Offer, tender their shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer, and adopt this Agreement, in each case, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and 

   

 WHEREAS, each of the Board of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub has (i) approved and adopted this Agreement, (ii) determined that the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of their respective corporations, and (iii) declared the advisability of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

    ##### 

  

     

ARTICLE I 

   

THE OFFER  

  

 Section 1.01. _The Offer_. 

  

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Article VIII and none of the events or conditions set forth in Annex A shall have occurred and be existing and shall not have been waived in writing by Parent or Merger Sub (the conditions set forth in Annex A, the " _Tender Offer Conditions_ "), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer as soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than twenty (20) Business Days after the date of this Agreement. Without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not decrease the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, decrease the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought to be purchased in the Offer, impose conditions on the Offer in addition to the Tender Offer Conditions, waive or amend the Minimum Condition or, except as may be required by a Governmental Authority, amend any other term of the Offer in a manner that is materially adverse to the Company Stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to increase the Offer Price and to waive any of the Tender Offer Conditions, other than the Minimum Condition. The Company agrees that no shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered in the Offer. 

   

 (b) Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer on the date that the Offer is commenced, which tender offer statement shall include an offer to purchase, form of letter of transmittal and form of notice of guaranteed delivery (together with any supplements or amendments thereto, collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and, subject to the Companys compliance with _Section 1.02(c)_, cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders in accordance with the applicable requirements of the U.S. federal securities Laws. Parent and Merger Sub agree that the Offer Documents shall comply in all material respects with the applicable U.S. federal securities Laws and, on the date first filed with the SEC, on the date first published, sent or given to the Company Stockholders and upon consummation of the Offer (including all applicable extensions and subsequent offering periods), shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no covenant, agreement, representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub each agree promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Company Stockholders to the extent required by applicable Law.

whole number, that represents the same percentage as such
individuals represent on the Board of Directors of the Company, other than
any committee of the Board of Directors of the Company established to take
action under this Agreement, which committee shall be composed only of
Independent Incumbent Directors. 

   

 (b) The Companys obligation to appoint Merger Subs designees to the Board of Directors of the Company shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder.

 (i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to and properly demands appraisal of such shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenters  Provisions_") shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Dissenters Provisions; _provided_ , however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to dissent under the Dissenters Provisions, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the Merger Consideration (payable without any interest thereon).

 Section 2.10. _Exchange of Shares_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration for the benefit of the holders of (i) certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") and (ii) shares of uncertificated Company Common Stock (" _Uncertificated Shares_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.09(c)_. Any funds deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.10(a)_ shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Company Stockholder of record whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent and 

    ##### 

  

    

which shall be in customary form and contain customary provisions) and (ii)
instructions to effect the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertified Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each
Company Stockholder of record shall, upon surrender or transfer to the
Exchange Agent of the Company Common Stock, together with such duly executed
letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount
of cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.09(c)_. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.10(b)_ may be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered
is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that
such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.10(b)_, each Certificate or Uncertificated
Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender. No interest
shall be paid or will accrue on any payment to holders of Certificates or
Uncertificated Share pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the Company Stockholders on the date that is one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any Company Stockholders who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II. 

   

 (e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any funds from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States or of any agency thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or bankers acceptances of, repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with, or Eurodollar time deposits purchased from, commercial banks with 

    ##### 

  

    

capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating in excess of $500 million
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available at the SEC or otherwise). Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to and be income of Parent. If
for any reason (including losses), the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in
cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into
the Exchange Fund in the amount required to fully satisfy such cash payment
obligations. 

   

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person (who shall be the record owner of such Certificate) claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article II. 

   

 (h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Company Stockholder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent.

Parent and RBTS have fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Facility Agreement to be paid as of the date hereof. The Facility Agreement is in full force and effect and, as of the date hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition thereof to the availability of funds thereunder.

Any Tax Returns described in this _Section 5.01(e)_ shall be complete and correct in all material respects and shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the past practice of the Company, except as may be necessary to conform to changes in Tax Laws. The Company shall notify Parent upon the filing of any such material Tax Return and shall make such Tax Returns available to Parent. 

   

 (f) _Approval of Compensation Arrangements_. If the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries enters into, adopts, amends, modifies or terminates any Arrangements with Covered Securityholders, all such amounts payable under such Arrangements shall (i) be paid or granted as compensation for past services performed, future services to be performed, or future services to be refrained from performing, by the Covered Securityholders (and matters incidental thereto) and (ii) shall not be calculated based on the number of shares tendered or to be tendered into the Offer by the applicable Covered Securityholder.

provided pursuant to Rule 14d-10(d)(2) is otherwise applicable thereto as a
result of the taking prior to the Expiration Date all necessary actions by

 Section 5.02. _No Solicitation_. 

   

 (a) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.02_, until the earlier of the Appointment Time or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, the Company shall not, and shall not authorize or permit the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, advisors, agents, representatives or controlled Affiliates (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any Takeover Proposal or inquiries relating thereto or the making thereof, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information in connection with, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Takeover Proposal or (iii) waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any contractual "standstill" or similar obligation of any Person other than Parent. The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished or provided to such Person in connection with the applicable Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Appointment Time, in response to a _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) is, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal, and which Takeover Proposal was not solicited after the date hereof but was made after the date hereof and was not the result of a breach by the Company of this _Section 5.02(a)_ , the Company may, subject to compliance with _Section 5.02(c)_, (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (which shall permit the Company to comply with the terms of _Section 5.02(c)_) containing confidentiality and standstill provisions not less restrictive to such Person than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent; _provided_ that all such information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal, if and only to the extent that in connection with the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to take such action would constitute a breach of the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 

  

 The term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of transactions, of assets (including equity securities of 

   ##### 

  

    

any Company Subsidiary) or businesses that constitute twenty percent (20%) or
more of the revenues, net income or assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or twenty percent (20%) or more of any class
of equity securities of the Company, any tender offer or exchange offer that
if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning twenty
percent (20%) or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, or
any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, share exchange or similar
transaction involving the Company or the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to
which any Person or the stockholders of any Person would own twenty percent
(20%) or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or of any
resulting parent company of the Company, in each case other than the
Transactions. 

  

 The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be: (i) more favorable to the Company Stockholders from a financial point of view than the Offer and the Merger, and (ii) reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal. 

  

 (b) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.02_, until the earlier of the Appointment Time or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw, modify or qualify the Company Recommendation in any manner adverse to Parent, (B) take any other action or make any public statement in connection with the Company Recommendation, the Offer, the Merger or the Company Stockholders Meeting that is inconsistent with the Company Recommendation or (C) adopt or recommend, or propose publicly to adopt or recommend, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (ii) adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt or recommend, or approve the Companys or the Company Subsidiaries execution or entry into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar Contract constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in  _Section 5.02(a)_) (an " _Acquisition Agreement"_ ). 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the Appointment Time and subject to _Section 5.02(d)_, the Board of Directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (i) not in response to a Takeover Proposal, if the Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the failure of the Board of Directors to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would constitute a breach of the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (ii) in response to a Takeover Proposal, if the Board of Directors of the Company concludes that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and such Takeover Proposal was not solicited after the date hereof but was made after the date hereof and was not the result of a material breach of this _Section 5.02_; _provided_ that the Companys Board of Directors shall not make any such Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless (x) the Company promptly notifies Parent in writing at least five Business Days before taking such action of its intention to do so in response to a 

    ##### 

  

    

Takeover Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, attaching the most
current version of any proposed agreement or a detailed summary of
the material terms of any such proposal and the identity of the offeror and
(y) Parent does not make, within such five Business Day period, a firm offer
that is at least as favorable to the holders of Company Common Stock as
determined by the Companys Board of Directors in good faith, as
such Superior Proposal. If the Board of Directors of the Company makes a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 5.02(c)_,
the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(f),_ and
enter into an Acquisition Agreement, if the Board of Directors of the Company
has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel,
that, in light of such Superior Proposal or otherwise, the failure of the
Board of Directors to terminate this Agreement would constitute a breach of
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 

   

 (d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in subsections (a) through (c) of this _Section 5.02_, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of learning of the relevant information) advise Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of any Takeover Proposal, inquiry relating thereto or request for information from any Person, the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent informed in all material respects of the status and details (including any change to the material terms thereof) of any Takeover Proposal. The Company shall publicly reaffirm its adoption and recommendation of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions within five (5) Business Days of receipt of a written request by Parent to provide such reaffirmation, unless a Company Adverse Recommendation Change is permitted by _Section 5.02(c)_. 

   

 (e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.02_ shall prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company from at any time taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or making a statement required under Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or other applicable Law; _provided_ , however, that in no event shall the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by _Section 5.02(b)_.

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall take or cause to be taken all actions necessary to effectuate this  _Section 6.04_ to the extent such treatment is not expressly provided for by the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plans and related award agreements.

 (c) Through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain (directly or indirectly through the Companys existing insurance programs) in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (a complete and accurate copy of which has been previously delivered to Parent), on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , however, that Parent may (i) substitute policies of Parent containing terms with respect to coverage (including with respect to deductibles and exclusions) and amounts no less favorable to such directors and officers or (ii) request that the Company obtain such extended reporting period coverage under its existing insurance programs, to be effective as of the Effective Time. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) The provisions of this _Section 6.05_ (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract or otherwise.

 (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_ then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee, by wire transfer of same-day funds concurrently with such termination.

 (i) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)_ and, prior to the breach giving rise to such right of termination, a Takeover Proposal has been publicly announced or shall have otherwise become publicly known and, in each case, not abandoned or withdrawn; or 

  

 (ii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ or by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(iii)_ and, prior to such termination, a Takeover Proposal has been publicly announced or shall have otherwise become publicly known and, in each case, not abandoned or withdrawn; and within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company enters into a definitive Contract to consummate, or consummates, the transactions contemplated by any Takeover Proposal (regardless of whether such Takeover Proposal is made before or after termination of this Agreement), then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee, by wire transfer of same-day funds on the second (2nd) Business Day following the earlier of the date the Company enters into such Contract or consummates such Takeover Proposal. For purposes of this  _Section 6.06(d)_, all references (whether in words or numerals) to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to refer to "more than fifty percent (50%)". 

  

 (e) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in _Section 6.06_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to _Section 6.06_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences an Action that results in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such Action, together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee and/or expenses, as the case may be, from the date such payment was required

Except with respect to any Company Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be in the form previously agreed to by the parties and shall state the date that Merger Sub intends to commence the Offer.

efforts to cause the lenders and the other Persons providing such financing

Facility Agreement, to the extent required to comply with its obligations
hereunder, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange to
obtain alternative financing as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event. Parent shall not enter into any amendment,
modification or supplement to the Facility Agreement without the prior
written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, to the extent such amendment, modification or supplement imposes
additional conditions precedent to the funding obligations thereunder or
that reduces the amount of the financing committed thereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall deliver a copy of any proposed
amendment to the Facility Agreement to the Company not less than two business
days prior to the execution of the same. Parent and Merger Sub shall give
the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party to the Facility
Agreement or any termination of the Facility Agreement. Upon request of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the Company informed on the current
status of the Financing.

The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement, and accordingly, the parties and named third party beneficiaries hereto shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery or, in the event (but only in the event) such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, any other court of the state of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that, subject to rights with respect to post-trial motions and rights of appeal or other avenues of review, a final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any other state court of the State of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action in any such court. 

  

 Section 9.11. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT 

   ##### 

  

    

SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES
HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS  _SECTION 9.11_. 

  

 Section 9.12. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.
