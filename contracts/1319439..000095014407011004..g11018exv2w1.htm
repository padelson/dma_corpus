<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this &#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;), dated as of December&nbsp;10, 2007,
is entered into by and among Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, a United Kingdom corporation
(&#147;<U>Parent</U>&#148;), Twickenham Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(&#147;<U>Merger Sub</U>&#148;), and Adams Respiratory Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
&#147;<U>Company</U>&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall commence a cash tender offer (such tender offer, as it may be extended,
amended and supplemented from time to time as permitted by this Agreement, the &#147;<U>Offer</U>&#148;) to
purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of
the Company (the &#147;<U>Company Common Stock</U>&#148;), at a price per share equal to $60.00, net to the
sellers in cash (such amount or any greater amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer, the
&#147;<U>Offer Price</U>&#148;), subject to any required withholding of Taxes under applicable Law;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the
Company (the &#147;<U>Merger</U>&#148;), pursuant to which each outstanding share of Company Common Stock
shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, except for (i)&nbsp;shares of Company
Common Stock held by holders who comply with the relevant provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the &#147;<U>DGCL</U>&#148;) regarding the right of stockholders to dissent from the Merger
and require appraisal of their shares; (ii)&nbsp;shares of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of
the Company; and (iii)&nbsp;and shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or the Company;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i)&nbsp;approved and adopted this Agreement,
(ii)&nbsp;determined that the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions are fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, (iii)&nbsp;declared the advisability of this Agreement in
accordance with the DGCL, and (iv)&nbsp;recommended that the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
(the &#147;<U>Company Stockholders</U>&#148;) accept the Offer, tender their shares of Company Common Stock
in the Offer, and adopt this Agreement, in each case, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement; and
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, each of the Board of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub has (i)&nbsp;approved and adopted
this Agreement, (ii)&nbsp;determined that the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions are fair to
and in the best interests of their respective corporations, and (iii)&nbsp;declared the advisability of
this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.

<DIV align="Center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>THE OFFER</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1.01. <U>The Offer</U>.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Article
VIII and none of the events or conditions set forth in Annex A shall have occurred and be existing
and shall not have been waived in writing by Parent or Merger Sub (the conditions set forth in
Annex A, the &#147;<U>Tender Offer Conditions</U>&#148;), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule&nbsp;14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (together with the rules and regulations thereunder, the &#147;<U>Exchange Act</U>&#148;)) the Offer
as soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than twenty (20)&nbsp;Business Days after the date of
this Agreement. Without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not decrease
the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, decrease the number of
shares of Company Common Stock sought to be purchased in the Offer, impose conditions on the Offer
in addition to the Tender Offer Conditions, waive or amend the Minimum Condition or, except as may
be required by a Governmental Authority, amend any other term of the Offer in a manner that is
materially adverse to the Company Stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub expressly
reserves the right to increase the Offer Price and to waive any of the Tender Offer Conditions,
other than the Minimum Condition. The Company agrees that no shares of Company Common Stock held
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered in the Offer.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, file with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the &#147;<U>SEC</U>&#148;) a tender offer statement on Schedule&nbsp;TO with respect to the
Offer on the date that the Offer is commenced, which tender offer statement shall include an offer
to purchase, form of letter of transmittal and form of notice of guaranteed delivery (together with
any supplements or amendments thereto, collectively, the &#147;<U>Offer Documents</U>&#148;) and, subject to
the Company&#146;s compliance with <U>Section&nbsp;1.02(c)</U>, cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated
to the Company Stockholders in accordance with the applicable requirements of the U.S. federal
securities Laws. Parent and Merger Sub agree that the Offer Documents shall comply in all material
respects with the applicable U.S. federal securities Laws and, on the date first filed with the
SEC, on the date first published, sent or given to the Company Stockholders and upon consummation
of the Offer (including all applicable extensions and subsequent offering periods), shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no covenant, agreement,
representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to information supplied by
the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents. The Company,
Parent and Merger Sub each agree promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and Parent further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Company Stockholders to the extent
required by applicable Law. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the Company that is required or reasonably requested by Parent or
Merger Sub in connection

copy of an executed facility agreement dated as of the date hereof by and among Parent, Reckitt
Benckiser Treasury Services PLC (&#147;<U>RBTS</U>&#148;), Barclays Capital and Barclays Bank PLC (the &#147;<U>Facility Agreement</U>&#148;) committing such lenders to
provide to RBTS debt financing in amounts sufficient to consummate the Offer and the Merger,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein (the &#147;<U>Financing</U>&#148;). There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies to obtaining the debt financing contemplated by the
Facility Agreement other than expressly as set forth therein. As of the date hereof, to Parent&#146;s
Knowledge, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default on the part of Parent or RBTS under the Facility Agreement. Parent is not
aware of any fact, occurrence or condition that makes any of the assumptions, statements,
representations or warranties contained in the Facility Agreement inaccurate in any material
respect or that would reasonably be expected to cause the Facility Agreement to be terminated or
ineffective or any of the conditions contained therein not to be met. Parent and RBTS have fully
paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Facility Agreement to be paid as of
the date hereof. The Facility Agreement is in full force and effect and, as of the date hereof,
Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or
condition thereof to the availability of funds thereunder.
