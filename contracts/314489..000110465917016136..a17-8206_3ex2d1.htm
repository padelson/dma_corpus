 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 



 

 **THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER** (together with all exhibits and
schedules, this " **Agreement** ") is entered into as of March 13, 2017, by
and between First Busey Corporation, a Nevada corporation (" **Acquiror** "),
and Mid Illinois Bancorp, Inc., an Illinois corporation (the " **Company** ").

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

 **A.** The boards of directors of the Company and Acquiror have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their
stockholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction
provided for herein, pursuant to which the Company will, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into Acquiror (the "
**Merger** "), with Acquiror as the surviving entity in the Merger (sometimes
referred to in such capacity as the " **Surviving Entity** ").

 



 

 **B.** The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a "reorganization" under
the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement be and
hereby is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections
354 and 361 of the Code.

 



 

 **C.** As an inducement to Acquiror to enter into this Agreement, the
directors and executive officers of the Company in office as of the date of
this Agreement have, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
entered into a Voting and Support Agreement in substantially the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_.

 



 

 **D.** As further inducement to Acquiror to enter into this Agreement, the
Companys Chief Executive Officer has, concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, entered into an Employment Agreement, by and among the Acquiror,
Acquiror Bank and such Chief Executive Officer, which becomes effective as of
the Effective Time and governs the terms of continuing employment for such
executive.

 



 

 **E.** The parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the parties also agree to certain
prescribed conditions to the Merger and other transactions.

 



 

 **AGREEMENTS**

 



 

In consideration of the foregoing premises and the following mutual promises,
covenants and agreements, the parties hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE 1 
THE MERGER**

 



 

 **Section 1.1** _The Merger_. Provided that this Agreement shall not prior
thereto have been terminated in accordance with its express terms, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the NRS and the IBCA, at the Effective Time, the
Company shall be merged with and into Acquiror pursuant

      
 

 



 

to the provisions of, and with the effects provided in, the NRS and the IBCA,
the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease and Acquiror will
be the Surviving Entity.

 



 

 **Section 1.2** _Effective Time; Closing_.

 



 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not prior thereto have been terminated
in accordance with its express terms, the closing of the Merger (the "
**Closing** ") shall occur through the mail or at a place that is mutually
acceptable to Acquiror and the Company, or if they fail to agree, at the
offices of Barack Ferrazzano Kirschbaum and Nagelberg LLP, located at 200 West
Madison Street, Suite 3900, Chicago, Illinois 60606, at 10:00 a.m., local
time, on the date that is five (5) Business Days after the satisfaction or
waiver (subject to applicable Legal Requirements) of the latest to occur of
the conditions set forth in **Article 8** and **Article 9** (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) or at
such other time and place as Acquiror and the Company may agree in writing
(the " **Closing Date** "). Subject to the provisions of **Article 10**,
failure to consummate the Merger on the date and time and at the place
determined pursuant to this **Section 1.2** will not result in the
termination of this Agreement and will not relieve any party of any obligation
under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto agree to file on the Closing Date articles of merger
with the Nevada Secretary of State (the " **Nevada Articles of Merger** "),
and articles of merger with the Illinois Secretary of State (the " **Illinois
Articles of Merger** "). The Merger shall become effective as of the date and
time specified in the Nevada Articles of Merger (the " **Effective Time** ").

 



 

 **Section 1.3** _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time,
the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of
the NRS and the IBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company shall be vested in the Surviving Entity, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Entity.

 



 

 **Section 1.4** _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity_. The
articles of incorporation and bylaws of Acquiror, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof and applicable Legal Requirements.

 



 

 **Section 1.5** _Bank Merger_. The parties will cooperate and use their
reasonable best efforts to effect the Bank Merger at a time to be determined
following the Merger. At the effective time of the Bank Merger, the separate
existence of the Bank will terminate. Acquiror Bank will be the surviving bank
and will continue its existence under applicable Legal Requirements. The Bank
Merger shall be accomplished pursuant to the statutory bank merger agreement
in form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_.

 



 

 **Section 1.6** _Alternative Structure_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, before the Effective Time, the parties
may mutually agree to change the method of effecting the Contemplated
Transactions if and to the extent that they deem such a

 



      
 

 



 

change to be desirable; _provided_ , that: (a) any such change shall not
affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to holders of
Company Common Stock; and (b) no such change shall (i) alter or change the
amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to holders of Company Common
Stock as consideration in the Merger, (ii) materially impede or delay
consummation of the Merger, or (iii) require submission to or approval of the
Companys stockholders after the Merger has been approved by the Companys
stockholders. If the parties agree to make such a change, they shall execute
appropriate documents to reflect the change.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 2 
CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER**

 



 

 **Section 2.1** _Consideration_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Acquiror, the Company or the
holder of any shares of Company Common Stock:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._

 



 

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except for shares of Company Common Stock owned
by the Company or Acquiror (in each case other than shares of Company Common
Stock held in any Company Benefit Plan or related trust accounts or otherwise
held in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts previously
contracted) (the " **Excluded Shares** "), with respect to which an election
to receive only cash (a " **Cash Election** ") has been effectively made and
not revoked or lost pursuant to **Section 2.6** (each, a " **Cash Electing
Company Share** ") shall be converted into the right to receive $227.94 (the "
**Per Share Value** "), without interest; _provided, however_ , that if: (A)
the sum of (1) the product of the number of Cash Electing Company Shares and
the Per Share Value and (2) the product of the number of Mixed Consideration
Electing Company Shares and the Mixed Election Cash Consideration (such sum
being the " **Cash Election Amount** ") exceeds (B) an amount equal to the Per
Share Value, _multiplied by_ 0.30, _multiplied by_ the number of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
other than Excluded Shares (the " **Available Cash** "), then each Cash
Electing Company Share shall instead be converted into the right to receive
(I) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the quotient (rounded to the
nearest hundredth of a cent) determined by dividing (x) an amount equal to the
Available Cash _minus_ the product of the Mixed Election Cash Consideration
and the number of Mixed Consideration Electing Company Shares, by (y) the
number of Cash Electing Company Shares (such fraction being the " **Pro-Rated
Cash Amount** ") and (II) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the product (rounded to
the nearest ten-thousandth of a share) of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) one
(1) _minus_ the quotient obtained by dividing the Pro-Rated Cash Amount by
the Per Share Value;

 



 

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than any Excluded Shares, with respect to
which an election to receive only Acquiror Common Stock (a " **Share
Election** ") has been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to
**Section 2.6** (each, a " **Share Electing Company Share** ") shall be
converted into the right to receive 7.5149 validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Acquiror Common Stock (the " **Exchange Ratio** ");
_provided, however_ , that

 



      
 

 



 

if: (A) the sum of (1) the product of the number of Share Electing Company
Shares and the Exchange Ratio and (2) the product of the number of Mixed
Consideration Electing Company Shares and the Mixed Election Share
Consideration (such sum being the " **Share Election Amount** ") exceeds (B)
an amount equal to the Exchange Ratio, _multiplied by_ 0.70, _multiplied by_
the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares (the " **Available Shares** "),
then each Share Electing Company Share shall instead be converted into the
right to receive (I) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the quotient (rounded to the nearest
ten-thousandth of a share) determined by dividing (x) an amount equal to the
number of Available Shares _minus_ the product of the Mixed Election Share
Consideration and the number of Mixed Consideration Electing Company Shares,
by (y) the number of Share Electing Company Shares (such fraction being the "
**Pro-Rated Share Amount** "), and (II) an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product (rounded to the nearest hundredth of a cent) of (x) the
Per Share Value and (y) one (1) _minus_ the quotient obtained by dividing the
Pro-Rated Share Amount by the Exchange Ratio;

 



 

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than any Excluded Shares, with respect to
which an election to receive Acquiror Common Stock and cash (a " **Mixed
Election** ") has been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to
**Section 2.6** (each, a " **Mixed Consideration Electing Company Share** ")
shall be converted into the right to receive: (x) $68.38, without interest
(the " **Mixed Election Cash Consideration** "), and (y) 5.2604 validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Acquiror Common Stock (the "
**Mixed Election Share Consideration** "); and

 



 

(iv) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares, with respect to which
no Cash Election, Share Election or Mixed Election has been properly made and
not revoked or lost pursuant to **Section 2.6** (each, a " **Non-Electing
Company Share** ") shall be converted into the right to receive (x) an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the quotient (rounded to the nearest
hundredth of a cent) determined by dividing (A) the amount, if any, by which
(I) the Available Cash exceeds (II) the aggregate amount of cash (excluding
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares) payable in respect of Cash Electing
Company Shares, Share Electing Company Shares and Mixed Consideration Electing
Company Shares (the amount of such excess, if any, the " **Remaining Cash
Amount** "), by (B) the number of Non-Electing Company Shares, and (y) a
number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Acquiror
Common Stock equal to the quotient (rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth of a
share) determined by dividing (A) the amount, if any, by which (I) the number
of Available Shares exceeds (II) the aggregate number of shares (including
fractional shares that would otherwise be payable in cash) deliverable in
respect of Cash Electing Company Shares, Share Electing Company Shares and
Mixed Consideration Electing Company Shares (the amount of such excess, if
any, the " **Remaining Share Amount** "), by (B) the number of Non-Electing
Company Shares.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, the Available Cash is equal to $40,498,165 and the
Available Shares are equal to 3,115,503 shares of Acquiror Common Stock.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this **Section 2.1** to the contrary, at the
Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, each share of Company Common Stock
held in the Companys treasury will be cancelled and no shares of Acquiror
Common Stock or other consideration will be issued or paid in exchange
therefor.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if, between the
date hereof and the Effective Time, there is declared (with an effective time
prior to the Effective Time) or effected a reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), split-up or
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible in Acquiror Common Stock), combination, exchange or readjustment
of shares with respect to, or rights issued in respect of, Acquiror Common
Stock, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted to provide to the
holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event.

 



 

 **Section 2.2** _Cancellation of Shares_. At the Effective Time, the shares
of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically
be cancelled and will cease to exist. Certificates (it being understood that
any reference herein to a "certificate" be deemed to include reference to any
book-entry account statement relating to the ownership of Company Common
Stock) that represented Company Common Stock before the Effective Time will be
deemed for all purposes to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender
thereof, the Common Stock Merger Consideration.

 



 

 **Section 2.3** _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Acquiror Common
Stock shall be issued as Common Stock Merger Consideration in the Merger. Each
holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fractional share of Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to this **Article 2**
shall instead be entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest)
rounded to the nearest whole cent, determined by multiplying the Closing
Acquiror Common Stock Price by the fractional share of Acquiror Common Stock
to which such former holder would otherwise be entitled.

 



 

 **Section 2.4** _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) The parties to this Agreement agree: (i) that Computershare Trust Company,
N.A. shall serve, pursuant to the terms of an exchange agent agreement, as the
exchange agent for purposes of this Agreement (the " **Exchange Agent** ");
and (ii) to execute and deliver the exchange agent agreement at or prior to
the Effective Time. Acquiror shall be solely responsible for the payment of
any fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent.

 



 

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror shall authorize the issuance
of and shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this **Article
2**: (i) the aggregate number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock deliverable
pursuant to **Section 2.1**, (ii) the aggregate cash consideration payable
including the amount payable in lieu of fractional shares of Acquiror Common
Stock in accordance with **Section 2.3**. Such amount of cash and shares of
Acquiror Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto paid after the Effective Time, are referred to in this
**Article 2** as the " **Conversion Fund.** "

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Within two (2) Business Days after the Closing Date, Acquiror shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more
certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (" **Company Stock
Certificates** ") a letter of transmittal (" **Letter of Transmittal** "), in
a form to be agreed by the parties, which specifies, among other things, that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such certificates to the
Exchange Agent, together with instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Upon proper surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for exchange to the
Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed and duly executed Letter of
Transmittal, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor his, her or its Common Stock Merger Consideration
plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock in
accordance with **Section 2.3** deliverable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate; thereupon
such Company Stock Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will
be paid or accrued on any portion of the Common Stock Merger Consideration
deliverable upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate.

 



 

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of Outstanding Company Shares.

 



 

(f) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Acquiror
Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock
Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Company Stock
Certificate in accordance with this **Article 2**. Promptly after the
surrender of a Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this **Article
2**, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends
or other distributions, without interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to shares of Acquiror Common Stock into which the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate were
converted at the Effective Time pursuant to **Section 2.1**. No holder of an
unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled, until the surrender
of such Company Stock Certificate, to vote the shares of Acquiror Common Stock
into which such holders Company Common Stock shall have been converted.

 



 

(g) Any portion of the Conversion Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of the Company twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the Surviving Entity, or its successors in interest. Any
stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this
**Article 2** shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity, or its
successors in interest, for issuance and payment of the Common Stock Merger
Consideration (including the payment of cash in lieu of any fractional shares
deliverable in respect of such stockholders shares of Company Common Stock),
as well as any accrued and unpaid dividends or distributions on shares of such
Acquiror Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving
Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former
holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good
faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar laws.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) In the event any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Company Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, and in accordance with
this **Article 2**, the Common Stock Merger Consideration (including cash in
lieu of any fractional shares deliverable in respect of such stockholders
shares of Company Common Stock).

 



 

 **Section 2.5** _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
stockholders who shall have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and who properly shall have demanded payment of the fair
value for such shares in accordance with the IBCA (collectively, the "
**Dissenters  Shares**") shall not be converted into or represent the right
to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration. Such stockholders instead
shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such shares held by
them in accordance with the provisions of the IBCA, except that all
Dissenters Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or
who effectively shall have withdrawn or otherwise lost their rights as
dissenting stockholders under the IBCA shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of the Effective Time, for
the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the Common Stock Merger
Consideration upon surrender in the manner provided in **Section 2.4** of the
certificate(s) that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, evidenced such
shares. The Company shall give Acquiror: (a) prompt notice of any written
demands for payment of fair value of any shares of Company Common Stock,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the IBCA and received by the Company relating to stockholders
dissenters rights; and (b) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to demands under the IBCA consistent with the
obligations of the Company thereunder. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Acquiror, (i) make any payment with respect to such
demand, (ii) offer to settle or settle any demand for payment of fair value or
(iii) waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for payment of fair
value or timely take any other action to perfect payment of fair value rights
in accordance with the IBCA.

 



 

 **Section 2.6** _Election Procedure_.

 



 

(a) Each person who, on or prior to the Election Deadline, is a record holder
of shares of Company Common Stock other than Excluded Shares shall be entitled
to specify the number of such holders shares of Company Common Stock with
respect to which such holder makes a Cash Election, a Share Election or a
Mixed Election.

 



 

(b) Acquiror shall prepare a form of election (the " **Form of Election**")
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Form of
Election shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to any Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Form of Election and any Company Stock Certificates in accordance with
**Section 2.4**. The Company shall mail the Form of Election on a date to be
mutually agreed by Acquiror and the Company that is not more than forty-five
(45), nor less than

 



      
 

 



 

thirty (30) days, prior to the anticipated Closing Date or such other date as
Acquiror and the Company shall mutually agree (the " **Mailing Date** ") to
all persons who are record holders of shares of Company Common Stock as of the
close of business on the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the Mailing Date
(the " **Election Form Record Date**"). The Form of Election shall be used by
each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock (or, in the case of
nominee record holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions and
documentation) to make a Cash Election, a Share Election or a Mixed Election.
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to make the Form of Election
available as may be reasonably requested from time to time by all persons who
become record holders of shares of Company Common Stock during the period
between the Election Form Record Date and the Election Deadline, and the
Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably
necessary for Acquiror and the Exchange Agent to perform as specified herein.

 



 

(c) Any holders election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange
Agent shall have received at its designated office by 5:00 p.m., local time,
on the twenty-fifth (25th) day following the Mailing Date (or such other time
and date as Acquiror and the Company may agree) (the " **Election Deadline**
"), a Form of Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by: (i)
Company Stock Certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock to
which such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in
form acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company (or by an appropriate
guarantee of delivery of such Company Certificates as set forth in such Form
of Election from a firm that is an "eligible guarantor institution" (as
defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act); _provided_ , that such
Company Stock Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the
time set forth in such guarantee of delivery);or (ii) in the case of book-
entry shares, any additional documents required by the procedures set forth in
the Form of Election. After a Cash Election, a Share Election or a Mixed
Election is properly made with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock,
no further registration of transfers of such shares of Company Common Stock
shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Company, unless and until
such Cash Election, Share Election or Mixed Election is properly revoked.

 



 

(d) Acquiror and the Company shall publicly announce the anticipated Election
Deadline at least three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated Election
Deadline. If the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election
Deadline may, upon mutual agreement of Acquiror and the Company, be similarly
delayed to a subsequent date, and Acquiror and the Company shall promptly
announce any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled Election
Deadline.

 



 

(e) Any Cash Election, Share Election or Mixed Election may be revoked with
respect to all or a portion of the shares of Company Common Stock subject
thereto by the holder who submitted the applicable Form of Election by written
notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In
addition, all Cash Elections, Share Elections and Mixed Elections shall
automatically be revoked if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms. If a Cash Election, Share Election or Mixed Election is revoked,
the shares as to which such election previously applied shall be treated as
Non-Electing Company Shares unless a contrary election is properly made by the
holder within the period during which elections are permitted to be made
pursuant to **Section 2.6**. Company Stock Certificates will not be returned
to holders in the event an election is revoked unless the holder so requests.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Form of Election, the
reasonable, good-faith determination of the Exchange Agent (or the joint
determination of Acquiror and the Company, in the event that the Exchange
Agent declines to make any such determination) shall be conclusive and binding
as to whether or not Cash Elections, Mixed Elections and Share Elections shall
have been properly made or revoked pursuant to this **Section 2.6** (and to
disregard any immaterial defects in the Forms of Election) and as to when Cash
Elections, Mixed Elections, Share Elections and revocations were received by
the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent (or Acquiror and the Company jointly,
in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to make the following
computation) shall also make all computations contemplated by **Section
2.1(a)**, and absent manifest error this computation shall be conclusive and
binding. The Exchange Agent may, with the written agreement of Acquiror
(subject to the consent of the Company, not to be unreasonably withheld), make
any rules as are consistent with this **Section 2.6 **for the implementation
of the Cash Elections, Mixed Elections and Share Elections provided for in
this Agreement as shall be necessary or desirable to effect these Cash
Elections, Mixed Elections and Share Elections. None of Acquiror, the Company
or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person of
any defect in a Form of Election.

all material respects with applicable Legal Requirements; and (ii) did not at
the time they were filed, after giving effect to any amendment thereto filed

information as of an earlier date.

 



 

(d) To the Knowledge of the Company, there has not been any event or
occurrence since January 1, 2015 that would result in a determination that the
Bank is not an eligible depository institution as defined in 12 C.F.R. §

complete and correct in all material respects and have been maintained in
accordance with the Companys business practices and all applicable Legal
Requirements, including the maintenance of an adequate system of internal
controls required by such Legal Requirements. The minute books of the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries fairly reflect the substance of events and
transactions included therein.

interbank credit facilities or any transaction by the Bank acting in a
fiduciary capacity or otherwise incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business;

purposes for which they are held as of the date of this Agreement; (vi) liens
or deposits in connection with workers compensation, unemployment insurance,

Exceptions** "). The Company and each of its Subsidiaries as lessee has the
right under valid and existing leases to occupy, use, possess and control any
and all of the respective property leased by it, and each such lease is valid
and without default thereunder by the lessee or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, the lessor. To the Knowledge of the Company, all buildings and
structures owned by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries lie wholly within
the boundaries of the real property owned or validly leased by it, and do not
encroach upon the property of, or otherwise conflict with the property rights
of, any other Person.

 



 

 **Section 3.10** _Loans; Loan Loss Reserve_.

 



 

(a) Each loan, loan agreement, note, lease or other borrowing agreement by the
Bank, any participation therein, and any guaranty, renewal or extension
thereof (the " **Company Loans** ") reflected as an asset on any of the
Company Financial Statements or reports filed with the Regulatory Authorities
is evidenced by documentation that is customary and legally sufficient in all
material respects and constitutes, to the Knowledge of the Company, the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the enforceability
thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally or equitable principles or doctrines.

 



 

(b) All Company Loans originated or purchased by the Bank were made or
purchased in accordance with the policies of the board of directors of the
Bank and in the Ordinary Course of Business of the Bank. The Banks interest
in all Company Loans is free and clear of any security interest, lien,
encumbrance or other charge, and, the Bank has complied in all material
respects with all Legal Requirements relating to such Company Loans. There has
been no default on, or forgiveness or waiver of, in whole or in part, any
Company Loan made to an executive officer or director of the Company or the
Bank or an entity controlled by an executive officer or director during the
three (3) years immediately preceding the date hereof.

collateral for such Company Loan or by any obligor of such Company Loan; or

director of the Bank or an entity controlled by an executive officer or
director.

 



 

(d) The Banks allowance for loan and lease losses reflected in the Company
Financial Statements (including footnotes thereto) was determined on the basis
of the Banks continuing review and evaluation of the portfolio of Company
Loans under the requirements of GAAP and Legal Requirements, was established
in a manner consistent with the Banks internal policies, and, in the
reasonable judgment of the Bank, was adequate in all material respects under
the requirements of GAAP and all Legal Requirements to provide for possible or
specific losses, net of recoveries relating to Company Loans previously
charged-off, on outstanding Company Loans.

 



 

(e) To the Knowledge of the Company: (i) none of the Company Loans is subject
to any material offset or claim of offset; and (ii) the aggregate loan
balances in excess of the Banks allowance for loan and lease losses are,
based on past loan loss experience, collectible in accordance with their terms

Company, threatened against the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Taxes
that they owe. No audit, examination or investigation related to Taxes paid or

conducted or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened by any Regulatory
Authority. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries are the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any Tax Return, and there are no liens
for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of the Companys
or its Subsidiaries assets.

 



      
 

 



 

Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries has executed an extension or waiver

income tax" within the meaning of Sections 6662, 6662A, 6011, 6111 or 6707A of

recipient as of the date hereof and (C) the form of award agreement pursuant
to which each such outstanding award was issued or otherwise granted.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth in **Section 3.12(b)** of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including possible
terminations of employment in connection therewith) will cause a payment,
vesting, increase or acceleration of benefits or benefit entitlements under
any Company Benefit Plan or any other increase in the liabilities of the
Company or any Subsidiary under any Company Benefit Plan as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No Company Benefit Plan provides
for payment of any amount which, considered in the aggregate with amounts
payable pursuant to all other Company Benefit Plans, would result in any
amount being non-deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of
Section 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

 



 

(c) Neither the Company nor any Company ERISA Affiliate sponsors, maintains,
administers or contributes to, or has ever sponsored, maintained, administered
or contributed to, or has, has had or, could have any liability with respect
to, (i) any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA), (ii)
any "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in Section 3(40) of
ERISA), or (iii) except as set forth on **Section 3.12(c)** of the Company
Disclosure Schedules, any self-insured plan (including any plan pursuant to
which a stop loss policy or contract applies). With respect to any Company
Benefit Plan that is a "multiple employer plan" (as described in Section
413(c) of the Code) or is provided by or through a professional employer
organization, such Company Benefit Plan complies in all respects with the
requirements of the Code and ERISA and neither the Company nor any of the
Company ERISA Affiliates has any liabilities other than the payment and/or
remittance of premiums and/or required contributions on behalf of enrolled
individuals. Neither the Company nor any of the Company ERISA Affiliates
sponsors, maintains, administers or contributes to, or has ever sponsored,
maintained, administered or contributed to, or has, has had or could have any
liability with respect to, any Company Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, or any tax-qualified
"defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA). No Company
Benefit Plan is underfunded when comparing the present value of accrued
liabilities under such plan to the market value of plan assets.

 



 

(d) Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401
and related provisions of the Code is the subject of a favorable determination
letter from the IRS to the effect that it is so qualified under the Code and
that its related funding instrument is tax exempt under Section 501 of the
Code (or the Company and its Subsidiaries are otherwise relying on an opinion
letter issued to the prototype sponsor), and, to the Companys Knowledge,
there are no facts or circumstances that would adversely affect the qualified
status of any Company Benefit Plan or the tax-exempt status of any related
trust.

 



 

(e) Each Company Benefit Plan is and has been administered in all material
respects in compliance with its terms and with all applicable Legal
Requirements.

 



 

(f) Other than routine claims for benefits made in the Ordinary Course of
Business, there is no litigation, claim or assessment pending or, to the
Companys Knowledge,

 



      
 

 



 

threatened by, on behalf of, or against any Company Benefit Plan or against
the administrators or trustees or other fiduciaries of any Company Benefit
Plan that alleges a violation of applicable state or federal law or violation
of any Company Benefit Plan document or related agreement.

 



 

(g) No Company Benefit Plan fiduciary or any other person has, or has had, any
liability to any Company Benefit Plan participant, beneficiary or any other
person under any provisions of ERISA or any other applicable Legal Requirement
by reason of any action or failure to act in connection with any Company
Benefit Plan, including any liability by any reason of any payment of, or
failure to pay, benefits or any other amounts or by reason of any credit or
failure to give credit for any benefits or rights. To the Companys Knowledge,
no disqualified person (as defined in Code Section 4975(e)(2)) of any Company
Benefit Plan has engaged in any nonexempt prohibited transaction (as described
in Code Section 4975(c) or ERISA Section 406).

 



 

(h) No Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Plan fiduciary has engaged in
any transaction involving Company Capital Stock with respect to which a
selling shareholder has made an election under Code Section 1042 and the
Company has consented under Code Section 1042 to the application of Code
Sections 4978 and 4979A.

 



 

(i) All accrued contributions and other payments to be made by the Company or
any Subsidiary to any Company Benefit Plan (i) through the date hereof have
been made or reserves adequate for such purposes have been set aside therefor
and reflected in Company Financial Statements and (ii) through the Closing
Date will have been made or reserves adequate for such purposes will have been
set aside therefore and reflected in the Company Financial Statements.

 



 

(j) Except as disclosed on **Section 3.12(j)** of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, there are no obligations under any Company Benefit Plans to provide
health or other welfare benefits to retirees or other former employees,
directors, consultants or their dependents (other than rights under Section
4980B of the Code or Section 601 of ERISA or comparable state laws).

 



 

(k) No event has occurred, or to the Companys Knowledge, circumstance exists
that could result in a material increase in premium costs of Company Benefit
Plans or a material increase in benefit costs of such Company Benefit Plans
that are self-insured as compared to the Companys fiscal year ended December
31, 2015.

 



 

(l) No condition exists as a result of which the Company or any Subsidiary
would have any liability, whether absolute or contingent, under any Company
Benefit Plan with respect to any misclassification of a person performing
services for the Company or any Subsidiary as an independent contractor rather
than as an employee. All individuals participating in Company Benefit Plans
are in fact eligible and authorized to participate in such Company Benefit
Plan.

 



 

(m) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have any liabilities to
employees or former employees that are not reflected in the Company Benefit
Plans.

 



      
 

 



 

(n) Each Company Benefit Plan may be amended, terminated or otherwise
discontinued as of the Closing Date in accordance with its terms without any
liability to Acquiror or to Acquiror ERISA Affiliates.

 **Section 3.17** _No Defaults_. Each Company Material Contract is in full
force and effect and is valid and enforceable against the Company, and to the
Companys Knowledge, against such other party to such Company Material
Contract, in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other Legal Requirements
affecting creditors rights generally and subject to general principles of
equity. To the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred or circumstance
exists that (with or without notice or lapse of time) may contravene, conflict
with or result in a material violation or breach of, or give the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or other Person the right to declare a default or exercise
any remedy under, or to accelerate the maturity or performance of, or to
cancel, terminate or modify, any Company Material Contract, except as listed
in **Section 3.10(c)** of the Company Disclosure Schedules or where any such
default would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except in the Ordinary Course
of Business with respect to any Company Loan, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has given to or received from any other Person, at any time
since January 1, 2015, any notice or other communication (whether oral or
written) regarding any actual, alleged, possible or potential violation or
breach of, or default under, any Company Material Contract, that has not been
terminated or satisfied prior to the date of this Agreement. Other than in the
Ordinary Course of Business, there are no renegotiations of, attempts to

 



      
 

 



 

renegotiate or outstanding rights to renegotiate, any material amounts paid or
payable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under current or completed
Company Material Contracts with any Person, and no such Person has made
written demand for such renegotiation.

 



 

 **Section 3.18** _Insurance_. **Section 3.18** of the Company Disclosure
Schedules lists all insurance policies and bonds owned or held as of the date
of this Agreement by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to their
respective business, operations, properties or assets (including bankers
blanket bond and insurance providing benefits for employees), true, complete
and correct copies of each of which have been delivered or made available to
Acquiror. The Company and its Subsidiaries are insured with reputable insurers
against such risks and in such amounts as the management of the Company
reasonably has determined to be prudent and consistent with comparable
entities engaged in the same business and industry. The Company and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with their insurance
policies and are not in default under any of the terms thereof. Each such
policy is outstanding and in full force and effect and, except for policies
insuring against potential liabilities of officers, directors and employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Company or the relevant Subsidiary
thereof is the sole beneficiary of such policies. All premiums and other
payments due under any such policy have been paid, and all claims thereunder
have been filed in due and timely fashion. **Section 3.18** of the Company
Disclosure Schedules lists and briefly describes all claims that have been
filed under such insurance policies and bonds within the past two (2) years
prior to the date of this Agreement that individually or in the aggregate
exceed $50,000 and the current status of such claims. None of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has had any insurance policy or bond cancelled or
nonrenewed by the issuer of the policy or bond within the past two (2) years.

 



 

 **Section 3.19** _Compliance with Environmental Laws_. There are no actions,
suits, investigations, liabilities, inquiries, Proceedings or Orders involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets that
are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor to the
Knowledge of the Company, is there any factual basis for any of the foregoing,
as a result of any asserted failure of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
of, or any predecessor thereof, to comply with any Environmental Law. No
environmental clearances or other governmental approvals are required for the
conduct of the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. To the Knowledge of the
Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is the owner of any
interest in real estate, other than OREO, on which any substances have been
generated, used, stored, deposited, treated, recycled or disposed of, which
substances if known to be present on, at or under such property, would require
notification to any Regulatory Authority, clean up, removal or some other
remedial action under any Environmental Law at such property or any impacted
adjacent or down gradient property, except where such action would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
Except for any matters that have not had, and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company has complied in all
material respects with all Environmental Laws applicable to it and its
business operations.

Stephens, Inc. pursuant to an engagement letter that has been Previously
Disclosed, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
Representatives, has incurred any obligation or liability, contingent or
otherwise, for brokerage or finders fees or agents commissions or other
similar payment in connection with this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 3.22** _Approval Delays_. To the Knowledge of the Company, there
is no reason why the granting of any of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals
would be denied or unduly delayed. The Banks most recent CRA rating was
"satisfactory" or better.

 



 

 **Section 3.23** _Labor Matters_.

 



 

(a) There are no collective bargaining agreements or other labor union
Contracts applicable to any employees of the Company or any of its

years. There are no organizational efforts with respect to the formation of a
collective bargaining unit presently being made, or to the Knowledge of the

is engaging in any unfair labor practice. The Company and its Subsidiaries are
in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements
respecting employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment, wages, hours of work and occupational safety and health. No
Proceeding asserting that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has committed
an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations
Act of 1935) or seeking to compel the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
bargain with any labor organization as to wages or conditions of employment is
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries before the National Labor Relations Board,
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any other Regulatory Authority.

 



 

(b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or
otherwise bound by, any consent decree with, or citation by, any Regulatory
Authority relating to employees or employment practices. None of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their executive officers has received
within the past three (3) years any written notice of intent by any Regulatory
Authority responsible for the enforcement of labor or employment laws to
conduct an investigation relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no such investigation is in progress.

 



 

 **Section 3.24** _Intellectual Property_. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has the unrestricted right and authority, and the Surviving
Entity and its Subsidiaries will have the unrestricted right and authority
from and after the Effective Time, to use all patents, trademarks,

 



      
 

 



 

copyrights, service marks, trade names or other intellectual property owned by
them as is necessary to enable them to conduct and to continue to conduct all
material phases of the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the
manner presently conducted by them, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, such
use does not, and will not, conflict with, infringe on or violate any patent,
trademark, copyright, service mark, trade name or any other intellectual
property right of any Person.

 



 

 **Section 3.25** _Investments_.

complete and correct list and description as of December 31, 2016, of: (i) all
investment and debt securities, mortgage-backed and related securities,
marketable equity securities and securities purchased under agreements to
resell that are owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries, other than, with
respect to the Bank, in a fiduciary or agency capacity (the " **Company
Investment Securities** "); and (ii) any such Company Investment Securities
that are pledged as collateral to another Person. The Company and each
Subsidiary has good and marketable title to all Company Investment Securities
held by it, free and clear of any liens, mortgages, security interests,
encumbrances or charges, except for Company Permitted Exceptions and except to
the extent such Company Investment Securities are pledged in the Ordinary
Course of Business consistent with prudent banking practices to secure
obligations of the Company or the Bank. The Company Investment Securities are
valued on the books of the Company and the Bank in accordance with GAAP.

 



 

(b) Except as may be imposed by applicable securities laws and restrictions
that may exist for securities that are classified as "held to maturity," none
of the Company Investment Securities is subject to any restriction, whether
contractual or statutory, that materially impairs the ability of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of such investment at any time. With
respect to all material repurchase agreements to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party, the Company or such Subsidiary of the Company, as
the case may be, has a valid, perfected first lien or security interest in the
securities or other collateral securing each such repurchase agreement, and
the value of the collateral securing each such repurchase agreement equals or
exceeds the amount of the debt secured by such collateral under such
agreement.

 



 

(c) None of the Company or its Subsidiaries has sold or otherwise disposed of
any Company Investment Securities in a transaction in which the acquiror of
such Company Investment Securities or other person has the right, either
conditionally or absolutely, to require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to repurchase or otherwise reacquire any such Company Investment Securities.

 



 

(d) All Derivative Transactions, whether entered into for the account of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for the account of a customer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, were entered into in the Ordinary Course
of Business and in accordance with prudent banking practice and applicable
Legal Requirements of applicable Regulatory Authorities and in accordance with
the investment, securities, commodities, risk management and other policies,
practices and procedures employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
with counterparties believed at the time to be financially responsible and
able to understand

 



      
 

 



 

(either alone or in consultation with their advisers) and to bear the risks of
such Derivative Transactions. All of such Derivative Transactions are legal,
valid and binding obligations of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries
enforceable against it in accordance with their terms (except as may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally and subject to general principles
of equity), and are in full force and effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries
have duly performed their obligations under the Derivative Transactions to the
extent that such obligations to perform have accrued and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, there are no breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or
assertions of such by any party thereunder.

 



 

 **Section 3.26** _Fiduciary Accounts; Investment Management Activities_
**.** Each of the Company, the Bank and their Subsidiaries have properly
administered all accounts for which it acts as fiduciary, including accounts
for which it serves as trustee, agent, custodian or investment advisor, in
accordance with the terms of the governing documents and applicable Legal
Requirements. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company, the Bank,
nor any of their Subsidiaries or any of their directors, officers or employees
has committed any breach of trust with respect to any such fiduciary account,
and the accountings for each such fiduciary account are true and correct in
all respects and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.
Except as set forth in **Section 3.26** of the Company Disclosure Schedules,
none of the Company, the Bank, nor any of their Subsidiaries or the Companys,

(a) Except for the representations and warranties made by the Company in this
**Article 3**, neither the Company nor any other Person makes any express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company, its
Subsidiaries, or their respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities,
conditions (financial or otherwise) or prospects, and the Company hereby
disclaims any such other representations or warranties. In particular, without
limiting the foregoing disclaimer, neither the Company nor any other Person

 **Section 4.7** _Acquiror SEC Reports; Financial Statements and Reports;
Regulatory Filings_.

 



 

(a) Acquiror has timely filed all Acquiror SEC Reports, except where the
failure to file any Acquiror SEC Report, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Acquiror, and all such Acquiror SEC Reports complied as to form in all
material respects, as of their respective filing dates and effective dates, as
the case may be, with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder which are applicable to the Acquiror. The Acquiror SEC Reports were
prepared in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements in all material
respects. As of their respective filing dates, none of the Acquiror SEC
Reports contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except that information filed as of a later date (but before
the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify information as of an earlier
date. As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding comments from or
unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the Acquiror SEC
Reports. No Subsidiary of Acquiror is required to file periodic reports with
the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) The financial statements presented (or incorporated by reference) in the
Acquiror SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable) have been
prepared in conformity with GAAP, except in each case as indicated in such
statements or the notes thereto, and comply in all material respects with all
applicable Legal Requirements, including the maintenance of an adequate system
of internal controls. Taken together, the financial statements presented in
the Acquiror SEC Reports (collectively, the " **Acquiror Financial
Statements** ") are complete and correct in all material respects and fairly
and accurately present the respective financial position, assets, liabilities
and results of operations of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries at the respective
dates of and for the periods referred to in the Acquiror Financial Statements,
subject to normal year-end audit adjustments in the case of unaudited Acquiror
Financial Statements. As of the date hereof, RSM US LLP has not resigned (or
informed Acquiror that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent
registered public accountants of Acquiror.

 



 

(c) Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all forms, reports and
documents required to be filed since January 1, 2015, with all applicable
federal or state securities or banking authorities except to the extent
failure would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries. Such forms, reports and documents: (i) complied as to form in
all material respects with applicable Legal Requirements; and (ii) did not at
the time they were filed, after giving effect to any amendment thereto filed
prior to the date hereof, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a
later date (but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify
information as of an earlier date.

 



 

(d) To the Knowledge of Acquiror, there has not been any event or occurrence
since January 1, 2015 that would result in a determination that Acquiror Bank
is not an eligible depository institution as defined in 12 C.F.R. § 303.2(r).

 



 

 **Section 4.8** _Books and Records_. The books of account, minute books,
stock record books and other records of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries are
complete and correct in all material respects and have been maintained in
accordance with Acquirors business practices and all applicable Legal
Requirements, including the maintenance of an adequate system of internal
controls required by such Legal Requirements. The minute books of Acquiror and
each of its Subsidiaries fairly reflect the substance of events and
transactions included therein.

 



 

 **Section 4.9** _Loan Loss Reserve_.

 



 

(a) Acquiror Banks allowance for loan and lease losses reflected in the
Acquiror Financial Statements (including footnotes thereto) was determined on
the basis of Acquiror Banks continuing review and evaluation of the portfolio
of each loan, loan agreement, note, lease or other borrowing agreement by
Acquiror Bank, any participation therein, and any guaranty, renewal or
extension thereof (the " **Acquiror Loans** ") under the requirements of GAAP
and Legal Requirements, was established in a manner consistent with Acquiror
Banks internal policies, and, in the reasonable judgment of Acquiror Bank,
was adequate in all material respects under the requirements of GAAP and all
Legal Requirements to provide for possible or specific losses, net of
recoveries relating to Acquiror Loans previously charged-off, on outstanding
Acquiror Loans.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) To the Knowledge of Acquiror: (i) none of the Acquiror Loans is subject to
any material offset or claim of offset; and (ii) the aggregate loan balances
in excess of Acquiror Banks allowance for loan and lease losses are, based on
past loan loss experience, collectible in accordance with their terms (except
as limited above) and all uncollectible loans have been charged off.

 



 

 **Section 4.10** _Taxes_.

 



 

(a) Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries have duly and timely filed (taking
into account all applicable extensions) all Tax Returns required to be filed
by them, and each such Tax Return was true, correct and complete in all
material respects when filed. Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries have paid,
or made adequate provision for the payment of, all Taxes (whether or not
reflected in Tax Returns as filed or to be filed) due and payable by Acquiror
and each of its Subsidiaries, or claimed to be due and payable by any
Regulatory Authority, and are not delinquent in the payment of any Tax, except
such Taxes as are being contested in good faith and as to which adequate
reserves have been provided.

 



 

(b) There is no claim or assessment pending or, to the Knowledge of Acquiror,
threatened against Acquiror and its Subsidiaries for any Taxes that they owe.
No audit, examination or investigation related to Taxes paid or payable by
Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries is presently being conducted or, to the
Knowledge of Acquiror, threatened by any Regulatory Authority. Neither
Acquiror nor its Subsidiaries are the beneficiary of any extension of time
within which to file any Tax Return, and there are no liens for Taxes (other
than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of Acquirors or its
Subsidiaries assets. Neither Acquiror nor its Subsidiaries has executed an
extension or waiver of any statute of limitations on the assessment or
collection of any Tax that is currently in effect.

 



 

(c) Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries have delivered or made available to
the Company true, correct and complete copies of all Tax Returns relating to
income taxes and franchise taxes owed by Acquiror and its Subsidiaries with
respect to the last three (3) fiscal years.

 



 

(d) To the Knowledge of Acquiror, Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries have
not engaged in any transaction that could materially affect the Tax liability
for any Tax Returns not closed by applicable statute of limitations: (i) which
is a "reportable transaction" or a "listed transaction" or (ii) a "significant
purpose of which is the avoidance or evasion of U.S. federal income tax"
within the meaning of Sections 6662, 6662A, 6011, 6111 or 6707A of the Code or
of the regulations of the U.S. Department of the Treasury promulgated
thereunder or pursuant to notices or other guidance published by the IRS
(irrespective of the effective dates).

 



 

 **Section 4.11** _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (including possible terminations of
employment in connection therewith) will cause a payment, vesting, increase or
acceleration of benefits or benefit entitlements under any Acquiror Benefit
Plan or any other increase in the

 



      
 

 



 

liabilities of Acquiror or any Subsidiary under any Acquiror Benefit Plan as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) With respect to any Acquiror Benefit Plan that is a "multiple employer
plan" (as described in Section 413(c) of the Code) or is provided by or
through a professional employer organization, such Acquiror Benefit Plan
complies in all respects with the requirements of the Code and ERISA and
neither Acquiror nor any of the Acquiror ERISA Affiliates has any liabilities
other than the payment and/or remittance of premiums and/or required
contributions on behalf of enrolled individuals. Neither Acquiror nor any of
the Acquiror ERISA Affiliates sponsors, maintains, administers or contributes
to, or has ever sponsored, maintained, administered or contributed to, or has,
has had or could have any liability with respect to, any Acquiror Benefit Plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code,
or any tax-qualified "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of
ERISA). No Acquiror Benefit Plan is underfunded when comparing the present
value of accrued liabilities under such plan to the market value of plan
assets.

 



 

(c) Each Acquiror Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401
and related provisions of the Code is the subject of a favorable determination
letter, or, in the case of a volume submitter or prototype plan, an advisory
or sponsor letter, from the IRS to the effect that it is so qualified under
the Code and that its related funding instrument is tax exempt under Section
501 of the Code (or Acquiror and its Subsidiaries are otherwise relying on an
opinion letter issued to the prototype sponsor), and, to Acquirors Knowledge,
there are no facts or circumstances that would adversely affect the qualified
status of any Acquiror Benefit Plan or the tax-exempt status of any related
trust.

 



 

(d) Each Acquiror Benefit Plan is and has been administered in all material
respects in compliance with its terms and with all applicable Legal
Requirements.

 



 

(e) Other than routine claims for benefits made in the Ordinary Course of
Business, there is no litigation, claim or assessment pending or, to
Acquirors Knowledge, threatened by, on behalf of, or against any Acquiror
Benefit Plan or against the administrators or trustees or other fiduciaries of
any Acquiror Benefit Plan that alleges a violation of applicable state or
federal law or violation of any Acquiror Benefit Plan document or related
agreement.

 



 

(f) No Acquiror Benefit Plan fiduciary or any other person has, or has had,
any liability to any Acquiror Benefit Plan participant, beneficiary or any
other person under any provisions of ERISA or any other applicable Legal
Requirement by reason of any action or failure to act in connection with any
Acquiror Benefit Plan, including any liability by any reason of any payment
of, or failure to pay, benefits or any other amounts or by reason of any
credit or failure to give credit for any benefits or rights. To Acquirors
Knowledge, no disqualified person (as defined in Code Section 4975(e)(2)) of
any Acquiror Benefit Plan has engaged in any nonexempt prohibited transaction
(as described in Code Section 4975(c) or ERISA Section 406).

 



 

(g) All accrued contributions and other payments to be made by Acquiror or any
Subsidiary to any Acquiror Benefit Plan have been made or reserves adequate
for such purposes will have been set aside therefore and reflected in the
Acquiror Financial Statements.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) No condition exists as a result of which Acquiror or any Subsidiary would
have any liability, whether absolute or contingent, under any Acquiror Benefit
Plan with respect to any misclassification of a person performing services for
Acquiror or any Subsidiary as an independent contractor rather than as an
employee. All individuals participating in Acquiror Benefit Plans are in fact
eligible and authorized to participate in such Acquiror Benefit Plan.

 



 

(i) Neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries have any liabilities to
employees or former employees that are not reflected in the Acquiror Benefit
Plans.

 



 

 **Section 4.12** _Compliance with Legal Requirements_. Acquiror and each of
its Subsidiaries hold all material licenses, certificates, permits, franchises
and rights from all appropriate Regulatory Authorities necessary for the
conduct of their respective businesses as presently conducted. Acquiror and
each of its Subsidiaries is, and at all times since January 1, 2015, has been,
in compliance with each Legal Requirement that is or was applicable to it or
to the conduct or operation of its respective businesses or the ownership or
use of any of its respective assets (including, but not limited, to
Environmental Laws), except where noncompliance would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Acquiror. Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror, neither Acquiror nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received, at any time since January 1, 2015, any
notice or other communication (whether oral or written) from any Regulatory
Authority or any other Person regarding: (a) any actual, alleged, possible, or
potential violation of, or failure to comply with, any Legal Requirement; or
(b) any actual, alleged, possible, or potential obligation on the part of
Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries to undertake, or to bear all or any
portion of the cost of, any remedial action of any nature in connection with a
failure to comply with any Legal Requirement.

 



 

 **Section 4.13** _Legal Proceedings; Orders_.

 



 

(a) Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror, neither Acquiror nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of Acquiror, threatened, Proceedings against Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries. There is no Order imposed on Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries
that would reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. No officer, director, employee or agent of
Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any Order that prohibits
such officer, director, employee or agent from engaging in or continuing any
conduct, activity or practice relating to the businesses of Acquiror or any of
its Subsidiaries as currently conducted.

 



 

(b) Neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries: (i) is subject to any cease
and desist or other Order or enforcement action issued by; (ii) is a party to
any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with;
(iii) is a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to; (iv) is
subject to any order or directive by; (v) is subject to any supervisory letter
from; (vi) has been ordered to pay any civil money penalty, which has not been
paid, by; or (vii) has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions
at the request of; any Regulatory Authority that currently restricts in any
material respect the conduct of its business, in any manner relates to its
capital adequacy, restricts its ability to pay dividends or interest or limits
in any material manner its credit or risk management policies, its management
or its

 



      
 

 



 

business. To the Knowledge of Acquiror, none of the foregoing has been
threatened by any Regulatory Authority.

 



 

 **Section 4.14** _Absence of Certain Changes and Events_. Since December 31,
2015, no event or events have occurred that had or would reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Acquiror.

 



 

 **Section 4.15** _Brokerage Commissions_. Except for fees payable to Sandler
ONeill and Partners, L.P. pursuant to an engagement letter that has been
Previously Disclosed, none of Acquiror or its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective Representatives, has incurred any obligation or liability,
contingent or otherwise, for brokerage or finders fees or agents commissions
or other similar payment in connection with this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 4.16** _Approval Delays_. To the Knowledge of Acquiror, there is
no reason why the granting of any of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals would
be denied or unduly delayed. Acquiror Banks most recent CRA rating was
"satisfactory" or better.

 



 

 **Section 4.17** _Financial Capability_. Acquiror has, and will have prior
to the Effective Time, sufficient funds to pay the cash component of the
Common Stock Merger Consideration and to perform its other obligations
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 4.18** _No Other Representations or Warranties_.

 



 

(a) Except for the representations and warranties made by Acquiror in this
**Article 4**, neither Acquiror nor any other Person makes any express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to Acquiror, its Subsidiaries,
or their respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions
(financial or otherwise) or prospects, and Acquiror hereby disclaims any such
other representations or warranties. In particular, without limiting the
foregoing disclaimer, neither Acquiror nor any other Person makes or has made
any representation or warranty to the Company or any of its Affiliates or
representatives with respect to: (i) any financial projection, forecast,
estimate, budget or prospective information relating to Acquiror, any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses; or (ii) except for the
representations and warranties made by Acquiror in this **Article 4**, any
oral or written information presented to the Company or any of its Affiliates
or representatives in the course of their due diligence investigation of
Acquiror, the negotiation of this Agreement or in the course of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor any other
Person has made or is making any express or implied representation or warranty
other than those contained in **Article 3**.

Representatives attorneys responses to auditors requests for information
regarding the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and such
financial and operating data and other information reasonably requested by
Acquiror (provided, such disclosure would not result in the waiver by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any claim of attorney-client privilege).

representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement. This
**Section 5.1(a)** shall not require the disclosure of any information to
Acquiror the disclosure of which, in the Companys reasonable judgment: (i)
would be prohibited by any applicable Legal Requirement; (ii) would result in
the breach of any agreement with any third party in effect on the date of this
Agreement; or (iii) relate to pending or threatened litigation or
investigations, if disclosure might affect the confidential nature of, or any
privilege relating to, the matters being discussed. If any of the restrictions

members of such committees in connection with all meetings of the board of

Subsidiaries; in each case other than portions of such documents: (i) relating
to confidential supervisory or examination materials, (ii) the disclosure of
which would violate any applicable Legal Requirement, (iii) the disclosure of
which would, in the reasonable judgment of the Companys outside counsel,
result in the waiver of the attorney-client privilege, or (iv) related to an
Acquisition Proposal (disclosure of which shall be governed solely by
**Section 5.8**).

 



      
 

 



 

(d) All information obtained by Acquiror in accordance with this **Section

has provided Acquiror with information sufficient for Acquiror to make an

Acquiror of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that: (a) is
reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events

this Agreement and unless there has been a Company Adverse Recommendation, the
Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date the
Registration Statement is declared effective, take all action necessary,
including as required by and in accordance with the IBCA, Company Articles of

Recommendation** "). However, if, prior to the time the Company Stockholder
Approval is obtained, the Company Board, after consultation with outside
counsel, determines in good faith it is reasonably likely that to, or to
continue to, recommend this Agreement to its stockholders would result in a
violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Legal Requirements, then
the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation or publicly
propose or resolve to make a Company Adverse Recommendation.

time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, not be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to
correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to the
solicitation of any proxy for the meeting in connection with which the Proxy
Statement shall be mailed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall
have no responsibility for the truth or accuracy of any information with
respect to Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates

appropriate operating functions to be effective at the Effective Time or such
later date as the parties may mutually agree; including, to the extent
necessary, by providing notices and other documentation to all insurance

Effective Time.

(a) The Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any Persons other than Acquiror with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company will within two (2) Business Days advise Acquiror
following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof
(including the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal), and
will keep Acquiror apprised of any related developments, discussions and
negotiations (including the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition
Proposal) on a reasonably current basis.

 



 

(b) The Company agrees that it will not, and will cause its respective
Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries officers, directors, agents,
advisors and affiliates not to, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly
facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in any
negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information
or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to, any
Acquisition Proposal (other than contacting a Person for the sole purpose of
seeking clarification of the terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal); _provided_ that, in the event the Company receives an unsolicited
bona fide Acquisition Proposal from a Person other than Acquiror after the
execution of this Agreement, and the Company Board concludes in good faith
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or would
reasonably be likely to result in a Superior Proposal and, after considering
the advice of outside counsel, that failure to take such actions would be
reasonably likely to result in a violation of the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Legal Requirements, the Company may: (i) furnish information
with respect to it to such Person making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
a customary confidentiality agreement (subject to the requirement that any
such information not previously provided to Acquiror shall be promptly
furnished to Acquiror); (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding such Acquisition Proposal; and (iii) terminate this Agreement in
order to concurrently enter into an agreement with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this **Section 5.8** unless and until (x) five (5)
Business Days have elapsed following the delivery to the other party of a
written notice of such determination by the Company Board and, during such
five (5) Business-Day period, the parties cooperate with one another with the
intent of enabling the parties to engage in good faith negotiations so that
the Contemplated Transactions may be effected, and (y) at the end of such five
(5) Business-Day period, the Company continues, in good faith and after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, to believe
that a Superior Proposal continues to exist.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 6 
ACQUIRORS COVENANTS**

 



 

 **Section 6.1** _Access and Investigation_.

 



 

(a) Subject to any applicable Legal Requirement, the Company and its
Representatives shall, at all times during normal business hours and with
reasonable advance notice, have such reasonable access to the facilities,
operations, records and properties of

 



      
 

 



 

Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries in accordance with the provisions of
this **Section 6.1(a)** as shall be necessary for the purpose of determining
Acquirors continued compliance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. The Company and its Representatives may, during such period, make
or cause to be made such reasonable investigation of the operations, records
and properties of Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries and of their
respective financial and legal conditions as Company shall deem necessary or
advisable to familiarize itself with such records, properties and other
matters; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access or investigation shall not
interfere materially with the normal operations of Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries. Upon request, Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries will furnish
the Company or its Representatives attorneys responses to auditors requests
for information regarding Acquiror or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and
such financial and operating data and other information reasonably requested
by the Company (provided, such disclosure would not result in the waiver by
Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries of any claim of attorney-client
privilege). No investigation by the Company or any of its Representatives
shall affect the representations and warranties made by Acquiror in this
Agreement. This **Section 6.1(a)** shall not require the disclosure of any
information to the Company the disclosure of which, in Acquirors reasonable
judgment: (i) would be prohibited by any applicable Legal Requirement; (ii)
would result in the breach of any agreement with any third party in effect on
the date of this Agreement; or (iii) relate to pending or threatened
litigation or investigations, if disclosure might affect the confidential
nature of, or any privilege relating to, the matters being discussed. If any
of the restrictions in the preceding sentence shall apply, Acquiror and the
Company will make appropriate alternative disclosure arrangements, including
adopting additional specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of
sensitive material and to ensure compliance with any applicable Legal
Requirement.

 



 

(b) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Acquiror shall
promptly furnish to the Company: (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed, furnished or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal and state banking
laws or federal or state securities laws, which is not generally available on
the SECs EDGAR internet database; and (ii) a copy of each report filed by it
or any of its Subsidiaries with any Regulatory Authority; in each case other
than portions of such documents relating to confidential supervisory or
examination materials or the disclosure of which would violate any applicable
Legal Requirement.

 



 

(c) All information obtained by the Company in accordance with this **Section
6.1** shall be treated in confidence as provided in the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 6.2** _Operation of Acquiror and Acquiror Subsidiaries_.

 



 

(a) Except as Previously Disclosed, as expressly contemplated by or permitted
by this Agreement, as required by applicable Legal Requirements, or with the
prior written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to its terms, Acquiror shall not, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries not to: (i) take any action that is intended to or would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect or materially delay the ability of
Acquiror or the Company to obtain any of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals,
to perform its covenants and agreements under this Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

or to consummate the Contemplated Transactions; (ii) amend the Acquiror
Articles of Incorporation or the Acquiror Bylaws, or similar governing
documents of any of its Subsidiaries, in a manner that would materially and
adversely affect the benefits of the Merger to the stockholders of the
Company; or (iii) agree to take, make any commitment to take, or adopt any
resolutions of Acquiror Board in support of, any of the actions prohibited by
this **Section 6.2**.

 



 

 **Section 6.3** _Information Provided to the Company_. Acquiror agrees that
the information concerning Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided or to be provided by Acquiror to the Company for inclusion or that is
included in the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement and any other
documents to be filed with any Regulatory Authority in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions will: (a) at the respective times such documents are
filed and, in the case of the Registration Statement, when it becomes
effective and, with respect to the Proxy Statement, when mailed, not be false
or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (b) in the case
of the Proxy Statement or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, not be
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any
material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication
with respect to the solicitation of any proxy for the meeting in connection
with which the Proxy Statement shall be mailed. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Acquiror shall have no responsibility for the truth or accuracy of any
information with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their Affiliates contained in the Registration Statement or in any document
submitted to, or other communication with, any Regulatory Authority.

 



 

 **Section 6.4** _Operating Functions_. Acquiror and Acquiror Bank shall
cooperate with the Company and the Bank in connection with planning for the
efficient and orderly combination of the parties and the operation of the Bank
and Acquiror Bank, and in preparing for the consolidation of the banks
appropriate operating functions to be effective at the Effective Time or such
later date as the parties may mutually agree.

 



 

 **Section 6.5** _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal
Requirements, each current or former director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or fiduciary of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any Company Benefit Plans or any Person who is or was
serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, trustee or employee of another Person (each, an "
**Indemnified Party** "), and any Person who becomes an Indemnified Party
between the date hereof and the Effective Time, against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, including the Contemplated Transactions,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time. Acquiror
shall also advance expenses incurred by an Indemnified Party in each such case
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, subject to
the receipt of an undertaking from such Indemnified Party to repay such
advanced expenses if it is determined by a final and nonappealable judgment

 



      
 

 



 

of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party was not
entitled to indemnification hereunder.

 



 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time or, if such term
coverage is not available, such other maximum period of coverage available,
Acquiror shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance covering each Person currently covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that in no event
shall Acquiror be required to expend annually in the aggregate an amount in
excess of 250% of the amount of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company for
the current policy term for such purpose and, if Acquiror is unable to
maintain such policy (or substitute policy) as a result of this proviso,
Acquiror shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is available and for as
long a period of time as is available following the Effective Time by payment
of such amount; _provided further_ , that: (i) Acquiror may substitute
therefor "tail" policies the material terms of which, including coverage and
amount, are no less favorable in any material respect to such directors and
officers than the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof; or (ii)
the Company may obtain such extended reporting period coverage under the
Companys existing insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective
Time).

 



 

(c) If Acquiror or any of its successors or assigns shall: (i) consolidate
with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii)
transfer all or substantially all its properties and assets to any Person;
then, and in each such case, Acquiror shall cause proper provision to be made
so that the successor and assign of Acquiror assumes the obligations set forth
in this **Section 6.5**.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this **Section 6.5** shall survive consummation of the
Merger and the Bank Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will
be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her
legal representatives.

 



 

 **Section 6.6** _Board Representation_. Subject to any necessary approval by
the appropriate Regulatory Authorities, Acquiror shall take all appropriate
action, subject to and in accordance with the respective bylaws of Acquiror
and Acquiror Bank, to appoint one individual serving on the Company Board and
mutually agreeable to the parties to the board of directors of Acquiror Bank,
effective immediately upon the effectiveness of the Bank Merger.

 



 

 **Section 6.7** _Authorization and Reservation of Acquiror Common Stock_.
The Acquiror Board shall, as of the date hereof, authorize and reserve the
maximum number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued pursuant to
this Agreement and take all other necessary corporate action to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

 **Section 6.8** _Stock Exchange Listing_. Acquiror shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause all shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable or to be
reserved for issuance under this Agreement to be approved for listing on the
NASDAQ Global Select Market prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

 **Section 6.9** _Assumption of Debt Instruments_. Acquiror agrees to execute
and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of the
Surviving Entity, at or prior to the

 



      
 

 



 

Effective Time, one or more supplemental indentures, guarantees, and other
instruments required for the due assumption of the Companys outstanding debt,
subordinated debentures, guarantees, securities, and other agreements to the
extent required by the terms of such debt, subordinated debentures,
guarantees, securities, and other agreements.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 7 
COVENANTS OF ALL PARTIES**

 



 

 **Section 7.1** _Regulatory Approvals_. Acquiror and the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries will cooperate and use all reasonable best efforts to
as promptly as possible prepare, but in no event later than twenty-one (21)
days following the date hereof, file, effect and obtain all Requisite
Regulatory Approvals, and the parties will comply with the terms of such
Requisite Regulatory Approvals. Each of Acquiror and the Company will have the
right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult
with the other, in each case subject to applicable Legal Requirements relating
to the exchange of information, with respect to all substantive written
information submitted to any Regulatory Authority in connection with the
Requisite Regulatory Approvals. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the
parties will act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party agrees
that it will consult with the other party with respect to obtaining all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all Regulatory Authorities
necessary or advisable to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, and each
party will keep the other party apprised of the status of material matters
relating to completion of the Contemplated Transactions. Acquiror and the
Company will, upon request, furnish the other party with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with any filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of such other
party or any of its Subsidiaries with or to any Regulatory Authority in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

 **Section 7.2** _SEC Registration_. As soon as practicable following the
date of this Agreement, but in no event later than forty-five (45) days
following the date hereof, the Company and Acquiror shall prepare and file
with the SEC the Proxy Statement and Acquiror shall prepare and file with the
SEC the Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement will be included.
Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration Statement effective
as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the Contemplated
Transactions. Prior to the filing of the Registration Statement, Acquiror
shall consult with the Company with respect to such filing and shall afford
the Company and its representatives reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon. The Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement shall
include all information reasonably requested by the Company to be included.
The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement
to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after
the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act.
Acquiror shall also take any action required to be taken under any applicable
Legal Requirement in connection with the Acquiror Stock Issuance, and each
party shall furnish all information concerning itself and its stockholders as
may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Acquiror will
advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time
when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, the issuance of

 



      
 

 



 

any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of Acquiror Capital Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC to amend the Proxy Statement or the
Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests
by the SEC for additional information. The parties shall use reasonable best
efforts to respond (with the assistance of the other party) as promptly as
practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. If prior to the
Effective Time any event occurs with respect to the Company, Acquiror or any
Subsidiary of the Company or Acquiror, respectively, or any change occurs with
respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the Company or Acquiror,
respectively, for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement that, in each case, is required to be described in an amendment of,
or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement, the
Company or Acquiror, as applicable, shall promptly notify the other of such
event (including, prior to entering into any agreement providing for any
merger, consolidation, amalgamation, share exchange, business combination,
issuance of securities, acquisition of securities, tender offer, exchange
offer or other similar transaction involving Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries), and the Company or Acquiror, as applicable, shall cooperate in
the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement and, as required by applicable
Legal Requirements, in disseminating the information contained in such
amendment or supplement to the Companys stockholders and to Acquirors
stockholders. Acquiror shall take all action (other than qualifying to do
business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified) required to
be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or
state securities or "blue sky" Legal Requirements and the rules and
regulations thereunder in connection with the Merger and the issuance of
Acquiror Common Stock in connection with the Common Stock Merger
Consideration.

 



 

 **Section 7.3** _Publicity_. Neither the Company nor Acquiror shall, and
neither the Company nor Acquiror shall permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any public statement or,
except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, any disclosure of
nonpublic information to a third party, concerning, the Contemplated
Transactions without the prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) of Acquiror, in the case of a proposed announcement,
statement or disclosure by the Company, or the Company, in the case of a
proposed announcement, statement or disclosure by Acquiror; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that either party may, without the prior consent of the other
party (but after prior consultation with the other party to the extent
practicable under the circumstances), issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement to the extent required by
applicable Legal Requirements or by the NASDAQ Rules.

 



 

 **Section 7.4** _Reasonable Best Efforts; Cooperation_. Each of Acquiror and
the Company agrees to exercise good faith and use its reasonable best efforts
to satisfy the various covenants and conditions to Closing in this Agreement,
and to consummate the Contemplated Transactions as promptly as practicable.
Neither Acquiror nor the Company will intentionally take or intentionally
permit to be taken any action that would be a breach of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, each of Acquiror and the Company will, and will cause each
Subsidiary of Acquiror and the Company, respectively, and all of their
respective Affiliates and Representatives to, cooperate with respect to all
filings that any party is required by any applicable Legal Requirements to
make in connection with the

 



      
 

 



 

Contemplated Transactions. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements and the
instructions of any Regulatory Authority, each party shall keep the other
party reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion
of the Contemplated Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other
party with copies of notices or other written communications received by it or
any of its Subsidiaries from any Regulatory Authority with respect to such
transactions.

 



 

 **Section 7.5** _Tax Free Reorganization_.

 



 

(a) The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a nontaxable reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) and related sections of the Code and that
this Agreement constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 1.368-2(g) of the income tax regulations promulgated under the Code.
From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each
of the Company and Acquiror shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and
shall cause their Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts, to
cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, and will not knowingly take any action, cause any action
to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken
which action or failure to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the
Effective Time, neither Acquiror nor any Affiliate of Acquiror knowingly shall
take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action, or
cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act could
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. Within forty-five (45) days following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall comply with the reporting
requirements of Section 1.6045B-1(a)(2) of the Treasury Regulations. Each of
the Company and Acquiror shall report the Merger as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code on its United States federal income
Tax Return, unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

 



 

(b) As of the date hereof, the Company does not know of any reason: (i) why it
would not be able to deliver to counsel to the Company and counsel to
Acquiror, at the date of the legal opinions referred to in **Sections 8.8**
and **9.8** , certificates substantially in compliance with IRS published
advance ruling guidelines, with reasonable or customary exceptions and
modifications thereto (the " **IRS Guidelines** "), to enable counsel to
Acquiror and counsel to the Company to deliver the legal opinions contemplated
by **Sections 8.8** and **9.8** , respectively, and the Company hereby agrees
to deliver such certificates effective as of the date of such opinions; or
(ii) why counsel to the Company would not be able to deliver the opinion
required by **Section 9.8**. The Company will deliver such certificates to
counsel to the Company and counsel to Acquiror.

 



 

(c) As of the date hereof, Acquiror does not know of any reason: (i) why it
would not be able to deliver to counsel to Acquiror and counsel to the
Company, at the date of the legal opinions referred to in **Sections 8.8** and
**9.8** , certificates substantially in compliance with the IRS Guidelines, to
enable counsel to Acquiror and counsel to the Company to deliver the legal
opinions contemplated by **Sections 8.8** and **9.8** , respectively, and
Acquiror hereby agrees to deliver such certificates effective as of the date
of such opinions; or (ii) why counsel to Acquiror would not be able to deliver
the opinion required by **Section 8.8**. Acquiror will deliver such
certificates to counsel to Acquiror and counsel to the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 7.6** _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) All individuals employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing (" **Covered Employees** ") shall
automatically become employees of Acquiror as of the Closing. Following the
Closing, Acquiror shall maintain employee benefit plans and compensation
opportunities for the benefit of Covered Employees that provide employee
benefits and compensation opportunities that, in the aggregate, are
substantially comparable to the employee benefits and compensation
opportunities that are made available to similarly-situated employees of
Acquiror under the Acquiror Benefit Plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (i)
in no event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any
closed or frozen Acquiror Benefit Plan; and (ii) until such time as Acquiror
shall cause Covered Employees to participate in the Acquiror Benefit Plans, a
Covered Employees continued participation in Company Benefit Plans shall be
deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being
understood that participation in the Acquiror Benefit Plans may commence at
different times with respect to each Acquiror Benefit Plan).

 



 

(b) For the purpose of satisfying eligibility requirements and vesting periods
(but not for the purpose of benefit accruals) under the Acquiror Benefit Plans
providing benefits to the Covered Employees (the " **New Plans** "), each
Covered Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors to the same
extent as such Covered Employee was entitled to credit for such service under
any applicable Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Transition Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply
to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits
with respect to the same period of service.

 



 

(c) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of
the Transition Date, Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide that: (i) each Covered Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is similar in type to an applicable Company
Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was participating immediately
prior to the Transition Date (such Company Benefit Plans prior to the
Transition Date collectively, the " **Old Plans** "); (ii) for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or similar
benefits to any Covered Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan shall be waived for such
Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions
would not have been waived under the Old Plan in which such Covered Employee,
as applicable, participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior
to the Transition Date; and (iii) any eligible expenses incurred by such
Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the Transition Date shall be taken into
account under such New Plan to the extent such eligible expenses were incurred
during the plan year of the New Plan in which the Transition Date occurs for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Covered Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall take all actions necessary to
terminate the Companys severance policies immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Subject to the provisions of **Section 7.6(e)**, following the
Effective Time, Acquiror or Acquirors Subsidiary will cause any eligible
Company employee (exempt and non-exempt) to be covered by a severance policy
under which employees who incur a qualifying involuntary termination of
employment will be eligible to receive severance pay in accordance with the
severance pay schedule set forth on **Section 7.6(d)** of the Acquiror
Disclosure Schedules. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Company employee
eligible to receive severance benefits or other payment triggered by the
Merger under an employment, change in control, severance or other agreement (a
" **CIC Payment** ") shall be entitled to participate in the severance policy
described in this **Section 7.6(d)** or to otherwise receive severance
benefits. Any Company employee who waives and relinquishes his or her right to
a CIC Payment will be eligible for a severance payment as provided in this
**Section 7.6(d)**.

 



 

(e) Any Company employee who has or is party to any employment agreement,
severance agreement, change in control agreement or any other agreement or
arrangement that provides for a CIC Payment shall not receive any severance
benefits as provided in **Section 7.6(d)** but will receive the CIC Payment
to the extent it is required to be paid under such agreement, provided that,
on or before the Closing Date, the Company will take all steps necessary to
ensure that in the event that the amounts of the CIC Payment, either
individually or in conjunction with a payment or benefit under any other plan,
agreement or arrangement that is aggregated for purposes of Code Section 280G
(in the aggregate " **Total Payments** "), would constitute an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code that is
subject to the Tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then the amounts of
the CIC Payment shall be reduced such that the value of the Total Payments
that each counterparty is entitled to receive shall be $1.00 less than the
maximum amount which the counterparty may receive without becoming subject to
the excise tax or resulting in a disallowance of a deduction of the payment of
such amount under Section 280G of the Code.

 



 

 **Section 7.7** _Takeover Laws_. If any "moratorium," "control share," "fair
price," "affiliate transaction," "business combination" or other anti-takeover
Legal Requirement is or may become applicable to the Merger, the parties shall
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to (a) take such actions
as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereunder
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and (b) otherwise take all such actions as are reasonably
necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such Legal Requirement
on the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 7.8** _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
parties will each take such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause
any acquisitions or dispositions of Acquiror Common Stock resulting from the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by each
individual who may become or is reasonably expected to become subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
Acquiror immediately following the Effective Time, to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



       
 

 



 

 **Section 7.9** _Stockholder Litigation_. Each of the Company and Acquiror
shall give the other the reasonable opportunity to consult concerning the
defense of any stockholder litigation against the Company or Acquiror, as
applicable, or any of their respective directors or officers relating to the
Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

 **Section 7.10** _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of
Acquiror and the Company shall coordinate with the other regarding the
declaration of any dividends in respect of Acquiror Common Stock and Company
Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being
the intention of the parties hereto that holders of Company Common Stock shall
not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any month with
respect to their shares of Company Common Stock and any shares of Acquiror
Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.
Acquiror acknowledges that the Company has budgeted for, and will pay a cash
dividend of $2.25 per share of Company Common Stock during June, 2017.
Acquiror and the Company further acknowledge and agree that the Company shall
be permitted to make a pro rata dividend with respect to any month (or months)
that falls between July 1, 2017 and the month in which the Effective Time
occurs prior to the Closing (the " **Pre-Closing Dividend** ")", which,
consistent with the Companys budget, will be calculated based on a rate of
$0.50 per month and which, for the avoidance of doubt, each of the Company and
the Acquiror acknowledge is consistent with past practice and within the
Ordinary Course of Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that the calculation of
the Pre-Closing Dividend will disregard the month in which the Effective Time
occurs unless Acquiror has declared a record date during such month prior to
the Closing for the payment of an Acquiror dividend.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 8

matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.

warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
