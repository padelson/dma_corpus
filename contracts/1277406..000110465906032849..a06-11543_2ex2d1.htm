authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the

the valid and binding obligation of the Seller, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by

that jurisdiction. There are no Liens on any of the assets of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that arose in connection with any failure (or alleged

respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

4.7 _Compliance with Law_. Other than with respect to the Real Property
Assets, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all
Laws and Orders to which the business of the Company or such Subsidiary is
subject, except where such failure to comply would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Seller has not received any written notice to the
effect that any Real Property Asset is in violation of any Law, which
violation would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

4.8 _Real Property_.

  



  

(a) _Owned Real Property_. _Section 4.8(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_ contains a list of all real property owned by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (together with all improvements located therein and all
appurtenances related thereto, the " _Owned Real Property_ ", including all
Owned Real Property owned by ShopKo Parent SPE, LLC and its Subsidiaries the
" _ShopKo Real Property_ " and all Owned Real Property owned by Pamida Parent
SPE, LLC and its Subsidiaries the " _Pamida Real Property_ "). Except as set
forth in _Section 4.8(a)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_, the Company
or one of its Subsidiaries has fee title to each parcel of Owned Real
Property free and clear of all Liens, except Permitted Liens. Except as set
forth in _Section 4.8(a)(iii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_, none of
the Owned Real Property is the subject of any condemnation or eminent domain
proceeding and, to the Sellers Knowledge, there is no such proceeding
threatened by any Governmental Entity. Other than as set forth in _Section
4.8(a)(iv) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_, there are no (A) contracts or
other agreements to which the Company is a party granting, or proposing to
grant, to any party or parties the right to use or occupy any portion of the
Real Property

  



        
   

  



  

Assets and (B) no management agreements that affect the ShopKo Real Property
or the Pamida Real Property. Except as set forth in _Section 4.8(a)(v) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule_, there are no outstanding options or rights
of first refusal to purchase the ShopKo Real Property or the Pamida Real
Property (or any portions thereof or interests therein).

  



  

(b) _Leased Real Property_. _Section 4.8(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_ contains a list of all leases and subleases of real property under
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a ground lessee
(collectively, the " _Leases_ "), and identifies those Leases which will be
transferred and assigned to an Affiliate of Seller contemporaneously with the
Closing. The real property demised under any lease or sublease to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is referred to herein as the " _Leased Real
Property_ " and, together with the Owned Real Property, the " _Real Property
Assets_." The Seller has made available to the Purchaser a true and complete
copy of each Lease. Each such Lease is in full force and effect. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default in the performance,
observance or fulfillment of any obligation, covenant or condition contained
in any Lease, except where such default would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. No event has occurred which, with or without notice or lapse
of time or both, would cause a breach or default by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any of the Leases and, to the Sellers Knowledge, there is
no breach or anticipated breach by any other party to such Leases. The
representations and warranties contained in this Section 4.8 are the Sellers
sole representations and warranties with respect to real property and
interests therein.

  



  

4.9 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since October 29, 2005, there has
been no Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

4.10 _Litigation_. Except as set forth in _Section 4.10 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule_, there is no Action pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Seller, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that (a)
challenges or seeks to enjoin, alter or delay the consummation of the
Acquisition or the other transactions contemplated hereby, or (b) could
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Seller, there is no fact,
event or circumstance that may give rise to or serve as a basis for the
commencement of any such Action against the Company or any of the Real
Property Assets that could reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

  



  

4.11 _Restructuring Agreements_. Prior to the date hereof, the Seller
has provided to the Purchaser true and complete copies of the
Restructuring Agreements pursuant to which the Restructuring Transactions
have been completed. The Restructuring Agreements are valid and binding and
in full force and effect and neither the Company nor any other party thereto
is in violation thereof. The Restructuring Agreements validly assign, sell
and transfer all of the liabilities and all of the assets of the Company and
the Subsidiaries that are capable of assignment to the OpCos, except for the
Real Property Assets. There are no material contracts to which the Company
was a party immediately prior to completion of the Restructuring
Transactions, that have not

  



        
   

  



  

been so assigned to the OpCos, except (i) for those whose failure to be so
assigned could not reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect and (ii) as set forth in _Section 4.11 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule_.

  



  

4.12 _Ownership_. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any
stock or other equity interest in any corporation or other entity (other than
the Companys or a Subsidiarys ownership of all the outstanding stock or
equity interests of its Subsidiaries) nor pledged or assigned any stock or
other equity interests.

  



  

4.13 _Tangible Personal Property_. On the Closing Date, the cumulative fair
market value of the tangible personal property (as determined for purposes of
Section 856 of the Code) of the Company and its Subsidiaries will not exceed
$20,000,000. For these purposes, all tangible personal property associated
with (i) the Premises (as such term is defined in the Master Leases) or (ii)
Real Property Assets, platted outparcels and ground leases identified on
Section 6.1(a)(iii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule will be disregarded.

of the jurisdiction of its formation, has all requisite power to own, lease
and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the ownership,
leasing or holding of its properties makes such qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a material adverse
effect on the ability of the Purchaser to consummate the Acquisition and the
other transactions contemplated hereby (a " _Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect_ ").

  



  

5.2 _Authority and Enforceability_. The Purchaser has the requisite power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Acquisition and the
other transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Purchaser. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Purchaser and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Seller, constitutes the
valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting or relating to

  



        
   

  



  

creditors rights generally, and the availability of injunctive relief and
other equitable remedies.

  



  

5.3 _No Conflicts; Consents_.

  



  

(a) The execution and delivery by the Purchaser of this Agreement do not, and
the consummation by the Purchaser of the Acquisition and the other
transactions contemplated hereby will not, (i) violate the provisions of
the certificate of formation or limited liability company agreement of
the Purchaser, (ii) violate any Contract to which the Purchaser is a party,
or (iii) violate any Law or Order of any Governmental Entity applicable
to the Purchaser, except where such violation would not have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) No Authorization, Order of, registration, declaration or filing with, or
notice to any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or
with respect to the Purchaser in connection with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement or the consummation of the Acquisition or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, except for such Authorizations, Orders,
registrations, declarations, filings and notices the failure of which to
obtain would not have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

5.4 _Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of the
Purchaser, threatened against the Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof which
(a) challenges or seeks to enjoin, alter or delay the consummation of the
Acquisition or the other transactions contemplated hereby or (b) could
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Purchaser, there is no fact,

Purchaser to consummate the Acquisition. The ShopKo Loan Commitment is in
full force and effect as of the date hereof, and the obligations of Barclays
and Citigroup thereunder are not subject to any condition other than those
set forth therein. The Purchaser knows of no fact or circumstance that would
cause the Financing to be ineffective with respect to it, and has no reason,
as of the date hereof, to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing
contemplated by the ShopKo Loan Commitment within Purchasers control will
not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be made available to
Purchaser on the Closing Date.

the Company and meet with its officers and other representatives and (b) to
Purchasers knowledge, all materials and information requested by the

omissions from, the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

implied, except those representations and warranties of the Seller explicitly
set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate contemplated hereby and
delivered by the Seller in connection herewith. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Seller makes no representation or warranty
to the Purchaser with respect to: (a) any projections, estimates, forecasts
or budgets heretofore delivered to or made available to the Purchaser, or (b)
except as expressly covered by a representation or warranty contained in
Article III or IV, any other information or documents (financial or
otherwise) made available to the Purchaser, any Affiliate thereof or their
respective counsel, accountants or advisers, including in certain "data
rooms", management presentations, offering memoranda or in any other form in

Schedule were dated the date of the occurrence or discovery of any such fact
or condition, the Seller, or the Company, as applicable, shall promptly
deliver to the Purchaser a supplement to such Schedule specifying such change
(each such amendment or supplement, a " _Seller Disclosure Schedule

8.2 _Consents_. The Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents and waivers
with respect to the Acquisition may be required from parties to Contracts
to which the Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and
that such consents and waivers have not been obtained. The Purchaser agrees
that no representation, warranty or covenant of the Seller contained herein
shall be breached or deemed breached, and no condition shall be deemed not
satisfied, as a result of (a) the failure to obtain any such consent or
waiver, (b) any termination of a Contract as a result thereof or (c) any
Action commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of
or relating to the failure to obtain any such consent or any such
termination; it being understood, however, that the Purchaser may have rights

(c) above under the Restructuring Agreements and nothing in this Agreement is
intended to deprive or deny Purchaser any such rights, should they exist
under such agreements. After the Closing, the Company will, and will cause
each of its

  



        
   

  



  

Subsidiaries to, use its commercially reasonable efforts (at Sellers sole
cost and expense, to the extent costs to third parties are incurred) to
cooperate with the efforts of Seller, ShopKo OpCo and Pamida OpCo to obtain,
in writing, any consents to the Acquisition and to the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Restructuring Transactions,
that may be required from third parties; _provided_ , _however_ , in no event
will the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Purchaser be required to maintain
any licenses or keep in effect any agreements following the Closing Date.

  



  

8.3 _Public Announcements_. Neither the Purchaser nor the Seller nor any of
their respective Affiliates shall, without the approval of the other party,
such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, issue any press releases or

8.4 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Closing of Tax Year_. Purchaser and Seller agree that they intend that,
as a result of the Acquisition, the taxable year for federal and state (in

termination of the taxable year at such time) income tax purposes of the
Company will terminate at the close of the Closing Date (the " _Short Taxable
Year_ ").

  



  

(b) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns and Liability for Taxes_.

  



  

(i) Seller shall timely prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file, at
Sellers sole cost and expense, all Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and any entities as to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has become a successor prior to the Closing Date) with respect
to (A) Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, including, but not
limited to, the Short Taxable Year, and (B) all Straddle Periods, whether or
not such Tax Return is due prior to the Closing Date. Where a Tax Return
described in this Section 8.4(b)(i) is due more than 30 days following the
Closing Date, the Seller shall permit Purchaser and its designated
representative to review a draft of such Tax Return at least 15 days prior to
the date such Tax Return is to be filed and shall consider in good faith any
comments of Purchaser on such draft received by Seller within 10 days of its
provision of such draft Tax Return to Purchaser. Where a Tax Return described
in this Section 8.4(b)(i) is due 30 or fewer days following the Closing Date,
the Seller shall make reasonable efforts to provide Purchaser and its
designated representative with a meaningful opportunity to review a

  



         
  

  



  

draft of such Tax Return (which in no event shall require that Seller provide
a draft of such Tax Return to Purchaser more than 15 days prior to filing or
consider comments received from Purchaser more than 10 days after such draft
Tax Return has been provided to Purchaser) and shall consider in good faith
any timely comments of Purchaser on such draft. Purchaser shall cause an
appropriate officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, to execute the Tax Returns prepared by Seller pursuant to this
Section 8.4(b)(i); provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be required to
cause such execution to the extent that the Tax Return prepared by Seller
includes, and no Tax Return prepared by Seller pursuant to this Section
8.4(b)(i) shall be permitted to include, a position with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is not supported by applicable Tax
law. Seller agrees to reimburse Purchaser for all third party costs, up to an
aggregate amount of $10,000 of reimbursement pursuant to this sentence,
incurred by Purchaser in reviewing, prior to the filing thereof, of draft Tax
Returns provided by Seller pursuant to this Section 8.4(b)(i). Purchaser
shall, and following the Closing Date shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, provide Seller with such cooperation as Seller may
reasonably request in connection with obtaining an extension of the time for
filing any Tax Return described in this Section 8.4(b).

due with respect to: (A) Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, including but not limited to the Short Taxable Year, and (B) the

of Section 8.4(g), whether such Taxes are due as a result of filing a Tax
Return, the settlement of a Tax Controversy or otherwise, and that Purchaser
will be liable for and will timely pay all Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries due with respect to: (A) Tax periods beginning and ending after
the Closing Date and (B) the portion of the Straddle Period allocated to
Purchaser pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.4(g), whether such Taxes
are due as a result of filing a Tax Return, the settlement of a Tax
Controversy or otherwise; provided, however, if either party makes a payment
of Taxes that are the obligation of the other party pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 8.4(b)(ii), the party on whose behalf the payment
was made shall reimburse the paying party within 5 Business Days of receipt
of notice that such Taxes have been paid. Where Seller arranges for the
filing of a Tax Return for a Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date pursuant to Section 8.4(b)(i), Seller shall, except as otherwise
provided in this Section 8.4(b)(ii), pay the Tax liability shown on such Tax
Return. Where Seller arranges for the filing of a Tax Return for a Straddle
Period, Seller shall take reasonable steps to inform Purchaser of its share
(as determined under this Section 8.4) of the Tax liability reflected on such
Tax Return, and shall provide Purchaser with a detailed calculation of how
such share was determined, at least three Business Days prior to such filing,
and both Seller and Purchaser will pay their respective shares, as determined
under this Section 8.4 of such Tax liability. Purchaser, and not Seller,
shall be responsible under this Section 8.4 for and pay all Taxes of the
Company, its Subsidiaries and any consolidated, combined, unitary or similar
Tax group that includes the Company or any of its Subsidiaries resulting from
(i) any Section 481(a) adjustment (or any corresponding or similar adjustment
under foreign, state or local tax law) required

  



        
   

  



  

as a result of the Acquisition, (ii) any action taken by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries simultaneous with (if initiated by Purchaser or its
Affiliates) or after the Closing on the Closing Date that is outside the
ordinary course of business other than such an action which Seller has
consented to in a writing that refers to Section 11.2 hereof or (iii) any
breach by Purchaser of its covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

  



  

(c) _Cooperation With Respect to Tax Matters_.

  



  

(i) Seller and Purchaser each agree, following the Closing, to provide the
other party (and in the case of Purchaser, to cause its Affiliates, the
Company and the Companys Subsidiaries to provide Seller) with such
cooperation and information, as and to the extent reasonably requested, in
connection with the preparation, execution or filing of any Tax Return,
including any amended Tax Return and any claim for refund, the determination
of a liability for Taxes or of a right to a refund, in connection with the
conduct of any Tax Controversy, litigation or other proceeding with respect
to Taxes or in connection with any audit, suit or similar proceeding
described in Section 8.4(j)(v) hereof or relating to, or that may give rise
to an indemnity obligation under, Section 11.6(f) or Section 11.6(g) hereof.
Nothing in this Section 8.4(c)(i) shall limit Sellers control rights as
provided for in this Section 8.4.

  



  

(ii) Seller and Purchaser each agree that they shall, and Purchaser agrees
that following the Closing it shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries
to, (A) retain all books and records as are within their possession
immediately following the Closing with respect to Taxes of the Company and
its Subsidiaries relating to any Tax period beginning before the Closing Date
until the earlier of (1) the expiration of the statute of limitations (taking
into account applicable extensions) with respect to such Tax period or (2)
the eighth anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, however, that (a) upon
written notice from the other party prior to what would otherwise have been
the end of such retention period to the effect that such statute of
limitations (taking into account applicable extensions), will not have
expired on or prior to the date when the retention period would otherwise
have expired, such retention period shall be extended (subject to further
extension as set forth in this proviso) until the earlier to occur of (I) the
expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to such Tax period
(taking into account applicable extensions) and (II) the second anniversary
of the date on which such this retention period would otherwise have expired
and (b) a transfer of such books and records to another Person shall not be
prohibited hereunder provided that such other party agrees, for the benefit
of the non-transferring party to this Agreement, to comply with the
provisions of this Section 8.4(c)(ii) with respect to such books and records,
and (B) give the other party hereto reasonable access to such books and
records.

  



  

(d) _Payment of Transfer Taxes and Related Expenses_. The Purchaser and
Seller shall share equally and pay at Closing all Transfer Taxes imposed with
respect to the transfers provided for in this Agreement up to an aggregate
amount of such Transfer Taxes equal to $1.1 million and Seller shall be
responsible for any excess

  



        
   

  



  

Transfer Taxes imposed with respect to the transfers provided for in this
Agreement. The Seller, shall be responsible for timely preparing and filing
all necessary Tax Returns and documentation with respect to such Transfer
Taxes. The Purchaser shall provide the Seller with such cooperation as the
Seller may reasonably request in connection with the preparation, execution
and filing of such Tax Returns and documentation. The Seller shall make
reasonable efforts to provide Purchaser with a meaningful opportunity to
review such Tax Returns prior to filing and shall make such reasonable
changes to such Tax Returns as are timely requested by Purchaser. The cost
and expense associated with the preparation and filing of the Tax Returns
with respect to Transfer Taxes imposed with respect to the transfers provided
by this Agreement shall be shared equally by Purchaser and Seller. Where
either Purchaser or Seller has paid more than its share of such cost and
expense, the other party shall reimburse such party within 5 Business Days of
receipt of notice of such excess payment.

  



  

(e) _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. The Seller shall cause all Tax
sharing or Tax allocation agreements binding the Company or any Subsidiary to
be terminated no later than the day prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(f) _Refunds_. If Purchaser or its Affiliates (including, following the
Closing Date, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) receive, whether
through direct receipt of payment or through a credit or offset against Tax
liability for which Seller does not have an indemnification obligation under
Article XI hereof, any Tax refund that is attributable, under the principles
of Section 8.4(g) hereof, to a Pre-Closing Period, Purchaser shall, within
five (5) Business Days of such receipt, credit or offset, pay to Seller the
amount of such refund, credit or offset, but in the case of a credit or
offset, only to the extent the Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser
(including, following the Closing Date, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) has been able to use such credit or offset to reduce its actual
tax liability.

  



  

(g) _Allocation of Taxes for Straddle Periods_. Taxes imposed with respect to
a Tax period shall be treated as allocable to such Tax period. Taxes imposed
with respect to a Straddle Period shall be allocated between the portion of
such Straddle Period that constitutes a Pre-Closing Period and the portion
that constitutes a Post-Closing Period based on an interim closing of the
books; provided, however, that in the case of real property and ad valorem
Taxes the portion of such Taxes for a Straddle Period that are allocable to
the portion of such Straddle Period that constitutes a Pre-Closing Period
shall equal the product of (i) the amount of such taxes for the Straddle
Period and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in
the portion of such Straddle Period that is a Pre-Closing Period and the
numerator of which is the total number of days in such Straddle Period. A
payment of Tax (including estimated or similar Taxes) with respect to a
specified Tax period that results in a Tax refund or an offset or credit will
be treated as attributable to such Tax Period. Where such Tax Period is a
Straddle Period, the Tax liability for such Straddle Period shall be
allocated between the Pre-Closing Period and Post-Closing Period portions in
accordance with this Section 8.4(g) and the amount of Taxes treated as paid
(prior to the application of such refund, offset or credit) with respect to
the Pre-Closing Period included in such Straddle Period

  



        
   

  



  

shall equal the excess of (i) the sum of (x) the amounts of Taxes (including
estimated or similar Taxes) with respect to such Straddle Period paid on or
prior to the Closing Date and (y) the amounts paid by Seller hereunder with
respect to Taxes for such Straddle Period under this Agreement over (ii)
amounts previously received by Purchaser in respect of Tax refunds for such
Straddle Period under Section 8.4(f) hereof. Determinations of the Tax
periods or portions thereof to which Taxes are attributable or with respect
to which Taxes are imposed under this Section 8.4(g) shall be made on a basis
consistent with the provisions of Section 8.4(l) hereof.

  



  

(h) _Carrybacks_. Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall permit the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to carry any Tax item back from a Tax period
beginning after the Closing Date to a Tax period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date, without prior written notice to the other party and such other
partys consent with such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Neither
Seller nor Purchaser shall permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
carry any Tax item back from a Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date to an earlier Tax period without prior written notice to the other
party.

  



  

(i) _No Section 338 Election_. Purchaser agrees that it shall not make,
or permit to be made, an election under Section 338 of the Code, or
any corresponding or similar election under foreign, state or local law,
with respect to the transactions provided for in this Agreement.

  



  

(j) _Tax Controversy_. The Purchaser shall notify the Seller in writing
promptly upon learning of any audit, inquiry, examination or administrative
or judicial proceeding (a " _Tax Controversy_ ") that could result in a
determination of Tax liability for which Seller may have an indemnification
obligation hereunder. The Seller shall notify the Purchaser in writing
promptly upon learning of any Tax Controversy regarding Taxes related to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The failure to promptly provide notice
shall not relieve the party to which such notice was not promptly provided of
any liability it may have hereunder, except to the extent that the party to
which such notice was not promptly provided demonstrates actual prejudice as
a result of such failure.

  



  

(i) In the case of any Tax Controversy that could result in a determination
with respect to Taxes for which Seller may have an indemnification
obligation hereunder, the Seller shall have the right, at the Sellers sole
cost and expense, to control the conduct of such Tax Controversy. The Seller
shall keep the Purchaser reasonably informed of the progress of any such Tax
Controversy and, if it appears in the sole discretion of the Purchaser, that
such Tax Controversy may reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the successors thereto, the Purchaser
also may participate in such Tax Controversy (although Seller shall continue
to control such Tax Controversy). If the Seller does not assume the defense
of any such Tax Controversy, of which it has received notice from Purchaser,
the Purchaser may defend and settle the same in such manner as it may
reasonably deem appropriate, at the Sellers sole cost and expense, but shall
be required to keep Seller reasonably informed of the progress of such Tax
Controversy and Seller shall have the right to assume control of

  



        
   

  



  

such Tax Controversy at any time upon the provision of written notice of such
to Purchaser.

  



  

(ii) In the event that a potential Tax adjustment as to which the Seller may
have an indemnification obligation hereunder is present in the same
proceeding as a separate potential adjustment involving a different issue for
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may be liable and for which
Seller will not have any indemnification obligation under this Agreement, the
Seller shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to control the Tax
Controversy with respect to the former potential adjustment and the Purchaser
shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to control the Tax
Controversy with respect to the latter potential adjustment.

  



  

(iii) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.4(j)(i), where Purchaser is
permitted to participate in, defend or control a Tax Controversy under this
Section 8.4(j), it shall do so at its own cost and expense and it shall not
be permitted to take a position in such proceeding that is inconsistent with
the positions taken on the Tax Returns filed by or with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries for a Tax period beginning on or prior to the
Closing Date. Where inconsistent positions have been taken by the Company and
its Subsidiaries in Tax Returns with respect to Tax periods beginning on or
prior to the Closing Date, only the more recent of such positions shall be
taken into account for purposes of this Section 8.4(j)(iii).

  



  

(iv) The Purchaser shall provide and, if applicable, cause its Affiliates
(including, following the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries) to
provide such powers of attorney as are reasonably necessary to permit the
Seller to exercise the rights provided to it under this Section 8.4.

  



  

(v) Except where this Section 8.4 otherwise provides Seller with control over
such proceeding, in the case of any audit, suit or similar proceeding
relating to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, including Spirit Finance
Corporation and, following the Closing Date, the Company and its Affiliates,
that may establish that there has been a breach of a representation or
warranty set forth in Section 4.6(f) hereof or the covenant set forth in
Section 8.4(n) hereof or that may affect the determination of the amount of
accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for federal income tax
purposes) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing to which
Purchaser or Spirit Finance Corporation succeeded as a result of the
Acquisition, Purchaser shall provide Seller with prompt notice thereof and
shall permit, and cause its Affiliates, including the Company and the
Companys Subsidiaries, to permit, Seller to jointly control the
related portions of such audit, suit or similar proceeding.

  



  

(k) _Amended Tax Returns_. Seller shall have the right, at Sellers sole cost
and expense, to file amended Tax Returns for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date,
and such claims for Tax refunds as are attributable to Tax periods ending on
or prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to execute and file such amended Tax Returns and refund claims,
provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be required to cause such
execution to the extent such amended Tax Return or refund claim takes, and

  



        
   

  



  

no such amended Tax Return or refund claim shall be permitted to take, a
position with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is not
supported by applicable Tax law. Seller shall provide Purchaser with a draft
of any amended Tax Return or refund claim to be filed pursuant to this
Section 8.4(k) at least 15 days prior to the date on which such amended Tax
Return or refund claim is to be filed and shall consider in good faith any
comments received from Purchaser on such amended Tax Return or refund claim
within 10 days of the provision of such amended Tax Return or refund claim to
Purchaser.

  



  

(l) _Intended Tax Treatment_. Seller and Purchaser agree that they shall, and
Purchaser agrees that it shall cause its Affiliates, the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, treat the Master Leases for federal income tax purposes and,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, state tax purposes, as entered
into on the day following the Closing Date (thus, for the avoidance of doubt,
the parties agree to treat, and Purchaser agrees to cause its Affiliates and
the Company and its Subsidiaries to treat, the "next day rule" of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b) and any corresponding state tax rule as
applying with respect to the entering into of the Master Leases). Seller and
Purchaser agree that they shall, and Purchaser agrees that it shall cause its
Affiliates and the Company and its Subsidiaries to, treat, as a result of the
"next day rule" of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b) (or any
corresponding state tax rule) or otherwise, any liquidation of the Company or
its Subsidiaries that is deemed to occur for federal or state tax purposes as
a result of the Acquisition as occurring after the Company has ceased to be a
member of the consolidated, combined, unitary or similar Tax group of which
Seller is a member. Purchaser and Seller agree not to take positions on their
Tax Returns inconsistent with the treatment described in this Section 8.4(l)
and Purchaser agrees that it shall cause its Affiliates not to take positions
on their Tax Returns inconsistent with the treatment described in this
Section 8.4(l).

  



  

(m) _Further Assurances_. Following the Closing, each of the Purchaser and
the Seller shall execute such documents and other instruments and take such
further actions as may reasonably be required in furtherance of the
Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(n) _Bring-down of Tax Basis Information_. Within 5 Business Days following
the date of this Agreement, the Seller will provide Purchaser with the
accurate adjusted tax bases, as of April 29, 2006, for federal and state
income tax purposes of the Company and its Subsidiaries in their assets to be
held as of the Closing and an accurate list setting forth all elections of
the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to tax depreciation and tax
amortization that applied as of April 29, 2006 to the Company or its
Subsidiaries with respect to the assets to be held as of the Closing. Within
5 Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the Seller will provide
Purchaser with a written statement updating the information described in the
preceding sentence to accurately reflect what such information would have
been as of May 27, 2006 (as determined assuming that there will be no changes
in the assets to be held by the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the
Closing, that the Acquisition does not occur and that the Tax elections
identified pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 8.4(n) will

  



        
   

  



  

not change). Within 45 days following the Closing Date, the Seller will
provide Purchaser with a written statement updating the information described
in the first sentence of this Section 8.4(n) to make it accurate as of
immediately prior to the Closing (based upon allocating depreciation or
amortization for the fiscal month that includes the Closing Date on a pro
rata basis). The updated information provided for in this Section 8.4(n) will
include information regarding alternative minimum tax depreciable lives,
conventions and accumulated depreciation and will be in an excel spreadsheet
format.

  



  

(o) _Delivery of Final Earnings and Profits Report_. Seller will, by October
15, 2006, cause a "big four" accounting firm or another firm mutually agreed
upon by Purchaser and Seller to deliver to Purchaser a federal tax earnings
and profits report with respect to the Company that incorporates the items
described in clauses (a) and (b) of clause (i) of the second sentence of
Section 11.6(g) hereof with respect to the tax periods ending December 28,
2005, January 28, 2006 and the Closing Date and will provide Purchaser such
other documentation as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser to assist
Purchaser in reviewing the report. If such report is not in final form at the
time provided, Seller shall cause such report to be provided to Purchaser
when it is in final form, in no event later than December 15, 2006.

TERMINATION

  



  

10.1 _Termination_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement may be terminated and the Acquisition abandoned at any
time prior to the Closing:

  



  

(i) by mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Seller;

  



        
   

  



  

(ii) by the Purchaser or the Seller if the Closing does not occur on or
before May 31, 2006, unless the Audited Financial Statements have not been
delivered to Purchaser on or before such date, in which event this Agreement
may be terminated by the Purchaser or the Seller if the Closing does not
occur on or before the earlier of (x) five business days following the
delivery of the Audited Financial Statements or (y) June 30; 2006; _provided_
, _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 10.1(a)(ii) shall not be available to any party whose breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement has been
the cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or before
such date;

  



  

(iii) by the Purchaser or the Seller if any of the conditions set forth in
Section 9.1 have not been satisfied and have become incapable of fulfillment
and shall not have been waived by the parties;

  



  

(iv) by the Purchaser if any of the conditions set forth in Section 9.2 have
not been satisfied and have become incapable of fulfillment and shall not
have been waived by the Purchaser;

  



  

(v) by the Seller if any of the conditions set forth in Section 9.3 have not
been satisfied and have become incapable of fulfillment and shall not have
been waived by the Seller; or

  



  

(vi) by the Purchaser or the Seller if a Governmental Entity shall have
issued an Order or taken any other action, in any case having the effect of
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Acquisition,
which Order or other action is final and non-appealable.

  



  

(b) The party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.1(a)(ii), (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) shall give written notice of such

as provided in Section 10.1, this Agreement shall immediately become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Purchaser or the
Seller or their respective officers, directors, stockholders or Affiliates

INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

11.1 _Survival_. The representations and warranties of the parties hereto
contained in this Agreement and any certificate or other document provided
hereunder or thereunder will terminate at the Closing, except that the

timely given under this Article XI on or prior to such termination date until
the related claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise
resolved as provided in Article XI, but only with respect to matters
described in such Claim Notice. The covenants and agreements which by their
terms do not contemplate performance after the Closing shall terminate as of,
and not survive, the Closing. The covenants and agreements which by their
terms contemplate performance after the Closing and expire upon a date
certain shall survive until such date certain, the covenant set forth in
Section 8.4(n) hereof shall expire on the eighth anniversary of the Closing
Date (or until such later date as may be necessary to permit resolution of a
timely claim for indemnification under Section 11.6(f) hereof) and those
covenants and agreements set forth herein which do not expire upon a date
certain (other than the covenant set forth in Section 8.4(n)) shall survive
the Closing in accordance with their terms until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations.

  



  

11.2 _Indemnification by the Seller_. Subject to the limitations set forth
herein, following the Closing, the Seller shall indemnify and defend the
Company, its Subsidiaries, the Purchaser and their respective directors,
officers, stockholders, employees, affiliates, assigns and representatives ("
_Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") against, and shall hold the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties harmless from, (i) any loss, liability, claim, charge,
action, suit, proceeding, assessed interest, penalty, deficiency, damage,
expense (including interest and penalties imposed or assessed by any judicial
or administrative body, costs of investigation and defense and reasonably
attorneys fees) or

  



        
   

  



  

Tax (collectively, " _Losses_ ") resulting from, arising out of, or incurred
by the Purchaser Indemnified Party in connection with any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Seller contained in
this Agreement, (ii) any Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries paid
after the Closing Date that (a) are for a Straddle Period and for which
Seller is responsible under Section 8.4(g) hereof, (b) are for a Tax period
ending on or before the Closing Date or (c) are Transfer Taxes for which
Seller is responsible under Section 8.4(d) hereof, other than, in the case of
each of (a) through (c), any such Taxes resulting from (x) any breach by
Purchaser of its covenants or agreements under this Agreement, (y) any action
taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries simultaneous with (if
initiated by Purchaser or its Affiliates) or after the Closing on the Closing
Date that is outside the ordinary course of business other than such
an action which Seller has consented to in a writing that refers to this
Section 11.2 or (z) any adjustment arising under Section 481(a) of the Code
or any corresponding or similar adjustment under foreign, state or local tax
law as a result of the Acquisition, (iii) any Losses resulting from, arising
out of, or incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in connection with
any Environmental Liabilities, and (iv) any Losses incurred by any of
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties as a result of the failure of any Real
Property Asset transferred hereunder to be in compliance with applicable Law,
other than Environmental Laws (collectively, " _Non-Compliance Liabilities_
"). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in no event
shall the Purchaser be indemnified hereunder for any matter for which the
Company is actually and fully indemnified against in accordance with the
terms of the Restructuring Agreements; it being understood that the Purchaser
will first pursue its remedies against the Restructuring Agreements if they
provide a remedy for a Loss and, only in the event the Purchaser or the
Company, as the case may be, is not actually and, fully indemnified under
such Agreements, would the Purchaser Indemnified Party proceed against the
Seller for indemnification under this Section 11.2.

  



  

11.3 _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. Subject to the limitations set forth
herein, following the Closing the Purchaser shall indemnify and defend the
Seller against, and shall hold the Seller harmless from, (i) any Loss
resulting from, arising out of, or incurred by the Seller in connection with
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
Purchaser contained in this Agreement, (ii) any Taxes imposed on the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries, Seller or any consolidated, combined, unitary or
similar Tax group of which Seller or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
was a member on or prior to the Closing Date resulting from (x) any breach by
Purchaser of its covenants or agreements under this Agreement, (y) any action
taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries simultaneous with (if
initiated by Purchaser or its Affiliates) or after the Closing on the Closing
Date that is outside the ordinary course of business other than such an
action which Seller has consented to in a writing that refers to Section 11.2
hereof or (z) any adjustment arising under Section 481(a) of the Code or any
corresponding or similar adjustment under foreign, state or local tax law as
a result of the Acquisition and (iii) any Transfer Taxes for which Purchaser
is responsible under Section 8.4(d) hereof.

  



        
   

  



  

11.4 _Indemnification Procedure for Third Party Claims_.

  



  

(a) In the event that any claim or demand for which an Indemnitor may be
liable to an Indemnitee hereunder is asserted by a third party (a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), the Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Indemnitor in
writing of such Third Party Claim (such notice, a " _Claim Notice_ "), but
the failure to so notify the Indemnitor will not relieve the Indemnitor of
any liability that it may have to the Indemnitee, except to the extent that
the Indemnitor demonstrates that the defense of such action is prejudiced by
the Indemnitees failure to give such notice. The Claim Notice shall (i)
state that the Indemnitee has paid or properly accrued Losses or anticipates
that it will incur liability for Losses for which such Indemnitee is entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) specify in
reasonable detail each individual item of Loss included in the amount so
stated, the date such item was paid or properly accrued, the basis for any
anticipated liability and the nature of the breach of representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement to which each such item is related and the
computation of the amount to which such Indemnitee claims to be entitled
hereunder. The Indemnitee shall enclose with the Claim Notice a copy of all
papers served with respect to such Third Party Claim, if any, and any other
documents evidencing such Third Party Claim. For purposes of this Section
11.4, any Tax Controversy will be treated as a Third Party Claim.

  



  

(b) Subject to the provisions set forth in Section 8.4(j), the Indemnitor
shall have 30 days from the date on which the Indemnitor received the Claim
Notice to notify the Indemnitee that the Indemnitor desires to assume the
defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim and any litigation resulting
therefrom with counsel of its choice (which counsel shall be reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser) and at its sole cost and expense. If the Indemnitor
assumes the defense of such claim in accordance herewith: (i) the Indemnitee
may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate
in the defense of such Third Party Claim, but the Indemnitor shall control
the investigation, defense and settlement thereof; (ii) the Indemnitee shall
not file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnitor; and (iii) the Indemnitor shall not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third
Party Claim to the extent such judgment or settlement provides for equitable
relief without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee. The parties shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize Losses from Third Party
Claims, act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or
otherwise dealing with such claims, and cooperate in any such defense and
give each other reasonable access to all information relevant thereto.
Whether or not the Indemnitor has assumed the defense of such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnitor will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee
hereunder with respect to any settlement entered into or any judgment
consented to without the Indemnitors prior written consent.

  



  

(c) Subject to the provisions of Section 8.4(j), if the Indemnitor does not
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within 30 days of receipt of the
Claim Notice, the Indemnitee will be entitled to assume such defense, at its
sole cost and expense (or, if the Indemnitee incurs a Loss with respect to
the matter in question for which the Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 11.2 or 11.3, as

  



        
   

  



  

applicable, at the expense of the Indemnitor), upon delivery of notice
to such effect to the Indemnitor; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Indemnitor (i) shall have the right to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim at its sole cost and expense, but the Indemnitee
shall control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof; (ii) may
at any time thereafter assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, in
which event the Indemnitor shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses
of the Indemnitees counsel incurred prior to the assumption by the
Indemnitor of the defense of such Third Party Claim; and (iii) shall not be
obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder for any settlement entered
into or any judgment consented to without the Indemnitors prior written
consent.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding any provisions in this Agreement to the contrary, if
there is a conflict between the provisions of this Section 11.4 and the
provisions of Section 8.4(j), the provisions set forth in Section 8.4(j)
shall control.

  



  

11.5 _Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. The Indemnitee
will notify the Indemnitor in writing promptly of its discovery of any matter
for which the Indemnitor may be liable to the Indemnitee hereunder that does
not involve a Third Party Claim, which Claim Notice shall (a) state that the
Indemnitee has paid or properly accrued Losses or anticipates that it will
incur liability for Losses for which such Indemnitee is entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, and (b) specify in
reasonable detail each individual item of Loss included in the amount so
stated, the date such item was paid or properly accrued, the basis for any
anticipated liability and the nature of the breach of representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement to which each such item is related and the
computation of the amount to which the Indemnitee claims to be entitled
hereunder. In the event that the Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnitee
that it disputes such claim within 30 days from receipt of such Claim Notice,
the claim specified therein shall be deemed a liability of the Indemnitor
hereunder (subject to the limitations set forth in this Article XI,
as applicable). The Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate and assist the
Indemnitor in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the
Indemnitee and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and
cooperation shall include providing reasonable access to and copies of
information, records and documents relating to such matters, furnishing
employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of such
matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such
matters.

  



  

11.6 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) No party hereto shall be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless
any Person pursuant to this Article XI unless a Claim Notice is delivered
pursuant to this Article XI; _provided_ , _that_ no claims
for indemnification, other than claims under Section 11.6(f) and (g)
hereof, shall be made hereunder prior to (i) the first anniversary of the
Closing or (ii) the accrual of Claims equal to or exceeding $125,000,
whichever occurs earlier, and, thereafter, Claims shall be made no more
frequently than (x) quarterly, or (y) the accrual of Claims equal to or
exceeding $125,000, whichever occurs earlier.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) Other than with respect to any breach of Section 4.6 or any claims for
Taxes, Environmental Liabilities or Non-Compliance Liabilities, in no event
shall the cumulative indemnification obligations of the Seller, on the one
hand, or the Purchaser, on the other hand, under this Article XI in the
aggregate exceed fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) (the " _Cap_ ").

  



  

(c) The amount of Losses payable under this Article XI by the Indemnitor
shall be reduced (i) by any amounts recovered, net of actual costs and
expenses of recovery, by the Indemnitee under insurance policies or from any
other Person, and (ii) by any Tax benefit of the Indemnitee or any Affiliate
of the Indemnitee arising from the incurrence or payment of any such
indemnified amount; _provided_ , that the full amount of the Losses shall be
paid by the Indemnitor at the time of the claim for payment by the
Indemnitee, and the Indemnitee shall reimburse the Indemnitor for any amounts
actually recovered or realized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) at the time of
such recovery or realization.

  



  

(d) No party hereto shall be obligated to indemnify any other Person with
respect to (i) any breach of a representation or warranty if such breach was
corrected by disclosure in the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or in any Seller Disclosure Schedule Supplement, (ii) any
covenant or condition waived by the party seeking indemnification on or prior
to the Closing, or (iii) any indirect, special, incidental, consequential
or punitive damages. Each party hereto agrees that, for so long as such party
has any right of indemnification under Article XI, it shall not, and shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that its Affiliates do
not, voluntarily or by discretionary action, accelerate the timing, or
increase the cost of any obligation of any other party under this Article XI,
except to the extent that such action is taken (x) for a reasonable
legitimate purpose and not with a purpose of discovering a condition that
would constitute a breach of any representation or warranty, covenant or
agreement of the other party hereto or (y) in response to a discovery by such
party, without violation of the immediately preceding clause (y), of
meaningful evidence of a condition that constitutes a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of any other party hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, an Indemnitor shall not be
obligated to indemnify an Indemnitee for any Loss to the extent arising from
any such voluntary or discretionary action, other than as so excepted.

  



  

(e) The Purchaser shall have no claim or right to indemnification pursuant to
this Article XI or otherwise, and none of the Seller, the Company, any
Subsidiary of the Company or any other Person shall have or be subject to any
liability to the other party hereto or any other Person, in respect of
any misstatement, omission or misrepresentation contained in any
information, documents or materials furnished or made available to the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or
advisors by the Seller, the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or
advisors in certain "data rooms," management presentations or any other form
in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby; it being expressly
understood that such information,

  



        
   

  



  

documents or materials in no way affect the representations and warranties
made by the Seller herein or Purchasers rights to indemnification hereunder.

  



  

(f) Except as provided in Section 11.6(g) in connection with earnings
and profits, Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify any Person under
this Agreement for any Loss arising directly or indirectly as a result of the
Tax attributes, including without limitation, adjusted tax basis and or
carryovers, of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to, as of
or following the Closing, except that, in the event that as a result of a
breach of the representations or warranties set forth in Section 4.6(f) or a
breach of the covenant set forth in Section 8.4(n) hereof, Purchaser or
Spirit Finance Corporation unknowingly fails to satisfy, with respect to a
taxable year for which such entity qualified as a "real estate investment
trust" for federal income tax purposes, the distribution requirement imposed
on it under Section 857(a)(1) of the Code, then Seller shall be obligated to
indemnify Purchaser under this Agreement in respect of such breach in an
amount equal to (and in no event in excess of) the sum of (a) the product of
(I) the amount by which Purchaser or Spirit Finance Corporation failed to
satisfy the distribution requirement under Section 857(a)(1) of the Code as a
result of such breach and (II) .05 and (b) the amount of the interest charge
actually imposed on the Purchaser or Spirit Finance Corporation under Section
860 of the Code in respect of the deficiency dividends (as such term is
defined in Section 860 of the Code) paid to remedy the failure to satisfy the
distribution requirement in Section 857(a)(1) described in this sentence that
resulted from the failure to distribute the amount described in clause (I),
but only, in the case of this clause (b), to the extent that (i) such
interest expense is attributable to the portion of the deficiency dividend
attributable to a "determination" (as defined for purposes of Section 860 of
the Code) that has established that a representation and warranty in Section
4.6(f) hereof was inaccurate or that there was a breach of the covenant set
forth in Section 8.4(n) hereof and (ii) such interest charge does not relate
to any period of time that is more than 30 days (60 days if the portion of
the deficiency dividend described in clause (b) above exceeds $20 million)
after the date of the "determination", as such term is defined for purposes
of Section 860 of the Code, to which such deficiency dividend relates. There
will be no right to indemnity under this Section 11.6(f) unless the
Purchasers claim for such indemnity, describing in reasonable detail the
basis for such claim, is received by Seller prior to the eighth anniversary
of the Closing Date. Nothing in this Section 11.6(f) shall alter the Sellers
responsibility for Taxes imposed on the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to Pre-Closing Periods, as provided for elsewhere in this Agreement.

  



  

(g) Seller agrees to indemnify Purchaser hereunder for the earnings and
profits (as determined for federal income tax purposes) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of Closing to which Purchaser or Spirit Finance
Corporation succeeds (provided that such successor qualifies as a "real
estate investment trust" for

  



        
   

  



  

federal income tax purposes) as a result of the Acquisition, with the amount
of such indemnity to equal (and in no event to exceed) in the aggregate the
lesser of (I) the product of (i) the earnings and profits (as determined for
federal income tax purposes) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
Closing to which Purchaser or Spirit Finance Corporation succeeds (provided
that such successor qualifies as a "real estate investment trust" for federal
income tax purposes) as a result of the Acquisition and (ii) .05 and (II)
$5,100,000. In addition, Seller agrees to indemnify Purchaser for the amount
of any interest charge actually imposed upon Purchaser or its Affiliates
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.857-11 in connection with earnings and
profits (as determined for federal income tax purposes) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the Closing to which Purchaser or Spirit Finance
Corporation succeeds (provided that such successor qualifies as a "real
estate investment trust" for federal income tax purposes) as a result of the
Acquisition; but only to the extent that (x) the interest charge is imposed
in respect of earnings and profits of the Company or its Subsidiaries as of
the Closing attributable to (i) any inconsistency between the actual results
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the Tax periods ending December 28,
2005, January 28, 2006 and the Closing Date and those results as set forth in
(a) an income tax provision calculation or draft or final federal income Tax
Return for the Company for the federal Tax year ended December 28, 2005
provided by Seller to Purchaser by October 15, 2006 or (b) financial
statements (including balance sheets and income statements) for the periods
ending December 28, 2005, January 28, 2006 and the Closing Date provided by
Seller to the Purchaser by October 15, 2006 or (ii) Seller filing, or causing
the Company or its Subsidiaries to file, Tax Returns after the date hereof
that are inconsistent with the items described in clauses (a) or (b) of
clause (i) above and (y) such interest charge does not relate to any period
of time that is more than 30 days (60 days if the amount of earnings and
profits described in clause (x) above exceeds $20 million) after the date on
which Purchaser or its Affiliates have determined or received notice that
Purchaser or Spirit Finance Corporation succeeded to the amount of earnings
and profits to which such interest charge relates. For the avoidance of
doubt, it is agreed that for the purposes of clause (ii) of the preceding
sentence, no filing or document entered into or created in connection with an
audit, suit or similar Tax proceeding shall constitute a Tax Return. Except
to the extent provided in this Section 11.6(g), in no event shall there be
any indemnification by Seller under this Agreement in respect of Losses
arising, directly or indirectly, as a result of the amount of the earnings
and profits (as determined for federal income tax purposes) of the Company or
its Subsidiaries as of any time. There will be no right to indemnity under
this Section 11.6(g) unless the Purchasers claim for such indemnity,
describing in reasonable detail the basis for such claim, is received by
Seller prior to the eighth anniversary of the Closing Date.

  



  

(h) In the event that Purchaser makes a claim for indemnity under Section
11.6(f) or Section 11.6(g) hereof, Seller and Purchaser shall work together
in good faith to determine the amount owed by Purchaser hereunder and, if
unable to reach agreement within 30 days of Sellers receipt of such claim,
shall jointly select a nationally recognized accounting firm to determine the
amount owed in respect of such claim, which firm shall resolve such dispute
as soon as reasonably practical. If the parties are unable to jointly select
a nationally recognized accounting firm to address such dispute in the first
instance, each shall select a nationally recognized accounting firm and those
two firms shall jointly select a third nationally recognized accounting firm
(in absence of agreement as to the selection of said third nationally
recognized accounting firm, such selection shall be made by a mediation
process reasonably agreed upon by the parties or in the absence of same, by a
court of competent jurisdiction). The

  



        
   

  



  

costs and expenses of the nationally recognized accounting firm resolving the
dispute shall be borne by Seller and Purchaser in such proportion as such
firm determines reflects the relative merits of the position of each such
party with respect to the items in dispute. In the case of an indemnity claim
under Section 11.6(g) hereof, the provisions of this Section 11.6(h) shall
not be available unless the potential amount of the claim, together with all
other claims that have previously been subject to this sentence exceeds
$100,000. Within 5 Business Days following the resolution of the amount of an
indemnity payment under this Section 11.6(h), the amount of indemnification
determined under this Section 11.6(h) will be paid.

  



  

(i) Any claim by the Purchaser pursuant to this Article XI with respect
to Environmental Liabilities must be brought within five (5) years after
the expiration of the Term (as defined in the Master Leases) of the Master
Lease governing the Real Property Asset for which the claim is being made.

  



  

(j) Seller shall have no liability hereunder in any way with respect to the
content or conclusions of any report provided pursuant to Section 8.4(o)
hereof. Nothing in this Section 11.6(j) shall limit the application of
Section 11.6(g) hereof.

  



  

11.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees
that, should the Closing occur, its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any and all matters arising out of, relating to or connected with this
Agreement, the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) shall
be a claim pursuant to the provisions of this Article XI (or a claim under
the Restructuring Agreements, in the event a right to a claim exists
thereunder). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto (on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates (including, in the case of the Purchaser following
the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries)) hereby waives, from and after
the Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of action which such party
may have against the other party hereto or any of its Affiliates arising
under or based upon any Law or otherwise, other than pursuant to this Article
XI or the provisions of the Restructuring Agreements.

  



  

11.8 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. Except as otherwise
required by applicable Law, the parties hereto shall treat any
indemnification payment made hereunder as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price.

  



  

11.9 _Effect of Investigation_. No fact, event, misrepresentation
or occurrence that, in the absence of this Section 11.9, would constitute
a breach of any representation or warranty of the Seller or the Purchaser
under this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a breach by such party of
its representations or warranties under this Agreement for which the
Indemnitee would be entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Article XI if
the Indemnitee has knowledge of such breach as of the Closing Date;
_provided_   _that_ the Purchaser shall be entitled to deliver to the Seller
a certificate signed on behalf of the Purchaser by an officer of the
Purchaser to the effect that no such knowledge of any breach(es) exists as of
the Closing Date.

 ** _MASTER LEASE_**

  

 ** **

  

 **THIS MASTER LEASE** (hereinafter this " _Lease_ ") is made and entered
into as of the  day of , 2006 (the " _Effective Date_
"), by and between [List the names of the respective SPEs] each, a Delaware
limited liability company (hereinafter, collectively, " _Landlord_ "), and
, a Delaware limited liability company (hereinafter " _Tenant_ ").

  



  

 **ARTICLE 1. 
 GRANT AND TERM**

  

 ** **

  

1.01 **_Grant of Lease_**. Landlord, for and in consideration of the rents
reserved herein and of the covenants and agreements contained herein on the
part of Tenant to be performed, hereby leases to Tenant, and Tenant hereby
leases from Landlord, those certain parcels of land owned by Landlord in fee
and listed on _Exhibit A-1_ attached hereto and made a part hereof (the "
_Fee Properties_ ") and those certain parcels of land held by Landlord as the
tenant under a lease, if any, in effect as of the date hereof (each such
lease, an " _Overlease_ " and collectively, the " _Overleases_ "), and listed
on _Exhibit A-2_ attached hereto and made a part hereof (the " _Leasehold
Properties_ "; the Fee Properties and Leasehold Properties are each, a "
_Parcel_ " and collectively, the " _Parcels_ " and legally described on
_Exhibit A-3_ attached hereto and made a part hereof and the Overleases are
listed on _Exhibit A-4_ attached hereto and made a part hereof) and all of
the buildings located on each of the Parcels (each, a " _Building_ " and
collectively the " _Buildings_ ") and with respect to each Parcel, all other
improvements erected or situated on each such Parcel, including, but not
limited to, to the extent they exist, parking areas; access roads; entrances
and driveways; lighting facilities; grass, shrubs, trees and landscaping;
retaining walls; passageways, sidewalks and curbs; culverts; retention basins
and drainage facilities; directional and shopping center pylons or monuments;
sewer and sewage disposal systems; water supply, electric lines; gas lines
and other service and utility lines, pipes and installations of every kind
(each Parcel, together with the Building and the other improvements located
thereon, a " _Property Location_ " and collectively, the " _Premises_ "),
together with all easements (including any rights under applicable
construction, operating and/or reciprocal easements agreements) over
adjoining real property, rights of way, hereditaments, interests in or to
adjacent streets or alleys or other real property and all the benefits
thereunto belonging and appertaining to any portion of the Premises.

  



  

1.02 **_Term of Lease_**. The term hereof shall commence on
 (the " _Commencement Date_ "), and shall expire on
 (the " _Expiration Date_ "), unless earlier terminated or extended
as provided in this Lease (the " _Term_ "). [20 years for ShopKo properties;
15 years for Pamida properties]

  



  

1.03 **_Extension Options_**. Landlord agrees that Tenant shall have, and it
is hereby granted, two (2) successive options (the " _Extension Options_ ")
to extend the Term as to any Property Location or Property Locations, in
Tenants sole discretion, for a period of ten (10) years each (individually,
an " _Extension Period_ ", and collectively, the " _Extension Periods_ "),
each such Extension Period to begin respectively upon the expiration of the
initial Term or the prior Extension Period, as the case may be. All of the
terms, covenants and provisions of this Lease

        
   

  



  

shall apply to each Extension Period with respect to the Property Locations
that Tenant elects to extend, except that Base Rent for each of the
Extension Periods shall continue to be adjusted pursuant to the terms of
_Sections 1.04 and 2.01_ below, payable in equal monthly installments as
Monthly Base Rent (as hereinafter defined in _Section 2.01_). In order to
exercise the Extension Options, Tenant shall give Landlord notice of such
exercise (which notice shall identify the Property Locations that are to be
extended) no later than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the end of the
initial Term of this Lease or the prior Extension Period, as the case may be;
provided, however, that if Tenant shall fail to give the notice within the
aforesaid time limit, Tenants right to exercise its option shall
nevertheless continue during said one hundred twenty (120) day period until
thirty (30) days after Landlord shall have given Tenant notice of Landlords
election to terminate such option (" _Landlord s Notice_"), and Tenant may
exercise such option at any time until the expiration of said thirty (30) day
period. It is the intention of the parties to avoid forfeiture of Tenants
rights to extend the Term under any of the options set forth in this Lease
through inadvertent failure to give the extension notice within the time
limits prescribed. Accordingly, if Tenant shall fail to give an extension
notice to Landlord for any of the Extension Periods, and if Landlord shall
fail to give Landlords Notice to Tenant, then until the expiration of thirty
(30) days following Landlords Notice, or until Tenant either exercises its
option to extend or notifies Landlord that it does not intend to exercise
said option to extend, the Term shall be extended automatically from month to
month upon all the terms and conditions then in effect, except that Monthly
Base Rent shall be increased in accordance with _Article 8_, and in no event
shall the Term extend beyond the last date of the last Extension Period. Upon
the failure of Tenant to exercise one or any of the options herein following
Landlords Notice, and, in any event, upon expiration of the last of such
Extension Periods, Tenant shall have no further or additional right to renew
or extend this Lease.

  



  

1.04 **_Base Rent Reset_**. Notwithstanding the terms and provisions of
_Section 1.03_, upon the commencement of each Extension Period of this
Lease, the Base Rent shall be reset as determined in accordance with _Section
31.24_ hereof (the " _FMV Reset_ "). The parties shall commence the process
for determining fair market rent upon Tenants delivery to Landlord of
written notice requesting such determination; provided, however, such notice
shall be delivered at least three (3) months, but in no event earlier than
eight (8) months, before the date for exercising the Extension Option for
such Extension Period. The foregoing shall in no way affect the Base Rent
adjustments under _Section 2.01_; provided, however, in the event the
commencement of an Extension Period shall occur on an Adjustment Date, the
FMV Reset shall be the only adjustment to Base Rent.

  



  

1.05 **_Lease Year Defined_**. As used in this Lease, the term " _Lease Year_
" shall mean (a) if the Commencement Date is the first (1st) day of a
calendar month, the twelve (12) month period commencing on the Commencement
Date or (b) if the Commencement Date is not the first (1st) day of a calendar
month, the period commencing on the Commencement Date and ending on the last
day of the twelfth (12th) full calendar month of the Term, and in either
case, each succeeding twelve (12) month period thereafter which falls in
whole or in part during the Term.

  



        
   

  



  

 **ARTICLE 2. 
 RENT**

  

 ** **

  

2.01 **_Base Rent_**. Throughout the Term, Tenant shall pay to Landlord an
annual base rent for the Premises (the " _Base Rent_ "), without notice or
demand. The Base Rent for the first Lease Year shall be equal to **[ShopKo -
$66,433,139.98; Pamida - $7,958,616.75]**. Subject to _Section 1.04_, on
 1, 2009 and every third anniversary thereafter during the Term (the "
_Adjustment Date_ "), the Base Rent shall increase by the lesser of (a)
1.25 multiplied by the product of (i) the Base Rent in effect immediately
prior to the applicable Adjustment Date and (ii) the CPI Increase
(as hereinafter defined in _Section 31.16_) or (b) 6% of the Base Rent in
effect immediately prior to the applicable Adjustment Date. Base Rent shall
be payable in equal monthly installments (hereinafter referred to as "
_Monthly Base Rent_ "), in advance, on the first (1st) day of the Term and on
the first (1st) day of each calendar month thereafter of the Term. If the
Term begins on any day except the first (1st) day of a calendar month or ends
on any day except the last day of a calendar month, the Monthly Base Rent
shall be prorated by multiplying the Monthly Base Rent by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days remaining in the month (including
the Effective Date) and the denominator of which is the total number of days
in such month.

  



  

2.02 **_Manner of Payment_**. Upon the Effective Date, Landlord shall deliver
to Tenant a confirmation of Landlords account information allowing Tenant to
establish arrangements whereby payments of the Base Rent and all other
amounts becoming due from Tenant to Landlord hereunder, are transferred by
Automated Clearing House Debit initiated by Tenant from an account
established by Tenant at a United States bank or other financial institution
to such account as Landlord may designate. Tenant shall continue to pay all
Base Rent by Automated Clearing House Debit unless otherwise designated from
time to time by written notice from Landlord to Tenant.

  



  

2.03 **_Net Lease_**. It is the intention of the parties hereto that the
obligations of Tenant hereunder shall be separate and independent covenants
and agreements, that any Base Rent, Impositions and all other sums payable by
Tenant hereunder (hereinafter collectively referred to as " _Rent_ ") shall
continue to be payable in all events, and that the obligations of Tenant
hereunder shall continue unaffected, unless the requirement to pay or perform
the same shall have been terminated pursuant to an express provision of this
Lease or by operation of law. This is a net lease and Base Rent, Impositions,
and all other items of Rent and all other sums payable hereunder by Tenant
shall be paid without notice or demand, and without setoff, counterclaim,
abatement, deferment, or deduction, except as otherwise specifically set
forth herein or provided by law, and Tenant shall enforce any rights against
Landlord in an independent action; provided, however, in no event shall
Tenant be liable for any interest, principal, late fees or other expenses
relating to any debt incurred by Landlord or other costs incurred by Landlord
in financing or refinancing the Premises. Except as provided under
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other proceeding affecting
Landlord, Tenant agrees that, except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, it shall not take any action to terminate, rescind or avoid this
Lease notwithstanding (a) the exercise of any remedy, including
foreclosure, under any Mortgage, (b) any action with respect to this Lease
(including the disaffirmance hereof) which may be taken by Landlord under the
Federal Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, (c) the taking of the Premises or
any portion thereof (except as expressly provided

  



        
   

  



  

herein), (d) the prohibition or restriction of Tenants use of the Premises
under any Laws, or (e) the destruction of the Premises or any portion
thereof (except as expressly provided herein).

  



  

 **ARTICLE 3. 
 IMPOSITIONS**

  

 ** **

  

3.01 **_Tenant to Pay Impositions_**. Tenant shall pay or cause to be paid,
directly to the applicable taxing authority (except as otherwise expressly
set forth in _Section 30.01_ hereof) in a timely manner and as hereinafter
provided, all of the following items, if any, to the extent that such items
arise out of the use, ownership or operation of each Property Location that
accrue during the Term (each, an " _Imposition_ " and collectively, the "
_Impositions_ "): (a) real property taxes and assessments; (b) taxes on
personal property, trade fixtures and improvements located on or relating to
the Premises, whether belonging to Landlord or Tenant; (c) occupancy and rent
taxes; (d) levies; (e) gross receipts, excise or similar taxes (i.e., taxes
customarily based upon gross income or receipts which fail to take into
account deductions relating to any Property Location) imposed or levied upon,
assessed against or measured by Base Rent or other Rent payable hereunder,
but only to the extent that such taxes would be payable if such Property
Location (together with any other Property Locations owned by Landlord and
subject to this Lease) were the only properties of Landlord; (f) all excise,
franchise, privilege, license, sales, value added, use and similar taxes
imposed upon the Rent or other monies owed hereunder, or upon the leasehold
estate of either party (other than, transfers, sales or similar taxes imposed
in connection with a direct or indirect transfer of Landlords leasehold
estate); (g) payments in lieu of each of the foregoing, whether or not
expressly so designated; (h) fines, penalties and other similar or like
governmental charges applicable to any of the foregoing and any interest or
costs with respect thereto solely attributable to the acts of Tenant; and (i)
any and all other federal, state, county and municipal governmental and
quasi-governmental levies, assessments or taxes and charges, general and
special, ordinary and extraordinary, foreseen and unforeseen, of every kind
and nature whatsoever, and any interest or costs with respect thereto, which
are due and payable or accrue at any time during the Term. Each such
Imposition, or installment thereof, during the Term shall be paid before the
last day the same may be paid without fine, penalty, interest or additional
cost; provided, however, that if, by law, any Imposition may at the option of
the taxpayer be paid in installments (whether or not interest shall accrue on
the unpaid balance of such Imposition) (" _Installments_ "), Tenant may
exercise the option to pay the same in such Installments and shall be
responsible for the payment of such Installments only, provided that all such
Installment payments relating to periods prior to the expiration of the Term
are required to be made prior to the Expiration Date or early termination of
this Lease. Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 3.01_ to the
contrary, (i) "Impositions" shall include all real property taxes and
assessments which were assessed, levied or imposed or which accrued prior to
the Term if payable during the Term, and Tenant shall promptly pay such items
as and when they become due and payable, and (ii) any real property taxes and
assessments which accrue during the Term but become payable after the Term
shall continue to be Tenants obligation or responsibility to pay.

  



  

3.02 **_Receipt of Payment_**. Tenant shall furnish to Landlord, within
thirty (30) days after each Imposition is due, evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Landlord evidencing the payment of an Imposition. Landlord
and Tenant shall notify the appropriate governmental authorities to deliver
bills or invoices for Impositions directly to Tenant. Notwithstanding

  



        
   

  



  

anything in this Lease to the contrary, if Landlord and Tenant are unable,
after having made commercially reasonable efforts to do so, to cause direct
billing of Impositions to Tenants address, and Landlord fails to promptly
(but in any event within ten (10) business days after receipt thereof),
deliver to Tenant any bill or invoice with respect to any Impositions that
Landlord may receive and Tenants payment of such Impositions within twenty
(20) business days after receipt of the tax bill results in the imposition of
interest, penalties and/or late fees, then Landlord shall be responsible for
such interest, penalties and/or late fees.

  



  

3.03 **_Exclusions_**.

  



  

(a) Except as provided in _Section 3.03(b)_ hereinbelow, nothing
contained in this _Article 3_ shall require Tenant to pay foreign, state,
local or federal income, inheritance, estate, succession, capital levy,
capital stock, stamp, transfer (except transfers occurring as a result of
Tenant exercising its right of substitution under _Section 12.05_
hereof), excess profit, revenue, gift or similar taxes of Landlord. For these
purposes, income taxes shall include (i) taxes, however labeled, determined
by reference to income, and (ii) any tax, however labeled, imposed on one
or more alternative bases, where one or more of such alternative bases is
based on income and the tax is in fact imposed on the income base; provided,
however, that the maximum additional amount of Impositions with respect to a
calendar year that Tenant may be responsible for hereunder as a result of
the inclusion of "and the tax is in fact imposed on the net income base" may
not exceed $50,000. Where a tax may be imposed on one or more
alternative bases, one or more of which is based on income, and it is not in
fact imposed on the income base, the tax actually imposed will be treated as
an income tax hereunder to the extent of the amount that would have been
imposed had the tax been imposed on an income base.

  



  

(b) If, at any time during the Term, a tax or excise on Base Rent or other
Rent or the right to receive rents or other tax, however described, is levied
or assessed against Landlord as a substitute in whole or in part for any
Impositions theretofore payable by Tenant, Tenant shall pay and discharge
such tax or excise on Base Rent or other Rent or other tax before interest or
penalties accrue, and the same shall be deemed to be an Imposition levied
against the Premises.

  



  

3.04 **_Contest_**. Tenant shall have the right to contest (in the case of
any item involving more than $10,000, after written notice to Landlord) the
amount or validity, in whole or in part, of any Imposition by appropriate
legal proceedings diligently conducted in good faith, at Tenants sole cost
and expense, provided that (a) no Default by Tenant has occurred and is
continuing; (b) such proceeding shall be permitted under and be conducted in
accordance with the provisions of any other instrument to which Tenant is
bound as a direct party and any REAs and Overleases and shall not constitute
a default thereunder and such proceeding shall be conducted in accordance
with all applicable Laws; (c) no Property Location nor any part thereof or
interest therein will be in danger of being sold, forfeited,
terminated, cancelled or lost as a result of such proceedings; (d) Tenant
shall promptly upon final determination thereof pay the amount of any
such Imposition, together with all costs, interest and penalties which may
be payable in connection therewith; (e) such proceeding shall suspend
the collection of such contested Imposition from the applicable Property
Location; and (f) Tenant shall furnish such security as may be required by
the appropriate governmental authorities in connection with the proceeding.
Upon the termination of such proceedings, it shall be the obligation of
Tenant to pay

  



        
   

  



  

the amount of such Imposition or part thereof as finally determined in
such proceedings, the payment of which may have been deferred during
the prosecution of such proceedings, together with any costs, fees
(including attorneys fees and disbursements), interest, penalties or other
liabilities in connection therewith.

  



  

3.05 **_Reduction of Assessed Valuation_**. Subject to the provisions of
_Section 3.04_, Tenant shall have the right to seek a reduction in the
assessed valuation of each Property Location for real property tax purposes
and to prosecute any action or proceeding in connection therewith.

  



  

3.06 **_Joinder of Landlord_**. Landlord shall join and reasonably cooperate
in any proceedings referred to in _Section 3.04_ or permit the same to be
brought in its name but shall not be liable for the payment of any costs or
expenses in connection with any such proceedings, and Tenant shall reimburse
(as incurred) and indemnify Landlord (promptly upon demand) for any and all
costs or expenses which Landlord may sustain or incur in connection with any
such proceedings.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 4. 
 USE; COMPLIANCE**

  

 ** **

  

4.01 **_Use_**. Tenant shall have the right to use and occupy the Premises
for any retail purpose or for any other use or purpose permitted by the
applicable zoning authority and otherwise by law and, as applicable, any REAs
(as defined in _Section 9.04_) or Overleases. Tenant shall have the right to
cease operations for business ("go dark") in up to ten percent (10%) of the
aggregate of the (a) rentable square footage of the Premises covered by this
Lease at the time of determination, and (b) rentable square footage of the
leased premises under the Other Lease at the time of determination.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) as to any particular Property Location, if
less than fifty percent (50%) of the rentable square footage of such Property
Location is not operating for business, no portion of such Property Location
shall be considered "dark", (ii) no portion of a Property Location shall
be considered "dark" unless such Property Location is "dark" for more than
twelve (12) consecutive months, (iii) no portion of a Property Location shall
be considered dark if Tenant ceases business operations in such Property
Location in connection with a casualty, condemnation or Capital Improvement
(as hereinafter defined in _Article 11_) or Force Majeure (as
hereinafter defined in _Section 31.10_), and (iv) Tenant shall have
the right to go dark in [ShopKo  1 distribution center; Pamida  the

the ten percent (10%) limitation set forth above. Tenant shall provide
Landlord with written notice of a "go dark" Property Location, and an
officers certificate of Tenant (1) certifying compliance with all of the
square footage requirements set forth in the foregoing subsections (a), (b)
and (i), and the other requirements or conditions set forth in the foregoing
subsections (ii), (iii) and (iv), and (2) attaching a schedule of square
footage calculations in support thereof (provided, however, that Tenants
failure to deliver such officers certificate to Landlord shall not
constitute a default hereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms and
provisions of this Lease and Tenants obligations hereunder (including
without limitation, the payment of Base Rent and other Rent without reduction
except as set forth in Articles 14 and 15, and Tenants maintenance
obligations under _Section 9.02_) shall remain in full force and effect with

4.02 **_Compliance_**. Tenants use and occupation of each of the Property
Locations, and the condition thereof, shall, at Tenants sole cost and
expense, comply fully with all Legal Requirements (defined below), and all
restrictions, covenants and encumbrances of record (including any owner
obligations under such Legal Requirements), with respect to the Premises, in
either event, the failure with which to comply could have a Material Adverse
Effect. Without in any way limiting the foregoing provisions, Tenant shall
comply with all Legal Requirements relating to money laundering, anti-
terrorism, trade embargos, economic sanctions, and the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990, as such act may be amended from time to time, and

hereafter in effect. Tenant shall comply with all Legal Requirements and
directives of governmental authorities and, upon receipt thereof, shall
provide to Landlord copies of all notices, reports and other communications
exchanged with, or received from, governmental authorities relating to any
actual or alleged noncompliance event, the failure of which to comply could
have a Material Adverse Effect. Tenant shall also reimburse Landlord for all
Costs incurred by Landlord in evaluating the effect of such an event on the
Premises and this Lease (to the extent Tenant is not using reasonable efforts
to comply with such event and Landlord makes a reasonable and good faith
determination that such evaluation is necessary), in obtaining any necessary
licenses from governmental authorities as may be necessary for Landlord to
enforce its rights hereunder, and in complying with all Legal Requirements
applicable to Landlord as the result of the existence of such an event, and
for any penalties or fines imposed upon Landlord as a result thereof. Tenant
will use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any act or condition to
exist on or about the Premises which will materially increase any insurance
rate thereon except when such acts are required in the normal course of its
business, and in any event, Tenant shall pay for such increase; provided,
however, the foregoing provision shall not in any way prevent Tenant from
having the right to use and occupy the Premises in accordance with _Section
4.01_ above. Except to the extent of Landlords willful wrongful acts or
gross negligence (provided that the term "gross negligence" used in this
Section shall not include gross negligence imputed as a matter of law to any
of the Landlord Indemnified Parties (as hereinafter defined in _Section
13.03(a)_) solely by reason of Landlords interest in any Property Location
or Tenants failure to act in respect of matters which are or were the
obligation of Tenant under this Lease), Tenant agrees that it will defend,
indemnify and hold harmless the Landlord Indemnified Parties from and against
any and all Losses (defined below) caused by, incurred or resulting from

insurer that such policy shall not be cancelled or modified without at least
ten (10) days prior written notice to Landlord and each Mortgagee, and
contain clauses or endorsements to the effect that no act or negligence of
Tenant, or anyone acting for Tenant, or failure to comply with the provisions
of any policy which might otherwise result in a forfeiture of the insurance
or any part thereof, shall in any way affect the validity or enforceability
of the insurance insofar as Landlord is concerned. The Property Insurance
shall contain a waiver of subrogation by the insurer of any right to recover
the amount of any loss resulting from the acts or negligence of Landlord or
its agents, employees or licensees.

  



  

(g) Each of Landlord and Tenant hereby waives any and every claim for

the negligence of Landlord or Tenant or their respective agents or employees,
which loss or damage is insured pursuant to this Lease (or is required to be
insured pursuant to this Lease); provided, however, that the foregoing waiver
shall not be operative in any case where the effect thereof is to invalidate
any insurance coverage of the waiving party or increase the cost of such
insurance coverage. Each of Landlord and Tenant hereby waive all rights of
subrogation that they may have against each other.

  



  

(h) It is expressly understood and agreed that (i) if any insurance required
hereunder, or any part thereof, shall expire, be withdrawn, become void by

reason of the failure or impairment of the capital of any insurer, Tenant
shall immediately obtain new or additional insurance reasonably satisfactory
to Landlord and its Lender; (ii) the minimum limits of insurance coverage set
forth in this _Section 6.01_ shall not limit the liability of Tenant for its
acts or omissions as provided in this Lease; (iii) Tenant shall procure

provide to Landlord and any servicer or Lender of Landlord certificates of
insurance or, upon Landlords request, duplicate originals of insurance
policies evidencing that insurance satisfying the requirements of this Lease

be amended from time to time (hereinafter each referred individually as an "
_REA_ " and collectively as the " _REAs_ "), and Tenant, for itself and any
permitted assignee or subtenant, hereby covenants and agrees to comply with,
perform all obligations (whether those of Tenant or Landlord) under and not
violate any provision of the REAs. Tenant shall pay or cause to be paid, in a
timely manner, all charges, costs and other obligations imposed on or with
respect to the Premises or Landlord pursuant to any REAs. Neither Landlord
nor Tenant shall grant or agree to any new REA affecting a Property Location
or to any consents, approvals,

  



        
   

  



  

waivers, modifications, amendments or terminations of any REA in existence as
of the Effective Date (collectively, an " _REA Change_ ") without the prior
written consent of the other party in each instance, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided, however, with
respect to the development of previously subdivided outlots owned by Tenant
that are not part of the Premises, Tenant shall have the right to consent to
such outlot development on behalf of Landlord under any REA (or Landlord
shall execute a consent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Landlord, upon the reasonable request of Tenant) so long as Tenant
represents to Landlord that such development does not materially and
adversely affect the use or operation of or access to or from the applicable
Property Location and the development will not (a) cause any portion of such
Property Location to be in violation of any legal requirements, (b) create
any liens on such Property Location, or (c) violate the terms of any document
or instrument of record encumbering such Property Location, including without
limitation, any REA. In any instance in which a party requests the consent of
the other party to an REA Change, the other party shall respond to such
request within twenty (20) days; provided, that if there is no response
within said twenty (20) day period, consent shall be deemed to have been
given upon the expiration of said twenty (20) day period. Landlord agrees
that Tenant shall enjoy the access, parking, easement and right to receive
services benefits that inure to Landlord under all REAs, concerning such
access, parking, easement rights or the right to receive services thereunder.
Landlord hereby grants unto Tenant the rights of enforcement and audit with
respect to all of the REAs on Landlords behalf, at Tenants sole cost and
expense. If Tenant cures a default or enforces performance by the other owner
or other party to an REA in accordance with an REA and in doing so spends
money, or if at the time in question Tenant is performing the common area
maintenance under that REA and the adjacent owner or other party fails to pay
its share of expenses, Landlord grants Tenant, to the extent granted under
the REA, the right to collect reimbursement from the adjacent owner or the
other party to said REA, provided that Landlord shall have no liability to
Tenant with respect to any amounts paid or costs incurred by Tenant. Landlord
agrees that, upon Tenants request and at Tenants sole cost and expense,
Landlord will enforce the terms of any REAs for the benefit of Tenant. Except
to the extent of Landlords willful wrongful acts or gross negligence
(provided that the term "gross negligence" used in this Section shall not
include gross negligence imputed as a matter of law to any of the
Landlord Indemnified Parties solely by reason of Landlords interest in any
Property Location or Tenants failure to act in respect of matters which are
or were the obligation of Tenant under this Lease), Tenant agrees that it
will defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Landlord Indemnified Parties
from and against any and all Losses arising from or related to a default by
Tenant under the REAs, that continues beyond applicable notice and cure
periods, and any enforcement actions described in this Section. Promptly
after the request of Tenant, Landlord shall execute such documents as may be
reasonably requested by Tenant in connection with any REA so that to the
extent permitted by such REA, (i) Tenant is entitled to directly receive any
notices under the REA (with a required copy to Landlord), (ii) Tenant,
together with Landlord, is named as a co-insured under any insurance policies
required to be maintained by any other party under the REA, (iii) Tenant,
together with Landlord, is afforded the benefit of all rights, easements,
licenses and benefits afforded to the Property Location under the REA, and
(iv) Tenant is able to directly enforce and audit the REA and to directly
exercise all rights and remedies in connection with any breach of the REA by
any other party.

  



  

9.05 **_Required Repairs_**. On the Commencement Date, Tenant shall deposit
with Landlord the sum of [ ] **[To be updated
on the Effective Date]** , to complete

  



        
   

  



  

each item of the repairs relating to the Property Locations described on
_Exhibit I_ (the " _Required Repairs_ ") and Landlord shall hold or cause
the Mortgagee to hold such amount for Tenants benefit in an interest-bearing
account (which may be a book entry subaccount) (the " _Required Repairs
Subaccount_ "); all interest thereon shall accrue for the benefit of Tenant.
Tenant shall complete the Required Repairs at the applicable Property
Location on or before the deadline for such Required Repairs as set forth in
_Exhibit I_ **[To be updated on the Effective Date]**. Landlord shall
disburse or cause the Mortgagee to disburse the funds held in the Required
Repairs Subaccount to Tenant, within fifteen (15) days after the delivery by
Tenant to Landlord of a request therefor, in an amount greater than $25,000
(or a lesser amount if the total amount in the Required Repair Subaccount is
less than $25,000, in which case only one disbursement of the amount
remaining in the account shall be made), accompanied by the following items:
(a) a certificate signed by an officer of Tenant: (i) stating that the
Required Repair which is the subject of the requested disbursement has been
completed, (ii) identifying each Person that supplied materials or labor in
connection with such Required Repairs or any portion thereof, and (iii)
stating that each such Person supplying materials or labor has been or, upon
receipt of the requested disbursement, will be paid in full with respect to
the portion of the Required Repairs which is the subject of the requested
disbursement; (b) copies of appropriate lien waivers, to the extent
applicable, or other evidence of payment reasonably satisfactory to Landlord;
and (c) if requested by Landlords Lender, a title search for such Property
Location indicating that such Property Location is free from all liens,
claims and other encumbrances not previously approved by Landlord. Landlord
shall be obligated to make disbursements from the Required Repair Subaccount
with respect to a Property Location in the amount allocated for such Property
Location set forth in _Exhibit I_ (even if the cost to complete such work is
less than the amount set forth in _Exhibit I_) but Landlord shall not be
obligated to make disbursements in excess of the amount allocated for
Property Location as set forth in _Exhibit I_. If Tenant does not complete
the Required Repairs at the applicable Property Location by the required
deadline for such Required Repairs, then Landlord may apply such funds to
completion of such Required Repairs. Upon Tenants completion of all Required
Repairs in accordance with this Section, Landlord shall release or cause
Mortgagee to release any funds remaining in the Required Repairs Subaccount,
if any, to Tenant.

  



  

9.06 **_Warranties_**. Landlord hereby assigns, without recourse or warranty
whatsoever, to Tenant (to the extent assignable), (a) all claims against
third parties for damages to the Premises to the extent that such damages are
Tenants responsibility to repair pursuant to the provisions of this Lease,
and (b) all warranties, guaranties and indemnities, express or implied, and
similar rights which Landlord may have against any manufacturer, seller,
engineer, contractor or builder in respect of any of the Property Locations,
including, but not limited to, any rights and remedies existing under
contract or pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code (collectively, the "
_Warranties_ "). Tenant shall take all commercially reasonable action
necessary to preserve the rights under the Warranties assigned hereunder.
Upon the occurrence of a Default and the Landlords exercise of its remedies
under _Section 16.02_ hereof or the expiration or sooner termination of this
Lease, the Warranties shall automatically revert to Landlord. The foregoing
provision of reversion shall be self-operative and no further instrument of
reassignment shall be required.

  



        
   

  



  

 **ARTICLE 10. 
 RIGHTS RESERVED TO LANDLORD**

  

 ** **

  

Landlord reserves the right, exercisable without notice and without liability
to Tenant for damage or injury to property, Person or business and without
effecting an eviction or disturbance of Tenants use or possession or giving
rise to any claim for setoff or abatement of rent or affecting any of
Tenants obligations under this Lease, (a) at any time during 120 days prior
to the expiration of the Term, to exhibit each Property Location at
reasonable hours upon prior notice to Tenant and giving Tenant the
opportunity to have its representative accompany the group performing such
exhibition, and (b) to decorate, remodel, repair, alter or otherwise prepare
each Property Location for re-occupancy at any time after a Default by Tenant
under this Lease and Tenant surrenders the Premises to Landlord.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 11. 
 ALTERATIONS**

  

 ** **

  

11.01 **_Alterations_**. Tenant shall have the sole and complete right and
authority, without Landlords consent or approval but subject to the
provisions contained in any REAs and Overleases relating to alterations, to
alter or change each Property Location in any way, including, without
limitation, dividing each Property Location (excluding any subdivision of any
land) and adding additional signage; provided that (a) Tenant gives Landlord
prior written notice of any material alterations, and (b) at any one time
Tenant may not make any proposed structural alterations to any Property
Location in excess of **[ShopKo $2,000,000] [Pamida - $750,000]** for each
Property Location per Lease Year, increased annually based on increases in
the CPI (as hereinafter defined in _Section 31.16_) (the " _Alteration Cap_
"), without Landlords prior written consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably, withheld, conditioned or delayed, it being understood,
however, that the refusal or failure of Landlords Lender to grant consent
(to the extent required and applicable) to the alterations shall be a
reasonable basis for Landlord to withhold its consent. For the purposes of
this Lease, the term "structural" shall mean the roof, foundation or load-
bearing walls of any Building. In addition, Tenant shall not demolish,
replace or materially alter any structural or non-structural portions of any
Building or any other improvements located on a Property Location, or any
part thereof, or make any addition thereto, whether voluntary or in
connection with a repair or Restoration (as defined in _Section
14.01_) required by this Lease (collectively, the " _Capital Improvement_ "),
unless Tenant shall comply with the following requirements:

  



  

(a) Each Capital Improvement, when completed, shall be of such a character as
not to materially reduce the value of the applicable Property Location below
its value immediately before construction of such Capital Improvement was
commenced;

  



  

(b) Each Capital Improvement shall be made with reasonable diligence (subject
to Force Majeure, as hereinafter defined in _Section 31.10_) and in a good
and workmanlike manner and in compliance with all applicable permits
and authorizations and, as applicable, any of the REAs and Overleases. No
Capital Improvement shall impair the safety or structural integrity of the
applicable Building;

  



        
   

  



  

(c) In connection with the construction of any Capital Improvement, the
applicable Property Location and the assets of Landlord shall (subject to the
provisions of _Article 26_) at all times be free of liens for work,
services, labor and materials supplied or claimed to have been supplied to
the applicable Property Location;

  



  

(d) No structural Capital Improvement shall be undertaken without obtaining
the insurance required by _Section 6.01_ hereof, and "all risk" builders
risk property insurance for the full replacement cost of the subject Capital
Improvement on a completed value basis;

  



  

(e) No Capital Improvement shall be undertaken until Tenant shall have
procured and paid for, insofar as the same may be required from time to time,
all permits and authorizations of all governmental authorities for such
Capital Improvement. Landlord shall join in the application for such permit
or authorization and cooperate with Tenant and execute any additional
documents as may be necessary to allow Tenant to complete the alterations and
changes, provided it is made without cost, liability, obligation or expense
to Landlord. Tenant agrees that it will defend, indemnify and hold harmless
the Landlord Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses arising
from or related to construction of any Capital Improvements and any failure
to comply with the requirements in connection with a Capital Improvement as
described in this Section;

  



  

(f) All Capital Improvements shall be deemed a part of the Premises and,
except as set forth in _Section 7.02_, belong to Landlord at the expiration
or early termination of the Term, and Tenant shall execute and deliver to
Landlord such instruments as Landlord may require to evidence the ownership
by Landlord of such Capital Improvements; and

  



  

(g) Excluding Capital Improvements required as a result of any condemnation
or casualty, the maximum costs of Capital Improvements that are not
substantially complete or not fully paid for by Tenant, at any one time,
shall not exceed **[ShopKo - $30,000,000] [Pamida - $7,500,000]**.

  



  

Upon completion of the Capital Improvements, Tenant shall promptly provide
Landlord with (i) an architects certificate certifying that the Capital
Improvements have been completed in conformity with the plans and
specifications therefor (if the alterations are of such a nature as would
customarily require the issuance of such certificate from an architect), (ii)
a certificate of occupancy (if the alterations are of such a nature as would
require the issuance of a certificate of occupancy under applicable law), and
(iii) any other documents or information reasonably requested by Landlord.

12.01 **_Assignment_**. (a) Subject to _Section 12.07_ below, Tenant shall
have the right to assign or transfer this Lease, either wholly or in part, or

no more than ten percent (10%) of the total aggregate of the (a) rentable
square footage of the Property Locations that are used for retail purposes

calculations attached thereto and] and, if applicable, that the conditions
set forth in _Section 12.01(b)_ below have been satisfied; (ii) Landlord
shall enter into a separate lease with assignee as to that portion of the
Premises assigned upon substantially the same terms and conditions as this
Lease (except for such provisions which by their terms are not applicable to

rent per square foot of the portion of the Premises assigned is equal to or
greater than the rent as determined in accordance with _Exhibit B_ attached
hereto and made a part hereof, (2) the lease term for such assignment is at

the Premises which has been assigned to a third party by Tenant in accordance
with and pursuant to the requirements of the provisions of this _Section
12.01_ (an " _Assigned Lease_ ") and (2) no default under an Assigned
Lease shall constitute a Default under this Lease and no Default under this
Lease shall constitute a default under an Assigned Lease, and (iv) this
Lease shall be amended to release such Property Location from this Lease and
to reduce the Base Rent by the amount of the rent paid by the assignee, with
all other terms and conditions of this Lease remaining in full force and
effect.

to the continuing limitations set forth in Section 12.07 below, as to that
portion of the Premises assigned, Tenants obligations under this Lease shall
terminate entirely and, except for any liabilities of Tenant which accrued
prior to the date of assignment, Tenant shall be released of any liability

however, that Tenant may satisfy any one of the foregoing conditions of
assignee by providing, or causing to be provided, a guaranty agreement, in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to and approved by Landlord, in
writing, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, which
guaranty shall be from an entity that meets the requirements of (i), (ii) or
(iii) set forth above in this _Section 12.01(b)_.

  



  

12.02 **_Change of Control_**. The following transactions, transfers or
changes in control or ownership of Tenant shall not constitute an assignment
under the terms of this Lease: (a) a transfer of Tenants entire interest in
this Lease to any entity in connection with intercompany corporate transfers
whose ownership is controlled by Tenant or Tenants parent or ultimate
parent; or (b) a transfer of Tenants entire interest in this Lease to any

sale of substantially all of the stock of Tenant; or (f) a sale of
substantially all of the assets of Tenant to a single entity that expressly
assumes this Lease; or (g) a similar intercompany transaction to those

transactions described in items (a), (b), (c) and (g) above of this Section,
Tenant shall remain liable under this Lease. With respect to each of the
transactions described in items (d), (e), (f) and (h) above of this Section,
Tenants obligations under this Lease shall terminate entirely and Tenant
shall be released of any liability under this Lease, except for
any liabilities of Tenant which accrued prior to the date of such
transaction.

  



  

12.03 **_Subletting and Non-Disturbance_**. Subject to _Section 12.07_
below, Tenant shall have the right to sublet any portion of the Premises,
without Landlords consent or approval, so long as Tenant shall remain liable
under this Lease and Tenant delivers notice thereof to Landlord along with a
copy of any such sublease. Upon the request of Tenant from time to time, if
(a) the terms of a sublease were negotiated on an arms length basis with a
third party not affiliated with Tenant; (b) the base minimum rent per square
foot of the portion of the Premises sublet for the term of such sublease is
equal to or greater than the amount as determined in accordance with _Exhibit
B_; (c) the terms of the sublease shall have substantially the same terms and
conditions as this Lease, including, without limitation, the same lease term,
rent escalations, covenants, escrows and reserves and financial reporting
requirements (except for such provisions which by their terms are not
applicable to such Premises sublet); (d) the tenant under the sublease at
the time of the sublease (i) has an investment rating of BBB or better from
Standard and Poors (or an equivalent rating or shadow rating from another
nationally recognized statistical rating service) or (ii) at the time of the
proposed sublease, is a reputable, creditworthy tenant [and ShopKo only 
meets or exceeds an EBITDAR Ratio of 1.25 to 1]; or (iii) at the time of the
proposed sublease, has a Tangible Net Worth of at least [ShopKo -
$25,000,000; **** Pamida - $15,000,000] (provided, however, that Tenant may
satisfy any one of the foregoing conditions of tenant under the sublease set
forth in (d)(i), (ii) or (iii) above by providing, or causing to be provided,
a guaranty (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to and approved by
Landlord in writing, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) from an entity that meets any of the foregoing requirements), (e)
the sublease contains no other material provisions that (i) benefit the
subtenant and are unusual for a "market" sublease of the type in question and
(ii) are materially adverse to a landlord, and (f) Tenant provides Landlord
with an officers certificate of Tenant certifying compliance with the
criteria in _subsections (a) through (e)_, and attaching a schedule of rent
calculations and other details supporting the certifications, in the form
attached hereto as _Schedule 12.03_, then Landlord shall execute and deliver
to such subtenant a written agreement, substantially in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit D_, to the effect that, notwithstanding the termination
of this Lease or Tenants possessory and other rights and obligations under
this Lease by Landlord, such subtenant and the rights of subtenant under any
sublease shall not be disturbed by Landlord but shall continue in full force

  



        
   

  



  

and effect, Landlord shall assume the obligations of the landlord under
the sublease so long as such subtenant shall continue to observe and perform
all of its obligations under a sublease, and the provisions of Section
_16.01(j)_  or any other Default under this Lease shall not apply to any such
sublease (an " _NDA_ "). For avoidance of doubt, the payment by Tenant to a
subtenant of a tenant allowance at the execution of the sublease shall not be
considered unusual. In the event of a termination of this Lease, any sublease
for which a NDA has been executed and delivered by Landlord shall continue in
full force and effect as a direct lease between Landlord and subtenant.
Landlord agrees to execute, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its Mortgagee to execute, such documentation as may be reasonably
required to effectuate the non-disturbance contemplated herein, including,
without limitation, estoppel letters, recognition agreements and non-
disturbance agreements, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
D_.

  



  

12.04 **_Assignment by Landlord_**. As a material inducement to Landlords
willingness to complete the transactions contemplated by this Lease (the "
_Transaction_ "), Tenant hereby agrees that Landlord may, from time to time
and at any time and without the consent of Tenant, engage in all or any
combination of the following, or enter into agreements in connection with any
of the following or in accordance with requirements that may be imposed by
applicable securities, tax or other laws: (a) the sale, assignment,
grant, conveyance, transfer, financing, re-financing, purchase or re-
acquisition in whole, but not part, of the Premises or this Lease, Landlords
right, title and interest in this Lease, the servicing rights with respect to
any of the foregoing, or participations in any of the foregoing, provided,
however, in no event may Landlord disclose or permit the disclosure of the
financial information described in _Section 31.17(g)_ (except as
otherwise provided therein) to any potential purchaser, assignee, transferee
or lender that owns or can direct the management, directly or indirectly, of
five (5) or more commonly managed retail locations; or (b) a Securitization
(defined below) and related transactions. Without in any way limiting the
foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that Landlord, in its sole
discretion, may assign this Lease or any interest herein to another Person
(including without limitation, a taxable REIT subsidiary) in order to
maintain Landlords or any of its affiliates status as a REIT. In the event
of any such sale or assignment other than a security assignment, Tenant shall
attorn to such purchaser or assignee (so long as Landlord and such purchaser
or assignee notify Tenant in writing of such transfer and such purchaser or
assignee expressly assumes in writing the obligations of Landlord hereunder).
At the request of Landlord, Tenant will execute such documents confirming the
sale, assignment or other transfer and such other agreements as Landlord may
reasonably request, provided that the same do not increase the liabilities
and obligations, or decrease the rights, of Tenant hereunder in any
manner whatsoever, and Landlord shall reimburse the reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by Tenant related to the execution and delivery of such
documents, provided that such costs and expenses are in excess of the costs
and expenses Tenant may incur in connection with the performance of its
obligations under this Lease. Landlord shall be relieved, from and after the
date of such transfer or conveyance, of liability for the performance of any
obligation of Landlord contained herein, except for obligations or
liabilities accrued prior to such assignment or sale.

  



  

12.05 **_Substitution_**. Subject to _Section 12.07_ below, Tenant shall
have the right to substitute like-kind assets for the Property Locations;
provided, however, that (i) Tenant shall not have any such substitution right
if the substitution of any Property Location would cause Landlord to
recognize income or gain from a "prohibited transaction" as defined under
Section 857(b)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as the same may be
amended from time

  



        
   

  



  

to time (the " _Code_ ") or such substituted like-kind asset is not
"real property" under Section 856 of the Code, and (ii) Landlord may
irrevocably elect to retain the Property Locations that Tenant requests for
substitution. If Tenant elects to conduct a substitution such that another
unencumbered property location or locations (the " _Substitute Property_ ")
is substituted for a Property Location being released:

  



  

(a) Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for substitution fees, costs and expenses
(including without limitation, fees and expenses related to legal opinions)
charged by Landlords Lender and other out-of-pocket fees and costs
reasonably and actually incurred by Landlord in connection with such
substitution;

  



  

(b) Subject to the requirements set forth in this _Section 12.05_, Landlord
covenants that it shall provide Tenant with such cooperation as Tenant may
reasonably request to qualify any exercise by Tenant of a substitution right
under this _Section 12.05_ as a transaction qualifying under Section 1031 of
the Code, provided, however, that (i) Landlord shall not be obligated to pay,
suffer or incur any additional expenses or liabilities as a result of
cooperating in Tenants exchange and Landlord shall not be obligated to
acquire any other real property in connection with Tenants exchange; (ii)
Landlord shall not have any liability to Tenant for failure of the exchange
to qualify under the Code; (iii) except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Lease, any assignment(s) made by Tenant in connection with such exchange
shall not relieve Tenant of its obligations under this Lease; and (iv) the
completion of one or more tax-deferred exchanges is _not_ a condition to the
performance by Tenant of the obligations of Tenant set forth in this Lease;
and

  



  

(c) The substitution shall comply with the substitution requirements, if any,
of Landlords Lender related to substitution, as well as the following:

  



  

(i) the Substitute Property shall be made subject to this Lease with no
decline in Base Rent or any other Rent due hereunder;

  



  

(ii) the appraised value of the Substitute Property shall be equal to or
greater than the appraised value of the Property Location being released;

  



  

(iii) the Substitute Property shall have a store level profitability equal to
or greater than the store level profitability of the Property Location being
released;

  



  

(iv) to the extent required by its Lender, Landlord shall have obtained (1)
the written consent of its Lender to such substitution, and (2) confirmation
from each statistical rating agency that has assigned a rating to securities
sold in any Securitization (defined below) in which any loan related to a
Mortgage has been included that such Substitute Property shall not result in
the downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of any securities backed by such
respective loan;

  



  

(v) no Default under this Lease has occurred and is continuing;

  



  

(vi) the Property Location being substituted shall be released from this
Lease;

  



        
   

  



  

(vii) with respect to the Substitute Property, Landlord and its Lender shall
have received an engineering report and an environmental report acceptable to
Landlord and its Lender; and

  



  

(viii) Landlord shall have received an officers certificate of Tenant
certifying that the square footage of the Substitute Property complies with
the provisions in _Section 12.07_ hereof, along with square footage
calculations in support thereof.

  



  

12.06 **_Concessionaires_**. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Tenant shall have the right, without Landlords consent or approval, to
sublease or license up to ten percent (10%) of the rentable square footage of
each Property Location to concessionaires consistent with Tenants typical
store operations, including without limitation, the existing license
agreement between Tenant and Payless dated July 23, 1999, as amended;
provided that (a) the term of such sublease or license shall not extend
beyond the period that ends one day before the expiration of the Term; and
(b) Tenant (i) gives Landlord written notice thereof, (ii) makes commercially
reasonable efforts to provide to Landlord copies of any such subleases or
licenses (provided that the failure to deliver the same shall not constitute
a default by Tenant under this Lease), and (iii) provides Landlord with an
officers certificate of Tenant certifying that the foregoing square footage
restrictions have not been breached, along with a schedule of square footage
calculations in support thereof attached thereto. Any sublease or licenses to
concessionaires shall not count towards the limits against subletting set
forth in _Section 12.07_ below.

  



  

12.07 **_Limits on Assignment, Subletting and
Substitution_**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Lease and without in any way eliminating or diminishing Tenants obligation
to comply with all Legal Requirements or its obligations hereunder, (a) the
maximum amount of rentable square footage in this Lease that can be assigned,
sublet or substituted in any one (1) year is limited to twenty percent (20%)
of the aggregate rentable square footage of the Buildings and the maximum
amount of rentable square footage in this Lease that can be assigned, sublet
or substituted over the Term is limited to thirty percent (30%) of the
aggregate rentable square footage of the Buildings; provided, however that
the limits set forth in this _Section 12.07_ shall not apply to subleases
or assignments with respect to (i) any Property Locations for which
the Tenant is permitted to "go dark" pursuant to _Section 4.01_, or (ii)
any concessionaire as described in _Section 12.06_, or (iii) except with
respect to Store No. 3852 in Bethany, Missouri, any subleases existing as of
the Effective Date; and (b) any attempted assignment, subletting or
substitution in violation of this _Section 12.07_ shall be deemed null and
void, and of no force or effect. Furthermore, Tenant shall not have the right
to assign or sublet all or any portion of the Buildings unless Tenant shall
have provided to Landlord, immediately prior to the effective date of such
assignment or sublease, an officers certificate (the " _Assignment or
Sublease Officer s Certificate_") signed by an officer of the assignee
or sublessee certifying that none of the parties identified by Landlord as a
10% shareholder of Landlord (on a written list certified by Landlord and to
be provided to Tenant following the request of Tenant in connection with
any proposed assignment or sublease) owns, directly or, to the assignees
or sublessees actual knowledge after such assignee or

  



        
   

  



  

sublessee has made inquiry of its officer or similar person that is
responsible for maintaining records regarding the direct ownership of such
assignee or sublessee, indirectly, (1) ten percent (10%) or more of the total
combined voting power of all classes of voting capital stock of the assignee
or sublessee, as the case may be, or (2) ten percent (10%) or more of the
total value of all classes of capital stock of the assignee or sublessee, as
the case may be. Landlord shall provide the written list described in the
preceding sentence within five (5) business days of written request therefore
by Tenant and, in the absence of timely provision of such list,
such officers certificate shall be based on the latest written list
delivered by Landlord to Tenant.

 WAIVER OF CERTAIN CLAIMS; INDEMNITY BY TENANT**

  

 ** **

  

13.01 **_Waiver of Certain Claims_**. Except as otherwise required under
applicable law or to the extent of Landlords willful wrongful acts or gross
negligence (provided that the term "gross negligence" used throughout this
_Article 13_ shall not include gross negligence imputed as a matter of law
to any of the Landlord Indemnified Parties (as hereinafter defined in
_Section 13.03(a)_) solely by reason of Landlords interest in any Property
Location or Tenants failure to act in respect of matters which are or were
the obligation of Tenant under this Lease), but in all events, subject to the
waiver of claims and subrogation set forth in this Lease, the Landlord
Indemnified Parties shall not in any event whatsoever (a) be liable for any
injury or damage to Tenant or any third party happening in, on or about the
Premises, nor for any injury or damage to the Premises or to any property
belonging to Tenant or any third party which may be caused by any fire or
breakage or by any other cause whatsoever or by the use, misuse or abuse of
any of the Buildings or any other improvements at a Property Location or
which may arise from any other cause whatsoever; nor (b) be liable to Tenant
or any third party for any failure of water supply, gas, telephone or
electric current, nor for any injury or damage to any property of Tenant or
to the Premises caused by or resulting from gasoline, oil, steam, gas or
electricity or hurricane, tornado, flood, wind or similar storms or
disturbances, or water, rain, sleet, ice or snow which may leak or flow from
the street, sewer, gas mains or subsurface area or from any part of the
Premises, or leakage of gasoline or oil from pipes, storage tanks,
appliances, sewers or plumbing works therein, or from any other place or from
any other cause, nor for interference with light or other incorporeal
hereditaments by anybody, or caused by any public or quasi-public work.

  



  

13.02 **_Tenant Responsible for Personal Property_**. All Tenants Personalty
and other personal property belonging to any occupant of any Property
Location that is in the applicable Building or the remainder of such Property

Landlord shall not be liable for damage thereto or theft or misappropriation
thereof.

  



  

13.03 **_Indemnification_**.

  



  

(a) Tenant agrees to use and occupy the Premises at its own risk and hereby
releases the Landlord Indemnified Parties from all claims for any damage or
injury to the full extent permitted by law. Except to the extent of
Landlords willful wrongful acts or gross negligence and without in any way
limiting Tenants other indemnification obligations under this Lease
(including without limitation, those set forth in _Sections 9.04, 11.01(e),
25.08 and 32.01_), Tenant shall (promptly as incurred or upon demand by any
Landlord Indemnified Party) indemnify, save, protect, defend and hold
harmless Landlord and any agent, beneficiary, representative, contractor,
manager, member, director, employee, Landlord, mortgagee, officer,

  



        
   

  



  

director, parent, partner, shareholder, trustee, affiliate, subsidiary,
participant, successors and assigns of Landlord (collectively, with Landlord,
the " _Landlord Indemnified Parties_ ", and each, a " _Landlord Indemnified
Party_ ") from and against any and all liabilities, suits, obligations,
fines, damages, penalties, claims, costs, charges and expenses, including,
without limitation, reasonable engineers, architects and attorneys fees,
court costs and disbursements, which may be imposed upon or incurred by any
Landlord Indemnified Party during or after (but attributable to a period of
time falling within) the Term caused by, incurred or resulting from Tenants
operations or by Tenants use and occupancy of the Premises, whether relating
to its original design or construction, latent defects, alteration,
maintenance, use by Tenant or any Person thereon.

  



  

(b) Landlord shall indemnify, save, protect, defend and hold harmless Tenant
and any agent, beneficiary, representative, contractor, manager, member,
director, employee, Landlord, mortgagee, officer, director, parent, partner,
shareholder, trustee, affiliate, subsidiary, participant, successors and
assigns of Tenant (collectively the " _Tenant Indemnified Parties_ " and
each, a " _Tenant Indemnified Party_ "; the Tenant Indemnified Party and the
Landlord Indemnified Party shall be collectively called the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") harmless from and against any and all liabilities, suits,
obligations, fines, damages, penalties, claims, costs, charges and expenses,
including, without limitation, reasonable engineers, architects and
attorneys fees, court costs and disbursements, which may be imposed upon or
incurred by or asserted against any Tenant Indemnified Party by reason of any
willful wrongful act or gross negligence by Landlord pursuant to or in
connection with this Lease or Landlords repossession of the Premises.

  



  

(c) The obligations of Tenant and Landlord under this _Article 13_ shall not
be affected in any way by the absence in any case of covering insurance or by
the failure or refusal of any insurance carrier to perform any obligation on
its part under insurance policies affecting the Premises or any part thereof.

  



  

(d) If any claim, action or proceeding is made or brought against any
Indemnified Party against which it is indemnified pursuant to this _Section

claim, action or proceeding is covered by insurance), otherwise by such
attorneys as the Indemnified Party shall approve, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  



  

(e) The provisions of this _Section 13.03_ shall survive for a period of
five (5) years after the Expiration Date or earlier termination of this
Lease.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 14. 
 USE OF CASUALTY INSURANCE PROCEEDS**

  

 ** **

  

14.01 **_Tenant s Obligation to Restore_**. If all or any part of the
improvements on any Property Location shall be destroyed or damaged in whole
or in part by fire or other casualty (whether or not insured) of any kind or
nature, ordinary or extraordinary, foreseen or unforeseen (a " _Casualty
Event_ "), Tenant shall give Landlord prompt written notice thereof, and
Tenant, with reasonable diligence (subject to Force Majeure), shall repair,
alter, restore, replace and rebuild

  



        
   

  



  

(collectively, " _Restore_ " or " _Restoration_ ") the same, as nearly as
practicable to the character of the improvements on such Property Location
existing immediately prior to such occurrence, and in no event shall Landlord
be called upon to Restore the improvements on such Property Location, as now
or hereafter existing, or any portion thereof or to pay any of the costs or
expenses thereof. If Tenant is required to but shall fail or neglect to
Restore with reasonable diligence (subject to Force Majeure) the improvements
on such Property Location or the portion thereof damaged or destroyed, or,
having so commenced such Restoration, shall fail to complete the same with
reasonable diligence (subject to Force Majeure) in accordance with the terms
of this Lease, Landlord may (but shall not be obligated to), after thirty
(30) days prior written notice to Tenant and Tenants failure to commence or
re-commence such Restoration, complete such Restoration at Tenants expense,
plus Default Interest.

  



  

In the event the insurance proceeds after deduction of any reasonable costs
and expenses, if any, incurred by Tenant, Landlord or a Lender in collecting
the same (collectively, " _Net Insurance Proceeds_ ") of any Casualty Event
are less than **[One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00)  ShopKo][Three Hundred
Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($375,000.00)  Pamida]** (the " _Restoration
Threshold_ "), Landlord shall disburse, or cause to be disbursed, to Tenant
such Net Insurance Proceeds. In the event the Net Insurance Proceeds are
greater than the Restoration Threshold, Landlord shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to disburse or cause Lender to disburse such Net Insurance
Proceeds within ten (10) days upon Landlord being furnished with (i) evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Landlord of the estimated cost of completion of
the Restoration, (ii) such architects certificates, waivers of lien,
contractors sworn statements, mortgagees title insurance endorsements,
bonds, plats of survey, permits, approvals, licenses and such other documents
and items as Landlord may reasonably require and approve in Landlords
reasonable discretion, and (iii) all plans and specifications for such
Restoration, such plans and specifications to be approved by Landlord prior
to commencement of any work, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, that, in any event, Landlord
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to diligently provide or cause
Lender to diligently provide its written approval or disapproval
(with reasons of sufficient specificity to allow Tenant to correct the
reasonable objection) following Landlords receipt of such plans and
specifications. Landlord may, at Tenants reasonable expense, retain a
consultant to review and approve all requests for disbursements, which
approval shall also be a condition precedent to any disbursement, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
provided, that, in any event, Landlord shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the consultant to diligently provide its written approval or
disapproval (with reasons of sufficient specificity to allow Tenant to
correct the reasonable objection) following such consultants and/or
Landlords receipt of Tenants request for disbursement. No payment made
prior to the final completion of the Restoration shall exceed ninety percent
(90%) of the value of the work performed; funds other than the Net Insurance
Proceeds shall be disbursed prior to disbursement of such Net Insurance
Proceeds; and at all times, the undisbursed balance of such Net Insurance
Proceeds then held by Landlord, together with funds deposited for that
purpose or irrevocably committed to the reasonable satisfaction of Landlord
by or on behalf of Tenant for that purpose, shall be at least sufficient in
the reasonable judgment of Landlord to pay for the cost of completion of the
Restoration, free and clear of all liens or claims for a lien. Prior to the
disbursement of any portion of the Net Insurance Proceeds, Tenant shall
provide evidence reasonably satisfactory to Landlord of the payment
of Restoration expenses by Tenant up to the amount of the insurance
deductible applicable to such Casualty Event. Landlord shall be entitled

  



        
   

  



  

to keep any portion of the Net Insurance Proceeds which may be in excess of
the cost of Restoration, and Tenant shall bear all additional costs and
expense of such Restoration in excess of the Net Insurance Proceeds.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 14.01 to the contrary, if, at the
time of a Casualty Event, Tenant fails to meet an EBITDAR Ratio (as
hereinafter defined in _Section 30.06(c)_) of 1.15 to 1 calculated on a
trailing twelve (12) month basis at the time of such test, then Landlord
shall have the right after the Casualty Event to withhold the applicable
insurance proceeds for the Restoration if, at Lenders election, Lender
desires to apply the insurance proceeds relating to such Casualty Event to
the payment of Landlords Mortgage (a " _Casualty Withholding Event_ ").
Promptly upon Landlords receipt of notice from Lender of a Casualty
Withholding Event (provided that Landlord shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause Lender to notify it as soon as possible of a decision),
Lender shall provide written notice thereof to Tenant.

  



  

14.02 **_No Abatement of Rent_**. Except as otherwise provided in _Sections
14.03 and 14.04_ below, this Lease shall not terminate, be forfeited or be
affected in any manner, nor shall there be any reduction or abatement of the
Rent payable hereunder, by reason of damage to or total, substantial or
partial destruction of any Building or any part thereof or the improvements
on any Property Location or any part thereof, or by reason of the
untenantability of the same or any part thereof, for or due to any reason or
cause whatsoever, and Tenant, notwithstanding any law or statute present or
future, waives any and all rights to quit or surrender any Property Location
or any part thereof; and Tenants obligations hereunder, including without
limitation, the payment of Rent hereunder, shall continue as though the
improvements on such Property Location had not been damaged or destroyed and
without abatement, suspension, diminution or reduction of any kind.

  



  

14.03 **_Right to Terminate_**. Notwithstanding any other provision to the
contrary contained in this _Article 14_, in the event that, as a result of
such fire or other casualty, (1) Tenant shall reasonably estimate in the
exercise of good faith business judgment that (a) the applicable Property
Location cannot be used for the same purpose and substantially with the same
utility as before such fire or other casualty, or (b) it will be unable to
use such damaged Property Location for the customary operation of Tenants
business for more than (i) one (1) year, or (ii) one hundred twenty (120)
days if such fire or casualty has occurred in the last two (2) years of the
Term or any extension of the Term, or (2) Landlord elects not to provide the
insurance proceeds from any Casualty Event to Tenant in accordance with a
Casualty Withholding Event under Section 14.01, then, subject to the terms
and conditions hereinafter set forth, Tenant shall have the right,
exercisable by written notice given to Landlord no later than thirty (30)
days following such fire or other casualty, to cause Landlord to modify this
Lease to remove the damaged Property Location (and reduce the Rent pursuant
to the terms of Section 14.04 below) and, following such removal, Tenant
shall have no further responsibility to Landlord with respect to such damaged
Property Location, except for such indemnity or other provisions of this
Lease which may relate to such damaged Property Location. Such modification
shall not be effective, and Tenants obligation to pay Rent hereunder shall
continue, until and unless (I) Tenant has complied with all obligations
pursuant to _Article 6_ hereof, (II) Tenant has paid to Landlord all Rent
and other amounts payable with respect to the damaged Property Location, and
(III) Tenant has paid or has caused to be paid to Landlord as its interests
may appear all insurance proceeds which shall have been paid to Tenant with
respect to the destruction or damage of such Property Location and not
utilized towards the Restoration; provided, however, that Tenant shall retain

  



        
   

  



  

those insurance proceeds in which Landlord does not have an interest
including, but not limited to, Tenants Personalty, and ordinary payroll
insurance proceeds.

  



  

14.04 **_Reduction of Rent_**. Upon removal of a Property Location pursuant
to _Section 14.03_ above, the Base Rent shall be reduced by the amount as
determined in accordance with _Exhibit B_.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 15. 
 EMINENT DOMAIN**

  

 ** **

  

15.01 **_Taking: Lease to Terminate_**. If a substantial portion of
a Building or a Parcel shall be lawfully taken as a result of the exercise of
the power of eminent domain or condemned for a public or quasi-public use
or purpose by any competent authority or sold to the condemning authority
under threat of condemnation (collectively, a " _Condemnation_ "), and (1)
Tenant reasonably estimates in the exercise of good faith business judgment
that, as a result thereof, the applicable Property Location cannot be used
for the same purpose and substantially with the same utility as before such
taking or conveyance or (2) Landlord elects not to provide the Condemnation
proceeds from any Condemnation to Tenant in accordance with a Condemnation
Withholding Event under Section 15.02 below, Tenant shall have the right to
cause Landlord to modify this Lease to remove the taken Property Location
(whereupon such removal of a Property Location the Base Rent shall be reduced
by the amount as determined in accordance with _Exhibit B_. If this Lease
is so modified pursuant to this _Section 15.01_, then, upon the date
of such taking of possession, Tenant shall have no further responsibility
to Landlord with respect to such Property Location except for such indemnity
or other provisions of this Lease which by their nature may relate to
such Property Location. Landlord shall be entitled to receive the
entire Condemnation award relating to the land and improvements with respect
to such taking.

  



  

15.02 **_Taking: Lease to Continue_**. In the event only a part of a
Property Location shall be taken as a result of a Condemnation, Tenant
reasonably estimates in the exercise of good faith business judgment that, as
a result thereof, the balance of such Property Location can be used for the
same purpose and with substantially the same utility as before such
Condemnation, this Lease shall not be modified and Tenant shall promptly
repair and restore such Property Location, subject to Force Majeure. In the
event the proceeds of the Condemnation after deduction of any reasonable
costs and expenses, if any, incurred by Tenant, Landlord or a Lender in
collecting the same (collectively, "Net Condemnation Proceeds") are less than
the Restoration Threshold, Landlord shall disburse, or cause to be disbursed,
the Net Condemnation Proceeds to Tenant. In the event the Net Condemnation
Proceeds are greater than the Restoration Threshold, Landlord shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to disburse and/or cause Lender to
expeditiously disburse such Net Condemnation Proceeds upon Landlord being
furnished with (i) evidence satisfactory to Landlord of the estimated cost of
completion of the repair or restoration, (ii) such architects certificates,
waivers of lien, contractors sworn statements, mortgagees title insurance
endorsements, bonds, plats of survey, permits, approvals, licenses and such
other documents and items as Landlord may reasonably require and approve in
Landlords reasonable discretion, and (iii) all plans and specifications for
such repair or restoration, such plans and specifications to be approved by
Landlord prior to commencement of any work, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, that, in any event,

  



        
   

  



  

Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to diligently provide or
cause Lender to diligently provide its written approval or disapproval (with
reasons of sufficient specificity to allow Tenant to correct the reasonable
objection) following Landlords receipt of such plans and specifications.
Landlord may, at Tenants reasonable expense, retain a consultant to review
and approve all requests for disbursements, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, that, in any event,
Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the consultant to
diligently provide its written approval or disapproval (with reasons of
sufficient specificity to allow Tenant to correct the reasonable objection)
following such consultants and/or Landlords receipt of Tenants request for
disbursement. No payment made prior to the final completion of the repair or
restoration shall exceed ninety percent (90%) of the value of the work
performed; funds other than the Net Condemnation Proceeds shall be disbursed
prior to disbursement of such Net Condemnation Proceeds; and at all times,
the undisbursed balance of such Net Condemnation Proceeds then held by
Landlord, together with funds deposited for that purpose or irrevocably
committed to the reasonable satisfaction of Landlord by or on behalf of
Tenant for that purpose, shall be at least sufficient in the reasonable
judgment of Landlord to pay for the cost of completion of the repair or
restoration, free and clear of all liens or claims for a lien. Landlord shall
be entitled to keep any portion of the net proceeds from Condemnation which
may be in excess of the cost of the repair or restoration, and Tenant shall
bear all additional costs and expense of such repair or restoration in excess
of the net proceeds from Condemnation. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 15.02 to the contrary, if, at the time of a Condemnation, Tenant
fails to meet an EBITDAR Ratio (as hereinafter defined in Section
30.06(c)) of 1.15 to 1 calculated on a trailing twelve (12) month basis at
the time of such test, then Landlord shall have the right after the
Condemnation to withhold the Net Condemnation Proceeds for the restoration
and repair if, at Lenders election, Lender desires to apply the insurance
proceeds relating to such Condemnation to the payment of Landlords Mortgage
(a " _Condemnation Withholding Event_ "). Promptly upon Landlords receipt of
notice from Lender of a Condemnation Withholding Event (but not later than
thirty (30) days after the Condemnation), Lender shall provide written notice
thereof to Tenant.

  



  

15.03 **_No Abatement of Rent_**. Except as otherwise provided in _Section
15.01_, this Lease shall not terminate, be forfeited or be affected in any
manner, nor shall there be any reduction or abatement of the Rent payable
hereunder, by reason of any Condemnation of any Property Location or any part
thereof, or by reason of the untenantability of the same or any part thereof,
for or due to any reason or cause whatsoever.

  



  

15.04 **_Tenant s Claim for Reimbursement_**. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Article 15_, to the extent permitted by law, (a)
Tenant shall be allowed, at its sole cost and expense, to pursue a claim
against the condemning authority that shall be independent of and wholly
separate from any action, suit or proceeding relating to any award to
Landlord for reimbursement of Tenants leasehold interest, relocation
expenses or for Tenants Personalty; and (b) Tenant and any Tenant Mortgagee
shall have the right to participate, at their sole cost and expense, in any
Condemnation proceeding affecting a Property Location or any
Buildings thereon; provided that such claim, award or participation does not
adversely affect or interfere with the prosecution of Landlords claim for
the Condemnation or otherwise reduce the amount recoverable by Landlord for
the Condemnation.

  



        
   

  



  

 **ARTICLE 16.

(c) Failure by Tenant to observe or to perform any other material covenant,
agreement, condition or provision of this Lease, if such failure continues
for thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from Landlord to Tenant or

of the default (provided Tenant shall have undertaken procedures to cure the
default within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently pursue
such effort to completion) provided, however, that the foregoing notice
obligation and cure period shall not be applicable where Tenants failure to
observe or to perform any other material covenant agreement, condition or
provision of this Lease relates to (i) Tenants payment of Rent or any other
monetary obligation hereunder, or (ii) a condition that would place the
Premises in immediate physical jeopardy or in immediate jeopardy of being
forfeited or lost.

  



  

(d) Intentionally deleted;

and void and no longer a potential Default under this Lease;

  



  

(k) A default under or a breach of the terms and provisions of any Overlease
with respect to the tenant thereunder (after expiration of all applicable
cure periods) caused by Tenant; or

  



  

(l) The failure by Tenant to observe or to perform any obligation set forth
in _Section 31.17_ after the expiration of any applicable cure periods set
forth in such Section.

  



  

16.02 **_Rights and Remedies of Landlord_**. If a Default occurs, Landlord
shall have the rights and remedies hereinafter set forth, which shall be
distinct, separate and cumulative and which shall not operate to exclude or
deprive Landlord of any other right or remedy allowed it by law or equity:

  



  

(a) Landlord, upon ten (10) days additional prior notice to Tenant (during
which time Tenant may cure the Default) with respect to any Default set forth
in _Sections 16.01(b) through (k)_ (expressly excluding _Sections 16.01(a)
and (l)_ for which no additional notice shall be required), may terminate
this Lease with respect to each and every Property Location by giving to
Tenant notice of Landlords election to do so, in which event the Term shall
end, and all rights, title and interest of Tenant hereunder shall expire, on
the date stated in such notice; provided, however, that Landlord shall only
be obligated to provide such additional written notice and the ten (10) day
cure period shall be available only twice every twelve (12) months;

  



  

(b) Landlord, upon ten (10) days additional prior notice to Tenant (during
which time Tenant may cure the Default) with respect to any Default set forth
in

  



        
   

  



  

 _Sections 16.01(b) through (k)_ (expressly excluding _Sections 16.01(a)
and (l)_ for which no additional notice shall be required), may terminate the
right of Tenant to possession with respect to each and every
Property Location without terminating this Lease by giving notice to Tenant
that Tenants right of possession shall end on the date stated in such
notice, whereupon the right of Tenant to possession of the applicable
Property Location or any part thereof shall cease on the date stated in such
notice; provided, however that Landlord shall only be obligated to provide
such additional written notice and the ten (10) day cure period shall be
available only twice every twelve (12) months;

  



  

(c) Landlord may, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law and subject

pertaining to the general use and operation of the Premises, but excluding
any permits or other rights and privileges that are specific to the use and
operation of Tenants business upon the Premises, and (ii) expel Tenant and
those claiming under or through Tenant, without being deemed guilty in any
manner of trespass or becoming liable for any loss or damage resulting
therefrom, without resort to legal or judicial process, procedure or action.
No notice from Landlord hereunder or under a forcible entry and detainer
statute or similar law shall constitute an election by Landlord to terminate
this Lease unless such notice specifically so states. If Tenant shall, after
default, voluntarily give up possession of the Premises to Landlord, deliver
to Landlord or its agents the keys to the Premises, or both, such actions
shall be deemed to be in compliance with Landlords rights and the acceptance
thereof by Landlord or its agents shall not be deemed to constitute a
termination of this Lease. Landlord reserves the right following any re-entry
and/or reletting to exercise its right to terminate this Lease by giving
Tenant written notice thereof, in which event this Lease will terminate;

  



  

(d) Except for a Default pursuant to _Section 16.01(l)_, Landlord may bring
an action against Tenant for any damages sustained by Landlord or any
equitable relief available to Landlord in connection with enforcing its
rights under this _Article 16_;

  



  

(e) Landlord may relet the Premises or any part thereof for such term or
terms (including a term which extends beyond the original Lease Term), at
such rentals and upon such other terms as Landlord, in its reasonable
discretion, may determine, with all proceeds received from such reletting
being applied to the Rent due from Tenant in such order as Landlord may, in
it sole discretion, determine, which may include, without limitation, all
repossession costs, brokerage commissions, attorneys fees and expenses,
alteration, remodeling and repair costs and expenses of preparing for such
reletting, all of which costs shall be reasonable and customary. Landlord
reserves the right following any re-entry and/or reletting to exercise its
right to terminate this Lease by giving Tenant written notice thereof, in
which event this Lease will terminate as specified in said notice.
Landlord agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any
damages resulting from a Default of Tenant; provided, however, that
Landlords obligation to so mitigate shall be satisfied in full and deemed
reasonable if Landlord undertakes to lease each Property Location to another
tenant (a "Replacement Tenant") in accordance with the following criteria:

  



  

(i) Landlord shall not be obligated to lease a Property Location to a
Replacement Tenant under terms or conditions that are unacceptable to
Landlord under

  



        
   

  



  

Landlords then current leasing policies for comparable space in the same
market area as the applicable Property Location, if any;

  



  

(ii) Landlord shall not be obligated to enter into a lease with any proposed
Replacement Tenant which does not have, in Landlords reasonable opinion,
sufficient financial resources or operating experience to operate the
Premises; and

  



  

(iii) Landlord shall not be required to expend any amount of money to alter,
remodel or otherwise make the Premises suitable for use by a proposed
substitute Tenant unless: (1) Tenant pays any such sum to Landlord in advance
of Landlords execution of a substitute lease with such tenant (which payment
shall not be in lieu of Rent or any damages or other sums to which Landlord
may be entitled as a result of Tenants Default under this Lease); and (2)
Landlord, in Landlords sole discretion, determines that any such expenditure
is financially justified in connection with entering into any such substitute
lease.

  



  

(f) Except for a Default pursuant to _Section 16.01(l)_, Landlord may
recover from Tenant all reasonable actual out-of-pocket costs and expenses
paid or incurred by Landlord as a result of such Default, regardless of
whether or not legal proceedings are actually commenced;

  



  

(g) Except for a Default pursuant to _Section 16.01(l)_, Landlord may
immediately or at any time thereafter, upon written notice to Tenant (except
in the event of an emergency, in which event no notice shall be necessary),
at Landlords sole option but without any obligation to do so, correct such
Default and charge Tenant all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by
Landlord therein. Any sum or sums so paid by Landlord, together with interest
at the rate provided in _Section 31.07_, shall be deemed to be Rent
hereunder and shall be immediately due from Tenant to Landlord. Any such acts
by Landlord in correcting Tenants Defaults hereunder shall not be deemed to
cure said Defaults or constitute any waiver of Landlords right to exercise
any or all remedies set forth herein;

  



  

(h) Landlord may immediately or at any time thereafter, and with or without
notice, except as required herein, set off any money of Tenant held by
Landlord under this Lease or Other Lease against any sum owing by Tenant
hereunder or owed under the Other Lease; provided that, subject to a Lenders
right to credit the balance of any reserves held by the Lender against future
payments on the applicable debt, any Impositions Reserve or Insurance Reserve
(as such terms are defined in _Section 30.01_) held by Landlord shall be
applied and disbursed in accordance with _Article 30_; and/or

  



  

(i) Landlord may seek any equitable relief available to Landlord, including,
without limitation, the right of specific performance.

  



  

16.03 **_Final Damages_**. If this Lease is terminated by Landlord as
provided in _Section 16.02(a)_, in addition to Landlords rights set forth
in Section 16.02, Landlord shall be entitled to recover from Tenant all Rent
accrued and unpaid for the period up to and including such termination date,
as well as all other additional sums payable by Tenant, or for which Tenant
is liable or in respect of which Tenant has agreed to indemnify Landlord
under any of the provisions of this Lease, which may be then owing and
unpaid, and all costs and expenses,

  



        
   

  



  

including court costs and reasonable attorneys fees incurred by Landlord in
the enforcement of its rights and remedies hereunder.

  



  

16.04 **_Removal of Personal Property_**. All of Tenants Personalty removed
from any Property Location by Landlord pursuant to any provisions of this
Lease or any Laws may be handled, removed or stored by Landlord at the sole
cost and expense of Tenant, and Landlord, in no event, shall be responsible
for the value, preservation or safekeeping thereof. Tenant shall pay Landlord
for all expenses incurred by Landlord in such removal and storage charges
against such property as long as the same is in Landlords possession or
under Landlords control. _Subject to Section 31.13_, all of Tenants
Personalty not removed from any Property Location or retaken from storage by
Tenant within twenty (20) days after the end of the Term, however terminated,
at Landlords option, shall be conclusively deemed to have been conveyed by
Tenant to Landlord as by bill of sale without further payment or credit by
Landlord to Tenant.

  



  

16.05 **_Landlord s Default_**. If Landlord shall violate, neglect or fail
to perform or observe any of the representations, covenants, provisions, or
conditions contained in this Lease on its part to be performed or observed,
which default continues for a period of more than thirty (30) days after
receipt of written notice from Tenant specifying such default, or if such
default is of a nature to require more than thirty (30) days for remedy and
continues beyond the time reasonably necessary to cure (provided Landlord
must have undertaken procedures to cure the default within such thirty (30)
day period and thereafter diligently pursues such efforts to cure to
completion), Tenant, at its option (in addition to all other rights and
remedies provided Tenant at law, in equity or hereunder), upon further
written notice to Landlord of Tenants intention to exercise any remedy
hereunder, which shall provide Landlord with an additional ten (10) days cure
period thereafter, may either terminate this Lease upon written notice
thereof given to Landlord, or incur any reasonable expense necessary to
perform the obligation of Landlord specified in such notice and bill Landlord
for the costs thereof. If Landlord fails to reimburse Tenant for such
reasonable costs within thirty (30) days after Landlords receipt of such
bill, Tenant may deduct such costs from the next due installments of Monthly
Base Rent, until such costs are recouped by Tenant.

  



  

16.06 **_Attorneys  Fees_**. The defaulting party shall pay all of the non-
defaulting partys costs, charges and expenses, including court costs and
reasonable attorneys fees, incurred in enforcing the defaulting partys
obligations under this Lease, incurred by the non-defaulting party in any
action brought by a party in which the other party is the prevailing party,
or incurred by a prevailing party in any litigation, negotiation or
transaction in which the other party causes such prevailing party, without
such prevailing partys fault, to become involved or concerned.

  



  

16.07 **_Tenant Waiver_**. Tenant hereby expressly waives, for itself and
all Persons claiming by, through and under Tenant, including creditors of
all kinds, (a) any right and privilege which Tenant has under any present
or future Legal Requirements to redeem the Premises, or any part thereof,
or to have a continuance of this Lease for the Term after termination of
Tenants right of occupancy by order or judgment of any court or by any legal
process or writ, or under the terms of this Lease; (b) the benefits of any
present or future Legal Requirements that exempt property from liability for
debt or for distress for rent; (c) any present or future Legal Requirements
relating to notice or delay in levy of execution in case of eviction

  



        
   

  



  

of a tenant for nonpayment of rent; and (d) any benefits and lien rights
which may arise pursuant to any present or future Legal Requirements.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 17. 
 SUBORDINATION; LEASEHOLD MORTGAGE**

  

 ** **

  

17.01 **_Subordination_**. Landlord has executed and delivered and may
execute and deliver hereafter from time to time a mortgage or trust deed in
the nature of a mortgage, both being hereinafter referred to as a "
_Mortgage_ ," against any Parcel and improvements thereon or any interest
therein. Landlord also may, subject to the approval of any Mortgagee (defined
below) (which approval Mortgagee, in its sole discretion, may
withhold), hereafter sell and lease back any Property Location, or any part
thereof, such lease of the underlying land herein called a " _Ground Lease_
", and the landlord under any such lease is herein called a " _Ground
Landlord_ ". If requested by the mortgagee or trustee under any Mortgage
(both being hereinafter referred to as a " _Mortgagee_ ") or by any Ground
Landlord, Tenant will either (a) subordinate its interest in this Lease to
said Mortgage or said Ground Lease, as the case may be, and to any and
all advances made thereunder and to the interest thereon, and to all
renewals, replacements, supplements, amendments, modifications and extensions
thereof, or (b) make certain of Tenants rights and interests in this Lease
superior thereto; and Tenant will execute and deliver such agreement or
agreements promptly, as may be reasonably approved by Tenant, Landlord or
such Mortgagee, or such Ground Landlord, as the case may be. Any Mortgage
to which this Lease is now or hereafter subordinate shall provide, in effect,
that during the time this Lease is in force all insurance proceeds and
condemnation awards shall be permitted to be used for restoration in
accordance with the provisions of this Lease. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, as a condition to subordinating its rights and interests
under this Lease to any such Mortgagee or such Ground Landlord, as the case
may be, so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing, Tenants rights
and interests under this Lease shall remain enforceable and undisturbed and
Mortgagee or such Ground Landlord, as the case may be, shall enter into a
subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement with Tenant, which
agreement shall be substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_,
or in such other form as may be reasonably approved by Tenant,
Landlord, such Mortgagee or such Ground Landlord.

  



  

17.02 **_Liability of Mortgagee; Attornment_**. It is further agreed that (a)
if any Mortgage shall be foreclosed, or if any Ground Lease shall be
terminated, (i) the Mortgagee (or its grantees) or purchaser at any
foreclosure sale (or grantee in a deed in lieu of foreclosure), or Ground
Landlord, as the case may be, or their respective successors and assigns
shall not be (1) liable for any act or omission of any prior landlord
(including Landlord), subject to any defenses, offsets or counterclaims which
Tenant may have against a prior landlord (including Landlord) as long as the
same are not continuing, (2) bound by any obligation to perform any work or
to make improvements to the applicable Property Location, or any portion
thereof, or (3) bound by any prepayment of Base Rent or other Rent which
Tenant may have made in excess of the amounts then due for the next
succeeding month (other than any reserves paid under this Lease), (ii) the
liability of the Mortgagee hereunder or purchaser at such foreclosure sale or
the liability of a subsequent owner designated as Landlord under this Lease
shall exist only so long as such Mortgagee, Ground Landlord, purchaser or
owner, as applicable, is the owner of the applicable Building or Parcel and
such liability shall not continue or survive after further transfer of
ownership; and (iii) upon request of the Mortgagee if the Mortgage is
foreclosed, or of the

  



        
   

  



  

Ground Landlord if the Ground Lease is terminated, and provided that Tenants
rights and interests under this Lease shall remain enforceable and
undisturbed, Tenant will attorn, as Tenant under this Lease, to the purchaser
at any foreclosure sale under any Mortgage, and Tenant will attorn as the
tenant under this Lease to the Ground Landlord, and Tenant will execute such
instruments as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to evidence such
attornment; and (b) this Lease may not be modified or amended so as to reduce
Rent or shorten the Term provided hereunder, or so as to affect adversely in
any other respect or to any material extent the rights of Landlord, and this
Lease shall not be cancelled or surrendered, without the prior written
consent, in each instance, of the Mortgagee or of the Ground Landlord, as the
case may be, other than as expressly permitted pursuant to the terms of this
Lease.

  



  

17.03 **_Tenant Leasehold Mortgage_**.

  



  

(a) Provided that, at the time Tenant proposes to grant any Leasehold
Mortgage (as hereinafter defined in  _Section 17.03(c)(i))_, no Default
exists, Tenant shall have the right to grant a Leasehold Mortgage on Tenants
leasehold interest in the Premises with respect to all but not less than all
of the entire Premises. Any Tenants Mortgagee (as hereinafter defined in
_Section 31.13_) or permitted Leasehold Mortgagee (as hereinafter defined in
_Section 17.03(c)(ii)_) shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of
any subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement granted to Tenant
hereunder, but (i) any such Leasehold Mortgage otherwise shall be in all
respect subject and subordinate to Landlords interest in this Lease and to
any Mortgage or Ground Lease granted by Landlord, and to any renewals,
modifications, consolidations, replacements and extensions of any such
Mortgage or Ground Lease, whether such Mortgage or Ground Lease, or any
renewal, modification, consolidation, replacement or extension thereof, is
granted by Landlord prior or subsequent to any Leasehold Mortgage granted by
Tenant; and (ii) the Leasehold Mortgage shall attach to and be a lien on
Tenants leasehold interest in the Premises only, shall convey no interest or
rights in and to Landlords interest in the Lease or the Premises which are
greater than Tenants interest or rights in the Lease or the Premises, and
shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Landlord and
Tenant.

  



  

(b) If Tenant shall grant a Leasehold Mortgage in compliance with the
provisions of this _Section 17.03_, and if Tenant or the Leasehold Mortgagee
shall, within thirty (30) days after the execution of such Leasehold
Mortgage, send to Landlord a true copy thereof, together with written notice
specifying the name and address of the Leasehold Mortgagee thereunder and the
pertinent recording data with respect to such Leasehold Mortgage, then, so
long as such Leasehold Mortgage shall remain unsatisfied of record, the
following provisions shall apply:

  



  

(i) Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give the Leasehold
Mortgagee, at the address for the Leasehold Mortgagee given to Landlord as
provided about, a copy of any notice of default hereunder that relates to the
portions of the Premises applicable to the Leasehold Mortgage at the
approximate time and in a similar manner of giving such notice or
communication to Tenant; _provided, however,_ that the failure to deliver
such notice shall not constitute a default by Landlord hereunder. Landlord
will not exercise any right, power or remedy with respect to any Default
hereunder that relates to the portions of the Premises applicable to the
Leasehold Mortgage, and no notice to Tenant of any such Default

  



        
   

  



  

shall be effective, until Landlord shall have so given to the Leasehold
Mortgagee written notice or a copy of its notice to Tenant of such Default.
Landlord acknowledges that the Leasehold Mortgagee shall have the right to
approve any amendment that changes the permitted use, term, rent or any other
payment obligation set forth herein, or that otherwise materially increases
Tenants obligations or decreases Tenants rights under this Lease.

  



  

(ii) Any Leasehold Mortgagee, in case Tenant shall be in default hereunder,
shall, within the period herein provided, have the right to remedy such
default, or cause the same to be remedied, and Landlord shall accept such
performance by or at the instance of such Leasehold Mortgagee as if the same
had been made by Tenant, provided such remedy has been performed in the time
frame and in the same manner as permitted by Tenant under this Lease. If a
receiver cures any default, Landlord shall accept such cure as though
performed by the Leasehold Mortgagee.

  



  

(iii) It is understood and agreed that any Leasehold Mortgagee, or its
designee, or any purchaser in foreclosure proceedings, any grantee pursuant
to an assignment in lieu of foreclosure, or any other party taking by,
through or under a Leasehold Mortgage or its designee, may become the legal
Tenant under this Lease with respect to the entire Premises through
foreclosure proceedings, by assignment of this Lease in lieu of foreclosure
or otherwise; _provided, however,_ that any such designee, purchaser
in foreclosure, grantee pursuant to an assignment in lieu of foreclosure or
other party shall, in all events, take subject to the terms of this Lease.

  



  

(iv) Upon any rejection of this Lease by any trustee of the Tenant in any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement or similar proceeding which would, if
it were not for this _Article 17_, cause this Lease to terminate, without
any action or consent by Landlord, Tenant or any Leasehold Mortgagee, the
transfer of Tenants interest hereunder to such Leasehold Mortgagee shall
automatically occur. Such Leasehold Mortgagee may terminate this Lease upon
any such transfer by giving notice thereof to Landlord no later than thirty
(30) days after notice of such transfer. Upon any such termination, such
Leasehold Mortgagee shall have no further obligations hereunder, including
any obligations which may have accrued prior to such termination, except for
any obligations previously undertaken by the Leasehold Mortgagee pursuant to
_Section 17.03(b)(iii)_ or caused by Leasehold Mortgagees acts while in
physical possession of the Premises or by a court appointed receiver acting
as agent for Leasehold Mortgagee.

  



  

(v) Landlord agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to give the
Leasehold Mortgagee notice of any condemnation proceedings affecting the
applicable Property Location (the failure of which shall not constitute a
default by Landlord hereunder), and such Leasehold Mortgagee shall have the
right to intervene and be made a party to any such condemnation proceedings
to the extent of Tenants right to do so under this Lease.

  



  

(vi) If a Leasehold Mortgagee shall acquire title to Tenants interest in the
Premises, by foreclosure of a Leasehold Mortgage thereon, by assignment in
lieu of foreclosure, by an assignment for a nominee or wholly-owned
subsidiary of such Leasehold Mortgagee, or otherwise, such Leasehold
Mortgagee may assign this Lease or sublet or underlet the Premises only in
compliance with _Article 12_. Upon any assignment made in compliance

  



        
   

  



  

with _Article 12_ of this Lease in favor of any owner of the leasehold
estate pursuant to this Lease whose interest shall have been acquired by,
through or under any Leasehold Mortgagee or from any other holder thereof,
the assignor shall be relieved of any further liability which may accrue
under this Lease from and after the date of such assignment, provided that
the assignee shall execute and deliver to Landlord a recordable instrument of
assumption wherein such assignee shall assume and agree to perform and
observe the covenants and conditions in this Lease contained on Tenants part
to be performed and observed, it being the intention that once the Leasehold
Mortgagee shall succeed to Tenants interest under this Lease, any and all
subsequent assignments (whether by such Leasehold Mortgagee, any purchaser at
a foreclosure sale or any other transferee or assignee) shall, subject to
the provisions of _Article 12_, effect a release of the
assignors liability under this Lease from and after such assignment.

  



  

(vii) There shall be no merger of this Lease nor of the leasehold estate
created by this Lease with the fee estate in the Premises or any part thereof
by reason of the fact that the same person, firm, corporation or other entity
may acquire or own or hold, directly or indirectly, (1) this Lease or the
leasehold estate created by this Lease or any interest in this Lease or in
any such leasehold estate, and (2) the fee estate in the Premises or any part
thereof or any interest in such fee estate, and no such merger shall occur
unless and until all corporations, firms and other entities, including any
Leasehold Mortgagee, having any interest in (A) this Lease or the leasehold
estate created by this Lease and (B) the fee estate in the Premises or any
part thereof or any interest in such fee estate shall join in a written
instrument effecting such merger and shall duly record the same.

  



  

(viii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the provisions of
this _Article 17_ shall inure only to the benefit of the Leasehold Mortgage
which is a first lien on Tenants interest in the Premises. Landlord shall,
upon request, execute, acknowledge and deliver to such Leasehold Mortgagee
after its request an agreement prepared at the sole cost and expense of
Tenant, in form reasonably satisfactory to such Leasehold Mortgagee and
Landlord, among Landlord, Tenant and such Leasehold Mortgagee, agreeing to
all of the provisions of this _Section 17.03_.

  



  

(c) _Definition of Terms_.

  



  

(i) For purposes of this Lease, " _Leasehold Mortgage_ " shall mean a
mortgage upon Tenants leasehold estate and other rights of Tenant created
pursuant to this Lease, and Tenants rights under any subleases.

  



  

(ii) For purposes of this Lease, " _Leasehold Mortgagee_ " shall mean any
mortgagee, trustee, or secured party under a Leasehold Mortgage. The
Leasehold Mortgagee shall be an insurance company, savings bank, commercial
bank (acting as a trustee, agent or otherwise), or other institutional
lending source having a capital and surplus or net assets of at least Two
Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($250,000,000).

  



         
  

  



  

 **ARTICLE 18. 
 MORTGAGEE PROTECTION**

  

 ** **

  

Tenant agrees to give the Mortgagee or Ground Landlord, as the case may be,
by overnight courier service or by registered or certified mail, a copy of
any notice or claim of default served upon Landlord by Tenant, provided that
prior to such notice, Tenant has been notified in writing, by way of service
on Tenant of a copy of an assignment of Landlords interests in leases, or
otherwise, of the address of such Mortgagee or Ground Landlord, as the case
may be. Tenant further agrees that such Mortgagee or Ground Landlord, as the
case may be, shall have the right to cure such default within the time period
provided for hereunder for Landlord to cure any Landlord Default.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 19. 
 ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE**

  

 ** **

  

Tenant and Landlord agree, from time to time and upon not less than ten (10)
days prior request by either of them to the other, to deliver to the
requesting party a statement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_
certifying to any mortgagee, purchaser or assignee, as the case may be, of
such party (or proposed mortgagee, purchaser or assignee, as the case may be,
of such partys interest) (a) that this Lease is unmodified and in full force
and effect (or if there have been modifications, that this Lease,
as modified, is in full force and effect and identifying the
modifications); (b) the date upon which Tenant began paying Rent and the
dates to which Rent and other charges have been paid; (c) that the requesting
party is not in default under any provision of this Lease, or, if in default,
the nature thereof in detail; (d) that the Tenant is in occupancy of each
Property Location and paying Rent on a current basis with no rental offsets
or claims; (e) that there has been no prepayment of Rent other than that
provided for in this Lease; (f) that there are no actions, whether voluntary
or otherwise, pending against the other party under the bankruptcy laws of
the United States or any State thereof; and (g) such other matters as may
be reasonably requested to the knowledge of the party providing the estoppel.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 20. 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF TENANT**

  

 ** **

  

The representations and warranties of Tenant contained in this _Article 20_
are being made as of the Effective Date to induce Landlord to enter into this
Lease and Landlord has relied upon such representations and warranties.
Tenant represents and warrants to Landlord as of the Effective Date as
follows:

  



  

20.01 **_Organization, Authority and Status of Tenant_**. Tenant has been
duly organized or formed, is validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its state of formation and is qualified as a limited liability
company to do business in any jurisdiction where such qualification is
required except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. All necessary company action has been taken to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance by Tenant of this Lease and
of the other documents, instruments and agreements provided for herein.
Tenant is not a "foreign limited liability company," "foreign corporation,"
"foreign partnership," "foreign trust" or "foreign estate," as

  



        
   

  



  

those terms are defined in the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder. The individual who has executed this Lease on behalf of Tenant is
duly authorized to do so.

  



  

20.02 **_Enforceability_**. Assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery hereof by Landlord, this Lease constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of Tenant, enforceable against Tenant in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
creditors rights generally and the availability of injunctive relief and
other equitable remedies.

  



  

20.03 **_Property Condition_**. Tenant has physically inspected all of the
Premises and has examined title to the Premises, and has found all of the
same satisfactory in all respects for all of Tenants purposes.

  



  

20.04 **_Litigation_**. There are no suits, actions, proceedings or
investigations pending, or to the best of its knowledge, threatened against
or involving Tenant or the Premises before any arbitrator or governmental
authority which could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect in the operations of Tenant or the Premises.

  



  

20.05 **_Compliance With OFAC Laws_**. Neither Tenant nor any direct member
of Tenant is an individual or entity whose property or interests are subject
to being blocked under Executive Order 13224 issued by the President of the
United States and all regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _OFAC Laws_
") or is otherwise in violation of any of the OFAC Laws; _provided, however_
_,_ that the representation contained in this sentence shall not apply to any
individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, trust, or
other form of entity (" _Person_ ") to the extent such Persons interest is
in or through an entity whose securities are listed on a national securities
exchange or quoted on an automated quotation system in the United States or a
wholly-owned subsidiary of such entity.

  



  

20.06 **_Ownership_**. The interests in SKO Group Holdings, LLC, a [Delaware]
limited liability company that indirectly owns all of the shares of Tenant,
are directly owned by the persons identified on the letter from Tenant to
Landlord dated , 2006.

  



  

20.07 **_Absence of Breaches or Defaults_**. Tenant is not in default under
any document, instrument or agreement to which Tenant is a party or by which
Tenant or the Premises is subject or bound, which has had, or could
reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect against Tenant
or the Premises. The authorization, execution, delivery and performance of
this Lease and the documents, instruments and agreements provided for herein
will not result in any breach of or default under any document, instrument or
agreement to which Tenant is a party or by which Tenant or the Premises is
subject or bound, which has had, or could reasonably be expected to result
in, a Material Adverse Effect against Tenant or the Premises.

  



  

20.08 **_Solvency_**. There is no contemplated, pending or threatened
Insolvency Event or similar proceedings, whether voluntary or involuntary,
against Tenant. The term " _Insolvency Event_ " shall mean (a) a failure to
generally pay debts as such debts become due, admitting in writing an
inability to pay debts generally or making a general assignment for the
benefit of creditors; (b) any proceeding being instituted by or against
Tenant (i) seeking to adjudicate it

  



        
   

  



  

bankrupt or insolvent; (ii) seeking liquidation, winding up, reorganization,
arrangement, adjustment, protection, relief, or composition of it or its
debts under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization or
relief of debtors; or (iii) seeking the entry of an order for relief or the
appointment of a receiver, trustee, or other similar official for it or for
any substantial part of its property, and in the case of any such proceeding
instituted against, either such proceeding shall remain undismissed for a
period of one hundred twenty (120) days or any of the actions sought in such
proceeding shall occur; or (c) the taking of any corporate or company action
to authorize any of the actions set forth above in this definition.

  



  

20.09 **_Licenses and Permits_**. Tenant has obtained or has the use of all
required licenses and permits, both governmental and private, to use and
operate the Premises as currently used except where the failure to have such
licenses and permits would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 21. 
 NONWAIVER**

  

 ** **

  

No waiver of any condition expressed in this Lease shall be implied by any
neglect of Landlord to enforce any remedy on account of the violation of such
condition whether or not such violation is continued or repeated
subsequently, and no express waiver shall affect any condition other than the
one specified in such waiver and that one only for the time and in the manner
specifically stated. Without limiting any of Landlords rights under this
Lease, it is agreed that no receipt of monies by Landlord from Tenant after
the expiration or early termination in any way of the Term or of
Tenants right of possession hereunder or after the giving of any notice
shall reinstate, continue or extend the Term or affect any notice given to
Tenant prior to the receipt of such monies. It is also agreed that after the
service of notice or the commencement of a suit or after final judgment for
possession of the Premises, Landlord may receive and collect any monies due,
and the payment of said monies shall not waive or affect said notice, suit or
judgment.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 22. 
 CORPORATION OR PARTNERSHIP OR LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY**

  

 ** **

  

In case Tenant or Landlord is a corporation, such party represents and

Location or any Person is in imminent danger of harm, in which case notice
that is feasible under the circumstances shall be given to Tenant), Landlord
shall have the right (but not the obligation) to take such action as is
required to be taken by Tenant hereunder and in such event, Tenant shall be
liable and responsible to Landlord for all costs, expenses, liabilities,
claims and other obligations paid, suffered, or incurred by Landlord in
connection with such matters. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord immediately

Landlord for which Landlord is entitled to indemnity hereunder, Landlord
shall notify Tenant of such Claim or assertion of liability and thereupon
Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, assume the defense of such Claim
or assertion of liability (with counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord)
and continue such defense at all times thereafter until completion. The
obligations of Tenant under this _Article 25_ shall survive for a period of
five (5) years from the termination or expiration of this Lease.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 26. 
 TITLE AND COVENANT AGAINST LIENS**

  

 ** **

  

26.01 Landlords title is and always shall be paramount to the title of
Tenant and nothing contained in this Lease shall empower Tenant to do any act
which can, shall or may encumber the title of Landlord. Tenant covenants and
agrees not to suffer or permit any lien of mechanics or materialmen to be
placed upon or against the Premises, the Buildings or the Parcels and, in
case of any such lien attaching, to pay and remove or insure over same
promptly. Tenant has no authority or power to cause or permit any lien or
encumbrance of any kind whatsoever, whether created by act of Tenant,
operation of law or otherwise, to attach to or to be placed upon the
Premises, the Buildings or the Parcels, and any and all liens
and encumbrances created by Tenant shall attach only to Tenants interest in
the Premises. If any such liens so attach and Tenant fails to pay and remove
or bond the same within thirty (30) days, Landlord, at its election, may pay
and satisfy the same, and in such event, the sums so paid by Landlord,
with interest from the date of payment at the Default Interest rate shall be
deemed to be Rent due and payable by Tenant at once without notice or demand.
Except as permitted pursuant to _Section 9.04_ and _Article 17_ of
this Lease, Landlord covenants and agrees not to suffer or permit any
covenants,

  



        
   

  



  

restrictions, reservations, encumbrances, liens, conditions, encroachments,
easements and other matters of title that would affect one or more of the
Property Locations without Tenants prior written consent.

  



  

Landlord hereby grants a limited power of attorney to Tenant to acknowledge,
deliver and execute on Landlords behalf any proposed agreement affecting the
Property Location(s) if such agreement is in the nature of an easement and
(i) is specifically stated to encumber the Property Location(s) only while
Tenant is in possession of the Property Location(s) or (ii) shall, by the
terms of the agreement, end with the termination of this Lease. Upon the
execution of any such agreement, Tenant shall deliver, within twenty (20)
days thereof, a copy of such agreement to Landlord.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 27. 
 EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS**

  

 ** **

  

It is understood and agreed expressly by and between the parties hereto,
anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, that each and all of the
representations, warranties, covenants, undertakings and agreements made
herein on the part of Landlord, while in form purporting to be the
representations, warranties, covenants, undertakings and agreements
of Landlord, are nevertheless each and every one of them made and intended,
not as personal representations, warranties, covenants, undertakings and
agreements by Landlord or for the purpose or with the intention of binding
Landlord personally, but are made and intended for the purpose only of
subjecting Landlords interest in each Property Location to the terms of this
Lease and for no other purpose whatsoever, and in case of default hereunder
by Landlord, Tenant shall look solely to the interests of Landlord in each
Property Location; that Landlord shall have no personal liability to pay
any indebtedness accruing hereunder or to perform any covenant, either
express or implied, contained herein; and that no personal liability or
personal responsibility of any sort is assumed by, nor at any time shall be
asserted or enforceable against, said Landlord, individually.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 28. 
 QUIET USE AND ENJOYMENT**

  

 ** **

  

If and as long as Tenant shall faithfully perform the agreements, terms,
covenants and conditions hereof, Tenant shall and may (subject, however, to
the provisions, reservations, terms and conditions of this Lease, including
without limitation, _Sections 17.01 and 17.02_ ) peaceably and quietly have,
hold and enjoy the Premises for the Term hereby granted, including
extensions, without molestation or disturbance by or from Landlord or any
Person or entity claiming through or under Landlord and free of any
encumbrance created or suffered by Landlord, except from
encumbrances created, suffered or consented to by Tenant. This covenant shall
be construed as running with the land to and against subsequent owners and
successors in interest and is not, nor shall it operate or be construed as, a
personal covenant of Landlord, except to the extent of Landlords interest in
the Premises and only so long as such interest shall continue, and thereafter
this covenant shall be binding upon such subsequent owners and successors
in interest of Landlords interest under this Lease, to the extent of
their respective interests, as and when they shall acquire the same, and only
so long as they shall retain such interest.

  



        
   

  



  

 **ARTICLE 29. 
 CHARACTERIZATION OF LEASE**

  

 ** **

  

The following expressions of intent, representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements, stipulations and waivers are a material inducement to Landlord
and Tenant entering into this lease:

  



  

29.01 **_Unseverable Lease_**. Landlord and Tenant intend that (a) this Lease
constitutes an unseverable and single lease of all, but not less than all, of
the Property Locations, and, if at any time this Lease covers other real
property in addition to the Property Locations, neither this Lease, nor
Landlords obligations or rights hereunder may be allocated or otherwise
divided among such properties by Tenant; (b) **[Form for Pamida Lease][**
except with respect to Store Number 3096 in Ely, Minnesota and Store Number
3223 in Plentywood, Montana, **][Form for ShopKo Lease][** except with
respect to the leasehold position with respect to Store Number 141

state income tax purposes, is not a financing lease, capital lease, mortgage,
equitable mortgage, deed of trust, trust agreement, security agreement or
other financing or trust arrangement, and the economic realities of this
Lease are those of a true lease; and (c) the business relationship created by
this Lease and any related documents is solely that of a long-term commercial
lease between Landlord and Tenant, the Lease has been entered into by both
parties in reliance upon the economic and legal bargains contained herein,
and none of the agreements contained herein is intended, nor shall the same
be deemed or construed, to create a partnership ( _de factor_ or _de jure_
) between Landlord and Tenant, to make them joint venturers, to make Tenant
an agent, legal representative, partner, subsidiary or employee of Landlord,
nor to make Landlord in any way responsible for the debts, obligations or
losses of Tenant.

  



  

29.02 **_Waiver_**. Tenant and Landlord each waive any claim or defense based
upon the characterization of this Lease as anything other than as a true
lease and a master lease of all of the Property Locations. Tenant and
Landlord each stipulate and agree (a) not to challenge the validity,
enforceability or characterization of the lease of the Property Locations as
a single, unseverable instrument pertaining to the lease of all, but not less
than all, of the Property Locations, (b) except as may be required by Laws or
a governmental authority (it being understood that Tenant and Landlord each
agree that, except as indicated in _Section 29.01(b)_ , under current U.S.
federal income tax law, this Lease is a "true lease"), not to assert or take,
or omit to take, any action if such omission would be inconsistent with the
agreements and understandings set forth in this _Article 29_ , and (c) that,
in the event that its separate existence from another person is disregarded
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it shall not permit such person to
assert or take and action, or omit to take any action if such omission would
be, inconsistent with the agreements and understandings set forth in this
_Article 29_  (determined as though such person had been a party hereto).

  



  

 **ARTICLE 30.

 ** **

  

30.01 **_Reserves_**. Upon (a) the occurrence of a Reserve Event (as

premiums for insurance required under _Article 6_  (the " _Insurance Reserve_
"), fixed and basic rents (the " _Overlease Rents_ ") to be made pursuant to
the Overleases (the " _Overlease Reserve_ ") and/or maintenance expenses ("
_Maintenance Expenses_ ") for the Premises (in an amount equal to $0.20 per
net rentable square foot of the Premises) (the " _Maintenance Reserve_ "; the
Impositions Reserve, the Insurance Reserve, the Overlease Reserve and/or the
Maintenance Reserve are each a " _Reserve_ " and collectively, the "
_Reserves_ ") that Landlord reasonably estimates will be necessary in order
to accumulate with Landlord sufficient funds to pay such Impositions,
insurance premiums, Overlease Rents and Maintenance Expenses as applicable
for the earlier of (i) the ensuing twelve (12) months, or (ii) at least
thirty (30) days prior to their respective due dates. Landlord shall hold or
cause the Mortgagee to hold the amount for each Reserve required hereunder in
an interest-bearing account which interest thereon shall accrue for
the benefit of Tenant (which may be a book entry subaccount) (each, a "
_Reserve Subaccount Account_ ", and collectively, the " _Reserve Subaccounts_
"). Landlord shall have the right to collect Reserves on an annual basis
until the occurrence of a Reserve Reversal Event (defined below).

  



  

30.02 **_Satisfaction of Tenant s Obligations_**. Any Reserve payments
made by Tenant pursuant to _Section 30.01_ for Impositions,
Maintenance Expenses, insurance premiums and Overlease Rents shall satisfy
Tenants obligations to pay Impositions, Maintenance Expenses and Overlease
Rents and to pay for and maintain insurance under this Lease for the
applicable twelve (12) month period. Landlord shall timely pay or cause to be

Reserves available to Tenant to timely pay such Impositions, Overlease Rents
and insurance premiums.

  



  

30.03 **_Reserve Period; Maintenance Expenses_**. During a Reserve Period
(as hereinafter defined), Landlord shall disburse or cause the Mortgagee
to disburse funds held in the Reserve Subaccount for Maintenance Expenses
to Tenant within fifteen (15) days after the delivery by Tenant to Landlord
of a request therefor, in an amount greater than $25,000 (or a lesser amount
if the total amount in the Maintenance Reserve is less than $25,000, in which
case only one such disbursement as to that particular Maintenance Expense
shall be made), provided that the request for disbursement is accompanied by:
(a) a certificate signed by an officer of Tenant: (i) stating that
the maintenance which is the subject of the requested disbursement has
been completed, (ii) identifying each Person that supplied materials or labor
in connection with such maintenance or any portion thereof, and (iii)

receipt of the requested disbursement, will be paid in full with respect to
the portion of the maintenance which is the subject of the requested
disbursement; (b) copies of appropriate lien waivers, to the extent
applicable, or other evidence of payment reasonably satisfactory to Landlord;
and (c) if requested by Landlords Lender, a title search for such Property
Location indicating that such Property Location is free from all liens,
claims and other encumbrances not previously approved by Landlord.

  



  

30.04 **_Reserve Reversal Event_**. Upon a Reserve Reversal Event, no
further Reserves shall be required and any Reserves and/or Letter of Credit
(as hereinafter defined) held by Landlord or Mortgagee shall be
immediately released and/or returned, as the case may be, to Tenant.

  



  

30.05 **_Letter of Credit_**. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this _Article 30_, at Tenants option, in lieu of
the requirements set forth herein with respect to

  



        
   

  



  

Tenants obligation to make deposits into one or more Reserve Subaccounts,
Tenant may deliver a Letter of Credit to Landlord in an amount equal to the
aggregate amount which Tenant would otherwise be required to deposit for
Impositions, insurance premiums, Overlease Rents and/or Maintenance Expenses
over the ensuing twelve (12) month period, whereupon Landlord shall remit or
cause Mortgagee to remit the Reserves then on deposit, if any, in the
applicable Reserve Subaccount to Tenant. In the event that Tenant delivers a
Letter of Credit for Impositions, insurance premiums, the Overlease Rents
and/or Maintenance Expenses, Tenant shall be responsible for the payment of
such item and Landlord shall not be responsible therefor. Tenant shall
provide Landlord with notice of any increases (or decreases) in the aggregate
payments over the ensuing twelve (12) month period for Impositions, insurance
premiums, Maintenance Expenses and/or Overlease Rents, as the case may be,
not less than forty-five (45) days prior to the date any such increase (or
decrease) is first due and payable, and the applicable Letter of Credit shall
be increased (or decreased) by an amount equal to such increased
(or decreased) amount at least thirty (30) days prior to the date such
increase (or decrease) is first due and payable. Landlord shall allow a
reduction in the Letter of Credit relating to the Reserve Subaccount for
Maintenance Expenses upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent for
disbursement set forth in _Section 30.03_ , which reduction shall be in an
amount equal to the amount that would have been disbursed to Tenant had the
Reserve Account for Maintenance Expenses contained cash. Upon any non-payment
of Impositions, insurance premiums, Overlease Rents or Maintenance Expenses,
Tenant agrees that Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
draw on any such Letter of Credit and to apply all or any part thereof to the
payment of the item for which such Letter of Credit was established.

of time to cure such default as is allowed Tenant under this Lease, and (c)
to permit Tenants Mortgagee or other lender to go upon the applicable
Property Location for the purpose of removing Tenants Personalty any time
within ninety (90) days after the effective date of any termination of this
Lease or any repossession of the Premises or any part thereof by Landlord
(with Landlord having given Tenants lender prior written notice of such date

whether or not such items become a part of the realty and agrees, without

City Average for All Urban Consumers, All Items, Not Seasonally Adjusted,
with a based period equaling 100 in 1982  1984, as published by the United
States Department of Labors Bureau of Labor Statistics or any successor

its successor index as published by the same governmental authority which
published the Consumer Price Index shall be substituted and any necessary
reasonable adjustments shall be made by Landlord and Tenant in order to carry
out the intent of this Lease. In the event there is no successor index,
Landlord shall reasonably select an alternative price index that will
constitute a reasonable substitute for the Consumer Price Index. " _CPI
Increase_ " shall mean the percentage change in the CPI for the month which

or, except as set forth in _Section 16.01 and Section 16.02_ , for failure to
perform its obligations under this _Section 31.17_. Landlords sole rights

injury or damage, or any emergency or statutory remedy. This waiver by the
parties hereto of any right either may have to a trial by jury has been
negotiated and is an essential aspect of their bargain. Furthermore, Tenant
and Landlord hereby knowingly, voluntarily and intentionally waive the right
each may have to seek punitive, consequential, special and indirect damages

rated or unrated (any combination of which actions and transactions described
in both clauses (i) and (ii) in this paragraph, whether proposed or
completed, are referred to in this Lease as a " _Securitization_ "). Tenant
shall cooperate fully with Landlord and any Affected Party (defined below)
with respect to all reasonable requests and due diligence procedures and to
use reasonable

  



        
   

  



  

efforts to facilitate such Securitization, including, without limitation, but

31.23 **_No Merger_**. There shall be no merger of this Lease nor of the
leasehold estate created by this Lease with the fee estate in or ownership of

this Lease or the leasehold estate created by this Lease or any interest in
this Lease or in such leasehold estate, and (b) the fee estate or ownership
of any of the Premises or any interest in such fee estate or ownership. No
such merger shall occur unless and until all persons, corporations, firms and
other entities having any interest in (i) this Lease or the leasehold estate
created by this Lease, and (ii) the fee estate in or ownership of the
Premises or any part thereof sought to be merged shall join in a written
instrument effecting such merger and shall duly record the same.

  



  

31.24 **_Fair Market Rent_**. With respect to the determination of the
initial Base Rent for an Extension Period, if the parties are unable to agree
upon an initial Base Rent that, taking into account the length of the
Extension Period and the adjustments to the Base Rent during the Extension
Period anticipated under _Section 2.01_ , results in fair market rent for the
Extension Period (such initial Base Rent, the " **FMV Base Rent** "), then an
independent MAI Appraiser (defined below) selected by agreement of the
parties within ten (10) days of said request shall prepare a determination of
the FMV Base Rent. In making such determination, the appraiser shall consider
rentals received in the general market area in which the Property Location is
located for similar buildings of comparable characteristics, including, but
not limited to, comparable lease terms, age, condition and classification. If
within ten (10) business days after being notified of the results of such
appraisal, Landlord and/or Tenant elects to reject that determination, then
each of the parties shall name an additional independent MAI Appraiser within
ten (10) days after such rejection. In the event the appraisers so named
together with the originally named appraiser are unable to agree on an FMV
Base Rent then the determination shall be the amount agreed upon by the
majority of said appraisers and reported to the parties within ten (10) days
thereafter. In the event the parties are unable to select the appraiser in
the first instance, each shall select one appraiser within ten (10) days
after the period for having agreed, and those two appraisers shall select a
third appraiser (in absence of agreement as to the selection of said third
independent appraiser, such selection shall be made by a mediation process
reasonably agreed upon by the parties or in absence of the same, by a court
of competent jurisdiction). The costs and expenses of such appraisal,
including the fees of the appraiser or appraisers, shall be divided equally
between Tenant and Landlord. The determination of the majority of the
appraisers as to the FMV Base Rent shall be conclusive upon the parties and

  



        
   

  



  

judgment upon the same may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
thereof. For purposes of this _Section 31.24_ , " _MAI Appraisers_ " shall
mean firms or individuals, each of whom shall have not less than ten (10)
years experience in appraising retail commercial real estate, preferably in
areas where a majority of the Property Locations are situated. The
determination of the FMV Base Rent hereunder shall be made on a Property
Location-by-Property Location basis, and the initial Base Rent for such
Extension Period shall reflect the FMV Base Rents as determined hereunder for
the Property Locations with respect to which the related Extension Option was
exercised. For purposes of this Section 31.24, "initial Base Rent" shall mean
the annual Base Rent in effect during the Extension Period until the
first Adjustment Date during such Extension Period.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 32.** 
 OVERLEASES [SHOPKO POOL ONLY]

  

 ** **

  

32.01 **_Overleases_**. This _Article 32_ applies specifically to each
Property Location that is a Leasehold Property, and shall apply, regardless
of the identity of the Overlandlord. Because this Lease is a sublease as to
each of the Leasehold Properties, this _Article 32_ inclusive shall be
applicable only to a Leasehold Property. The following provisions are in
addition to the other provisions of this Lease which apply to all of the
Property Locations, including the Leasehold Properties, and these following
provisions shall not substitute for or replace the other provisions in this
Lease, except to the extent the following provisions conflict with the other
provisions in this Lease, in which case these following provisions shall
govern as to a Leasehold Property:

  



  

(a) No Leasehold Property shall be used or occupied, or permitted or suffered
to be used or occupied, by Landlord or Tenant or any party claiming by or
through Landlord or Tenant for any use, purpose or activity which is not
permitted by the Overlease for such Leasehold Property.

  



  

(b) Tenant, insofar as applicable to the Premises, shall at its sole expense,
(i) comply with the Overleases, and with all applicable Legal Requirements
pursuant to the Overleases, and (ii) notwithstanding the requirements of
Article 6, shall comply pursuant to the Overleases with the requirements of
all policies of insurance of whatsoever nature which are required to be
maintained pursuant to the Overleases.

  



  

(c) Tenant acknowledges that this Lease, and Tenants occupancy of a
Leasehold Property, are subject to and subordinate to the applicable
Overlease. Tenant agrees that the terms, covenants, provisions and conditions
of the Overleases applying to Landlord as the tenant thereunder shall apply
directly to Tenant, and Tenant hereby does and shall assume and perform fully
all the duties, obligations, liabilities and undertakings of Landlord as the
tenant under each and all of the Overleases, including as Rent under this
Lease, payment of all the fixed, basic rents and additional rents and any and
all other payments to be made pursuant to the Overleases, whether arising
before, on or after the Effective Date. In the event of any inconsistency
between the terms, covenants, provisions and conditions of any such Overlease
and the terms, covenants, provisions and conditions of this Lease as the same
applies to the Premises or common areas on a Leasehold Property, in that the
Overlease imposes an obligation or liability on the tenant thereunder (and
therefore on Tenant under this Lease by virtue of Tenants assumption
thereof) which is stricter or broader or more onerous or not covered by this

  



        
   

  



  

Lease, then, even though the subject matter may be one which is the same in
both the Overlease and this Lease, the terms, covenants, provisions and
conditions of the Overlease with respect to such obligation or liability
shall control and be complied with by Tenant. Tenant and Landlord each agrees
that it will not do, or cause or suffer to be done, any act (whether of
commission or omission) which would result in a breach of or default under
any term, covenant, provision or condition of any Overlease. A default under
an Overlease not caused by Tenant shall not constitute a default under this
Lease.

  



  

(d) Landlord shall have no responsibility or liability to provide any
services to Tenant with respect to either the Premises, or for performing any
of the duties, obligations, liabilities or undertakings of any landlord or
tenant under any Overlease as it applies to the Premises or to a Property
Location. Landlord agrees, however, that in cases where Landlords
cooperation is necessary to enforce rights of the tenant under any of the
Overleases, Landlord will use its reasonable efforts to cause
the Overlandlords to perform their duties, obligations, liabilities
and undertakings thereunder, provided Tenant agrees to and does bear the
expense and reimburse Landlord (immediately upon demand) for any and all
expenses including reasonable experts and attorneys fees incurred by
Landlord in connection therewith. To the extent that to do so does not
prejudice or impair the rights and remedies intended to be enjoyed by
Landlord under this Lease and does not in any manner or to any degree impose
(with respect to any Overlease) or increase (with respect to this Lease) the
duties, obligations, liabilities or undertakings of Landlord and does not
modify or terminate an Overlease, Landlord agrees to otherwise cooperate with
Tenant so that all of the rights and benefits of the Overleases intended to
be enjoyed by the prime tenants thereunder shall be available to Tenant,
except Tenant shall not have or enjoy any options to cancel or terminate an
Overlease, or surrender the premises covered by an Overlease, or to renew or
to extend an Overlease (except as provided for in _Section 32.01(q))_ , or to
purchase the fee title, or to exercise rights of first refusal, or have any
rights to encumber, assign or sublet the interest of the tenant under the
Overleases (except as provided for in _Article 12)_ , or rights to build
additional buildings or improvements (except as provided for in _Articles 11,
14 and 15)_. At Tenants full cost and expense and without expense to
Landlord, Tenant may obtain from each Overlandlord a non-disturbance
agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Tenant.

  



  

(e) In addition to other indemnification provisions by Tenant in this Lease,
and not in limitation thereof, Tenant hereby agrees to indemnify, save,
protect, defend and hold harmless the Landlord Indemnified Parties harmless
from and against any and all liabilities, suits, obligations, fines, damages,
penalties, claims, costs, charges and expenses (including experts and
attorneys fees) imposed upon or incurred by the Landlord Indemnified
Parties, that may be based on or asserted or alleged to be based on any
breach by Tenant of any term, covenant, provision or condition of any
Overlease arising before or during the Term of this Lease.

  



  

(f) In the event of any damage or destruction, or in the event of any taking
of all or part of any Leasehold Property, the terms, covenants, provisions
and conditions of the Overlease for such Leasehold Property shall not be the
controlling instrument as between Landlord and Tenant, but the provisions of
this Lease relating to such event shall control exclusively between Landlord
and Tenant.

  



        
   

  



  

(g) Landlord shall not amend or modify any Overlease without Tenants
consent, which consent may be withheld, delayed or conditioned at Tenants
sole discretion, for any reason or for no reason. Landlord shall not
voluntarily terminate or consent to any termination of such Overlease for any
reason without Tenants written consent, which consent may be
withheld, delayed or conditioned at Tenants sole discretion, for any reason
or for no reason. If either Tenant defaults under an Overlease or Landlord
acts or fails to act in a manner which results in a default under an
Overlease, then the other party (upon reasonable advance written notice to
the defaulting party, unless the Overlease is in imminent danger of
termination, in which case notice that is feasible under the circumstances
shall be given to the defaulting party) may cure such default (but shall have
no obligation to do so) if after the notice the defaulting party fails to
take steps to effect such cure.

  



  

(h) Subject to _subsection (d)_ of this _Article 32_ , the performance by
Overlandlord of Overlandlords obligations in accordance with any of the
Overleases, shall, for all purposes, be accepted by Tenant, and shall be
deemed to be the performance of such obligations by Landlord under the
provisions of such Overlease and also under this Lease to the extent the
obligations are the same, and in such case Tenant shall neither look to
Landlord for performance of such obligations nor seek to hold Landlord liable
for performance of such obligations or for the manner of performance of such
obligations or for any default in performance or non-performance of such
obligations.

  



  

(i) Whenever, by reason of Tenants assumption of all the obligations
contained in an Overlease as provided in this  _Article 32_ or otherwise, any
provision of the Overlease requires the tenant thereunder to make any payment
of any money, including the fixed, base rent payable thereunder, or requires
such tenant to take any action within a certain period of time (whether with
or without notice), then, notwithstanding that a provision in this Lease
calls for such payment to be made or action to be taken at a different time,
Tenant shall make such payment to the Overlandlord, Landlord or other
appropriate third party or take such action, as the case may be, within the
shorter of the time specified in this Lease or the time specified in the
Overlease; and if such payment or other action is required to be paid or
taken within a specified time period after notice or receipt of an invoice,
then upon such notice or upon receipt of such invoice, Tenant shall make such
payment or take such other action, as the case may be, no later than five (5)
business days prior to the last day of such time period (excluding, however,
installments of fixed or base rent or other payments due under the Overleases
which shall be paid by Tenant directly to the Overlandlord pursuant to the
Overlease).

  



  

(j) Whenever any provision of an Overlease requires the Overlandlord to give
notice or submit an invoice to the tenant thereunder and Landlord has
received such notice or invoice but the Overlandlord has not given Tenant
such notice or invoice directly, then Landlord shall notify Tenant by sending
Tenant a copy of said notice or invoice. Such notification by Landlord to
Tenant of said Overlandlords notice or invoice shall for all purposes
hereunder be deemed timely given if sent to Tenant within five (5) business
days after receipt by Landlord of the notice from Overlandlord.

  



  

(k) Whenever any provision of an Overlease requires the tenant under the
Overlease to obtain the Overlandlords consent for any purpose, including
obtaining consent prior to the undertaking of an act or proposed act, and
Tenant desires such consent, such

  



        
   

  



  

provision shall for all purposes hereunder be deemed to require the prior
written consent of both Overlandlord and Landlord; provided, however, if
Landlord is willing to consent, Landlord, at Tenants expense, shall
cooperate to a reasonable extent with Tenant to obtain the Overlandlords
consent provided Tenant pays all Landlords expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees, in Landlords extending such cooperation.

  



  

(l) If Tenant contends that Overlandlord is not observing, complying with or
performing its obligations under the Overlease, Tenant shall have the right
to notify Landlord of a default of the Overlandlord which notice shall
specify the nature of such default. Within five (5) business days after its
receipt of such notice, Landlord shall give written notice to Overlandlord
(in the manner required by the Overlease), which notice shall specify the
nature of such claimed default in the same manner as was specified in
Tenants notice to Landlord. Landlord further agrees to extend assistance to
and cooperate with Tenant in order to effectuate a cure of any alleged
default, provided that all costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, in connection therewith are borne by Tenant. If
(i) Tenant shall have given written notice to Landlord of such default by
the Overlandlord, as aforesaid, (ii) the Overlease allows withholding of
such payments from the Overlandlord and (iii) Landlord consents in writing,
Tenant also shall have the right to withhold payments of that portion of the
Overlease rent payable to the Overlandlord which is payable by Landlord at
that time under the Overlease in accordance with the applicable provision, if
any, of the Overlease allowing such withholding of rent. Tenant agrees that
it will defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Landlord Indemnified Parties
from and against any and all Losses arising from or related to any matter
described in this _subsection (l)_.

  



  

(m) Whenever in this Lease rights or privileges are granted to Landlord or
Tenant with respect to any matter or thing, such rights or privileges shall
be exercisable by Landlord insofar as the same are not inconsistent with, or
in violation of, the terms, covenants and conditions of the Overlease with
respect to the same matter or thing and the terms, rights and privileges
granted to Landlord and Tenant herein, but where the rights and privileges
granted by the Overlease to the tenant thereunder exceed the rights and
privileges granted in this Lease to Landlord or Tenant, then Landlord or
Tenant shall exercise such rights and privileges only to the extent expressly
permitted herein if the result of exercising the greater rights or privileges
in the Overlease would be detrimental to the other party hereto.

  



  

(n) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article 32_ , if an Overlease
would need to be extended by Landlord exercising an extension option in that
Overlease in order to match Tenants exercise of an Extension Option under
this Lease, then, as a condition for Tenants Extension Option to be validly
exercised under this Lease, Tenant must give Landlord notice of Tenants
exercise of the Extension Option under this Lease at least thirty (30) days
prior to the deadline set forth in the Overlease for validly exercising the
extension option under the Overlease, time being of the essence.

  



  

(o) As to each Leasehold Property, upon Tenants written notice, Landlord,
subject to the proviso in this sentence and subject also to the other
provisions and conditions in this _Article 32_ , shall from time to time
exercise Landlords rights to the extent necessary and to the extent
available to Landlord, in order to extend the term of the Overlease
applicable to that Leasehold Property until at least the Expiration Date;
provided, however Landlord need not (i)

  



        
   

  



  

exercise its extension rights if on the date Landlords notice of extension
of the Overlease is to be given to the landlord under an Overlease (each, an
" _Overlandlord_ " and collectively, the " _Overlandlords_ "), a Default on
the part of Tenant then exists under this Lease, and (ii) exercise the
extension of an Overlease until the one hundred eightieth (180th) day prior
to the deadline for exercising such Overlease extension pursuant to its terms
(or until the first (1st) day that such Overlease extension option may be
exercised by Landlord if such date would occur less than one hundred eighty
(180) days after the date of Tenants notice advising Landlord to exercise
the extension option), and Landlord simultaneously provides Tenant with
written confirmation of same. In the event Landlord fails to timely exercise
the extension option, as provided above, Landlord hereby grants Tenant the
right to exercise such extension option on Landlords behalf and, in
furtherance thereof, grants Tenant a limited power of attorney
to acknowledge, deliver and execute, on Landlords behalf, such documentation
as is required to effectuate the exercise of the extension option. Tenant
shall provide Landlord with copies of any documentation relating to Tenants
exercise of an extension option made on Landlords behalf. To the extent that
the term of any Overlease, as extended, extends beyond the Expiration Date of
the Master Lease, Landlord, at its sole cost and expense, bears the
obligation to pay any rent applicable to such period under the Overlease. If
Tenant does not request that Landlord (or Landlord is not required due to
Tenants Default  as described above) to exercise any option available to
Landlord to extend the term of an Overlease and Landlord does not, in fact,
exercise such extension option, then this Lease shall terminate as to the
Leasehold Property and Landlord and Tenant shall modify this Lease to remove
such Leasehold Property that is subject to the Overlease as to which Landlord
did not exercise the extension option effective as of the date of expiration
of the subject Overlease, and, following such removal, this Lease shall
continue in full force and effect as to the remaining Property Locations and
Tenant shall surrender to Landlord that portion of the Premises upon which
the Leasehold Property is located, and Tenant shall have no further
responsibility to Landlord with respect to such removed Leasehold Property,
except for such indemnity or other provisions of this Lease which may relate
to such removed Leasehold Property.

  



  

(p) As to any period before the end of the initial Term of this Lease, Tenant
shall have the right to notify Landlord by sending Landlord a written notice
stating expressly that Tenant desires Landlord not to exercise an extension
option under an Overlease and that Tenant desires the Overlease to expire.
The notice must be received by Landlord not less than one hundred twenty
(120) days before the last day on which Landlord is required to exercise its
extension option under the Overlease, time being of the essence. If Landlord
receives such notice, Landlord may either intentionally fail to exercise the
Overlease extension option and permit the Overlease to expire, or Landlord
may exercise its extension option for Landlords own account. In either case,
this Lease shall terminate as to the Leasehold Property and Landlord and
Tenant shall modify this Lease to remove such Leasehold Property that is
subject to the Overlease effective as of the date of expiration of the
subject Overlease or the date the extension period of the Overlease
commences, as applicable, and, following such removal, this Lease shall
continue in full force and effect as to the remaining Property Locations and
Tenant shall surrender to Landlord that portion of the Premises upon
which the Leasehold Property is located, and Tenant shall have no
further responsibility to Landlord with respect to such removed Leasehold
Property, except for such indemnity or other provisions of this Lease which
may relate to such removed Leasehold Property.

  



        
   

  



  

(q) When Landlord sends a notice to an Overlandlord extending the term of the
Overlease, Landlord will send a copy of that notice to Tenant. Within thirty
(30) days after receipt by Landlord of a notice from Tenant extending this
Lease in accordance with and subject to the provisions and conditions in
_Sections 32(n), (o) and (p)_ , Landlord will send its own extension notice
to the Overlandlord (when extension is necessary) extending the Overlease. If
Tenant does not receive from Landlord the copy of Landlords extension notice
to the Overlandlord by the thirtieth (30th) day after the date Tenant had
sent its own valid notice to Landlord and also has not received a notice from
Landlord disputing Landlords duty to exercise an option to extend the
Overlease, then, in such case, Tenant itself may exercise the extension
option under the Overlease, on Landlords behalf and acting in place and
stead of Landlord, by notice to the Overlandlord.

  



  

(r) If any Overlease does not contain sufficient extension options for
Landlord (as tenant thereunder) to be able to keep granting Tenant extensions
thereof as to any Leasehold Property to match the term of this Lease or
Tenants exercise of an extension option in accordance with this Lease, and
the leasehold estate of that Leasehold Property shall therefore expire before
the then current term of this Lease will have expired, then in each such case
(i) that particular Leasehold Property shall no longer be part of the
Premises under this Lease, (ii) without liability to Landlord, this Lease
shall terminate as to the Leasehold Location, (iii) Landlord and Tenant shall
modify this Lease to remove such Leasehold Property that is subject to the
expired Overlease effective as of the date of expiration of the subject
Overlease, (iv) following such removal, this Lease shall continue in full
force and effect as to the remaining Property Locations, (v) Tenant shall
surrender to Landlord that portion of the Premises upon which the Leasehold
Property is located, and (iv) Tenant shall have no further responsibility to
Landlord with respect to such removed Leasehold Property, except for such
indemnity or other provisions of this Lease which may relate to such removed
Leasehold Property.

  



  

(s) Landlord hereby agrees to indemnify, save, protect, defend and hold
Tenant harmless from and against any and all actual damages and out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including experts and attorneys fees) imposed upon or
incurred by Tenant as a result of any default under an Overlease on behalf of
the tenant thereunder that is directly the result of the actions of Landlord
or omissions of Landlord including, but not limited to, the failure of
Landlord to utilize the Overlease Reserve for the payment of amounts due
under an Overlease; provided, however, that where an Overlease Reserve is in
place, Landlord hereby agrees to indemnify, save, protect, defend and hold
Tenant harmless from and against any and all Losses resulting from Landlords
failure to pay rents under the applicable Overlease.

  



  

(t) The parties acknowledge that the Overlease related to Store No. 141,
located in Burlington, Iowa ("Store 141"), contains an option to purchase the
Store No. 141 real estate (the "Store 141 Property") at fair market value,
exercisable on January 1, 2007 or on January 1, 2012 (the "Option"). Landlord
shall exercise the Option on either January 1, 2007 or January 1, 2012 (such
date selection to be at Landlords sole discretion), and upon Landlords
acquisition of the Store 141 Property, (a) the Store 141 Property shall be
converted from a Leasehold Property to a Fee Property without further action
of Landlord or Tenant hereunder, (b) any ground lease payments previously
made by Tenant to the Overlease Landlord shall be made by Tenant directly to
Landlord, and (c) subject to Section 2.01 hereunder, the Base Rent shall
remain the same.

# **EXHIBIT B 
  
 LIMITED PERMITTED ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLEASE RENTS**

  

# ** **

  

Tenant has a limited collective ability to assign and sublease a portion of
the aggregate square footage of real estate subject to the Lease. For square
footage that is either sublet with a corresponding non-disturbance agreement
or which is assigned, Tenant will seek to obtain initial rents at market
rates, but in no event less than a determined minimum (" _Determined Minimum_
"). The Determined Minimum rents for individual Property Locations shall be
computed by multiplying (i) a fraction (the " _Quotient_ "), the numerator of
which will be the allocated loan amount assigned to the particular Property
Location as set forth in a loan agreement between Landlord and Landlords
Lender and the denominator of which will be the Total Loan Amount, by (ii)
the current Base Rent payment. The " _Total Loan Amount_ " shall mean the
combined sum of all of the allocated loan amounts assigned to all of the
Property Locations under this Lease as set forth in the loan agreement as
obtained or modified by Landlords existing or future Lenders from time to
time (the " _Allocated Loan Amounts_ "). The Allocated Loan Amounts shall be
subject to change after the Effective Date upon sixty (60) days prior written
notice to Tenant if Landlord refinances or modifies the loan secured by the
Premises with an unaffiliated third party Lender (with such refinancing
or modification not to occur more than once every three (3) years);
such Allocated Loan Amounts may change based solely on a change in the fair
market value of the Property Locations established by new appraisals to the
extent such Lender requires new appraisals to determine the then-current
Allocated Loan Amount. If such Allocated Loan Amounts change, Landlord shall
promptly notify Tenant of the revised Allocated Loan Amounts. If no new
Allocated Loan Amounts are required by any new lenders, Landlord and Tenant
shall rely on the Allocated Loan Amounts in effect as of the Effective Date.

 **THIS** **SUBORDINATION, NON-DISTURBANCE AND ATTORNMENT AGREEMENT** (this "
**Agreement** ") is made as of the day of , 2006,
by and between **** , a
, having its principal place of business at  (together
with its successors and/or assigns, " **Lender** ") and
, a  having an address at
 " **Tenant** ").

  



  

RECITALS:

  



  

A. Lender has advanced a loan to , a
 (" **Borrower** ") in the principal sum of  
**DOLLARS ($ )** (the " **Loan** ") advanced pursuant
to that certain Loan Agreement of even date herewith between Borrower and
Lender (together with all extensions, renewals, modifications, substitutions
and amendments thereof, the " **Loan Agreement** ").

  



  

B. The Loan is secured by, among other things, the Security Instrument (as
defined in the Loan Agreement) which grants Lender a first lien on the
Properties (as defined in the Loan Agreement) encumbered thereby and is
further evidenced by the Note (as defined in the Loan Agreement).

  



  

C. Borrower has entered into a certain Lease Agreement dated as of the date
hereof (the " **Lease** ") with Tenant, which Lease relates to the Properties.

  



  

D. Tenant has agreed to confirm the subordination of the Lease to the
Security Instrument and to the liens thereof on the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth.

  



  

AGREEMENT:

  



  

For good and valuable consideration, Tenant and Lender agree as follows:

  



  

 **1. _Subordination_**. The Lease is and shall at all times be subject and
subordinate in all respects to the terms, covenants and provisions of the
Security Instrument and to the liens thereof, including without limitation,
all renewals, increases, modifications, spreaders,
consolidations, replacements and extensions thereof and to all sums secured
thereby and advances made thereunder with the same force and effect as if the
Security Instrument had been executed, delivered and recorded prior to the
execution and delivery of the Lease.

  



  

 **2.** **_Non-Disturbance and Attornment_**. If Lender or any
other subsequent purchaser of the Properties shall become the owner of the
Properties by reason of the foreclosure of the Security Instrument or the
acceptance of a deed or assignment in lieu of foreclosure or by reason of any
other enforcement of the Security Instrument (Lender or such other purchaser
being hereinafter referred as " **Purchaser** "), provided no event of
default exists under the Lease, (a) Purchaser shall not (i) disturb Tenants
possession of the Properties nor (ii) name Tenant as a party to any
foreclosure or other proceeding to enforce the terms of the Security
Instrument and (b) any sale or other transfer of the Properties or of
Borrowers interest in the Lease, pursuant to foreclosure of the Security
Instrument or the acceptance of a deed or assignment in lieu of foreclosure
or by reason of any other enforcement of the Security Instrument, will be
subject and

  



        
   

  



  

subordinate to Tenants possession and rights under the Lease; and (c) the
Lease shall not be terminated or affected thereby but shall continue in full
force and effect as a direct lease between Purchaser and Tenant upon all of
the terms, covenants and conditions set forth in the Lease and in that event,
Tenant agrees to attorn to Purchaser and Purchaser by virtue of such
acquisition of the Properties shall be deemed to have agreed to accept such
attornment, provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be (i) liable for the
failure of any prior landlord (any such prior landlord, including Borrower
and any successor landlord, being hereinafter referred to as a " **Prior
Landlord** ") to perform any of its obligations under the Lease which have
accrued prior to the date on which Purchaser shall become the owner of the
Properties; (ii) subject to any offsets, defenses, abatements or
counterclaims which shall have accrued in favor of Tenant against any Prior
Landlord prior to the date upon which Purchaser shall become the owner of the
Properties; (iii) liable for the return of rental security deposits, if any,
paid by Tenant to any Prior Landlord in accordance with the Lease unless such
sums are actually received by Purchaser; (iv) bound by any payment of rents,
additional rents or other sums which Tenant may have paid more than one (1)
month in advance to any Prior Landlord unless such sums are actually received
by Purchaser; (v) bound by any modification or amendment of the Lease, or any
waiver of the terms of the Lease, made without Lenders written consent; or
(vi) any consensual or negotiated surrender, cancellation, or termination of
the Lease, in whole or in part, agreed upon between Borrower and Tenant,
unless effected unilaterally by Tenant pursuant to the express terms of the
Lease. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) herein, the foregoing shall not limit
either (1) Tenants right to exercise any offsets, defenses,
claims, reductions, deductions or abatements otherwise available to Tenant
because of events occurring before or after the date of attornment to the
extent Lender has received notice thereof and the opportunity to cure within
the time periods set forth in this Agreement (it being further agreed that
offsets, reductions, deductions or abatements under the Lease that were
deducted by Tenant prior to the date upon which Purchaser succeeds to the
interest of Prior Landlord shall not be subject to challenge), or (2)
Purchasers liability for any defaults that continue after the date
of attornment that violate Purchasers obligations as landlord under the
Lease. In the event that any liability of Purchaser does arise pursuant to
this Agreement, such liability shall be limited and restricted to
Purchasers interest in the Properties and shall in no event exceed such
interest.

  



  

 **3. _Notices_**. All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be given
and become effective as provided in Loan Agreement. Notices to the Tenant
shall be addressed as follows:

 **4. _Lender s Right of Access_**. Tenant agrees that Lender shall have
the rights of access to the Properties for the purpose of curing a
default under the Lease as granted to Borrower pursuant to the terms of the
Lease and Lender agrees not to disturb the normal business operations of
Tenant at such Properties in connection therewith.

  



  

 **5. _Notice to Lender_**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
Lease or this Agreement, before exercising any offset right or termination
right, Tenant agrees that it shall deliver to Lender a copy of any written
notice of the breach or default by Borrower giving rise to same (the "
**Default Notice** "), and, thereafter, the opportunity to cure such breach
or default as provided for below.

  



  

 **6. _Cure_**. After Lender receives a Default Notice, Lender shall have a
period of thirty (30) days beyond the time available to Landlord under the
Lease in which to cure the breach or default by Borrower. Lender shall have
no obligation to cure (and shall have no liability or obligation for not
curing) any breach or default by Borrower, except to the extent that Lender
agrees or undertakes otherwise in writing. In addition, as to any breach or
default by Lender the cure of which requires possession and control of a
Property, provided that Lender undertakes by written notice to Tenant to
exercise reasonable efforts to cure or cause to be cured by a receiver such
breach or default within the period permitted by this paragraph, Lenders
cure period shall continue for such additional time (the " **Extended Cure
Period** ") as Lender may reasonably require to either: (a) obtain possession
and control of the applicable Property with due diligence and thereafter cure
the breach or default with reasonable diligence and continuity; or (b) obtain
the appointment of a receiver and give such receiver a reasonable period of

Personal Property as collateral, the undersigned agree as follows:

2\. Except as otherwise provided in the lease relating to the Premises
between Landlord and Debtor as in effect on the date hereof (the "Lease"),
the Personal Property may be installed in or located on the Premises and is
not and shall not be deemed a fixture or part of the real property but shall
at all times be considered personal property.

  



  

3\. Agent, at its option, for itself and for the benefit of Lenders, may
enter and use the Premises for the purpose of repossessing, removing, selling
or otherwise dealing with any of the Personal Property, and such license

Date") which is the earlier of (w) five (5) business days following
Landlords receipt of written notice from Agent that Agent intends to enter
the Premises pursuant to the rights granted to Agent hereunder or (x) five
(5) business days following Agents receipt of written notice from Landlord
that the Lease has terminated in accordance with Section 4 hereof, and such
license shall expire on the date (the "Access Termination Date") that
is ninety

  



        
   

  



  

(90) days after the Access Commencement Date; _provided_ , _that_ , (a) for
each day from the Access Commencement Date through the earlier of the Access
Termination Date or the date on which Agent notifies Landlord in writing that

rights granted to it hereunder, Agent shall (i) maintain or cause to be
maintained such insurance as is required by the Debtor to be maintained as
provided under the Lease, (ii) unless Landlord has otherwise been paid rent
in respect of any such period, Agent shall pay the regularly scheduled rent

without thereby assuming the Lease or incurring any other Obligations of
Debtor and , (iii) without duplication of the payments under clause (ii)
above, pay or cause to be paid all utilities costs attributable to the
Premises in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Lease, without
thereby assuming the Lease or incurring any other obligations of Debtor, (b)

repaired by Agent at the sole expense of Lenders, (c) Agent agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless from and against any and all
damages, losses, claims, judgments, liabilities, costs and expense
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) resulting or arising from
the activities of Agent on the Premises, except for those damages, losses,
claims, judgments, liabilities, costs and expense caused by the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord and (d) Landlord shall be
entitled to inspect the Premises and to show the Premises to prospective
tenants and purchasers from time to time.

damages or abatement of rent or relieve Debtor from the responsibility of
performing any of Debtors obligations under the Lease, and Debtor shall have
no right or claim against Landlord for or by reason of any such entry or

Exhibit C

  



  

The Seller is duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and has all requisite
corporate power to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted, except for any such failure that would have
a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

The execution, delivery and performance of the Stock Purchase Agreement by
the Seller and the consummation by the Seller of the transactions
contemplated thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of the Seller. The Stock Purchase Agreement constitutes
the valid and binding obligation of the Seller, and is enforceable in
accordance with its terms.

  



  

Neither the execution, delivery or performance of the Stock Purchase
Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby,
will (i) violate or conflict with or result in a breach, in any material
respect of any Law binding the Seller, or (ii) violate, conflict with or
constitute a default under any constituent documents of the Seller.
