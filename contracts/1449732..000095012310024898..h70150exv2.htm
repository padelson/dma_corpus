<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;4.31 <U>Financing</U>. Parent has delivered to the Company a true, correct and
complete copy, executed by all applicable parties (including Parent and its subsidiary Willbros
United States Holdings, Inc., in each case to the extent required to create a binding agreement),
of the commitment letter of Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, UBS Securities LLC and
UBS Loan Finance LLC, dated as of the date hereof, pursuant to which such persons have agreed,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide an aggregate of $475,000,000 of
financing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the &#147;<U>Financing Letter</U>&#148;).
The Financing Letter has not been amended, supplemented or otherwise modified in a manner that
would be prohibited by <U>Section&nbsp;5.21.1</U>. The Financing Letter is in full force and effect as
of the date hereof in accordance with its terms. The Financing Letter is subject to no
contingencies or conditions (including pursuant to the fee letter(s) executed in connection
therewith) other than (a)&nbsp;those set forth in the copy of the fully executed Financing Letter
delivered to the Company and (b)&nbsp;any relevant provisions of the accompanying fee letter in the
form disclosed to the Company on or prior to the date hereof (collectively, the &#147;<U>Disclosed
Financing Letters</U>&#148;) . Parent has fully paid, or caused to be paid, any and all commitment fees
and other amounts required by the Financing Letter or the accompanying fee letter(s) to be paid by
it or any of its affiliates on or prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or, to the knowledge
of Parent, any other parties thereto under, or a basis for termination by any party thereto of, the
Financing Letter. As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor any Merger Sub has any reason to
believe that any of the
conditions to the financing contemplated by the Disclosed Financing Letters will not be
satisfied or, subject to the Flex provisions, that any portion of the financing contemplated
thereunder will not be made available to Parent or the Merger Subs on the Closing Date. Assuming
the accuracy of the representations and warranties in <U>Section&nbsp;3.3</U> of the Company and
compliance in all material respects by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with the agreements
set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;5.1</U>, the funds in the amounts set forth in the Financing Letter, along
with Parent&#146;s cash as of the date of this Agreement, will be sufficient to enable Parent and the
Merger Subs to pay all amounts to be paid in cash to Participating Holders under this Agreement,
including the cash portion of the Total Merger Consideration, to make all other necessary cash
payments by them in connection with the Mergers upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement
(including the repayment of certain Closing Date Indebtedness as contemplated by <U>Section
2.7.6</U>) and in connection with the Financing (as defined below) and to pay all of the related
fees and expenses, in each case as contemplated by the Financing Letter. The financing referred to
in the Financing Letter is herein referred to as the &#147;<U>Financing</U>.&#148;

delay materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party with respect to the defense of such

notice properly given, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, at its sole discretion, to assume
the entire defense of such Indemnification Claim (with counsel selected by it which is reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Person or Persons), and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the
