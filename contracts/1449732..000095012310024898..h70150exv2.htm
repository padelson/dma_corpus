After the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Preferred Stock and all shares of Company Common Stock issued in the Conversion shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share which, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented such shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the consideration set forth in this _Section 2.1_ for each share of Company Common Stock received upon the Conversion, subject to _Section 2.1.7_ and _Section 2.7.2_.

   ##### 

  

    

exchange or national quotation system on which Parent Common Stock is then
listed or quoted) ending at the close of trading on the Determination Date
(in the event that on any trading day within such 10 consecutive trading day
period there are no trades of Parent Common Stock, then the closing price

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, only Persons that are Accredited Investors shall receive Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1_ or Parent Preferred Stock pursuant to _Section 2.2.5.3_ or _Section 2.6.3.2_. Each share of Company Common Stock held by a Company Shareholder that, but for not being an Accredited Investor, would be entitled to receive Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock as part of the Total Per Share Common Consideration (" _Cash-Out Shares_ "), will instead, by virtue of Merger I and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive the Total Per Share Consideration in cash. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 2.2 _Earnout_. The Earnout Amounts payable shall be determined as follows: 

    

 Section 2.2.1 _2010 Earnout Amount_. If the EBITDA for the period beginning on January 1, 2010, and ending on December 31, 2010 (the " _2010 Earnout Period_ ") is equal to or greater than $69,825,000, then the " _2010 Earnout Amount_ " shall be an amount increasing linearly from $10,000,000 at an EBITDA of $69,825,000 to $40,000,000 at an EBITDA of $80,000,000 or greater. The calculation of the 2010 Earnout Amount shall be in accordance with the foregoing and the table set forth on _Exhibit D_ attached hereto. 

   

 Section 2.2.2 _2011 Earnout Amount_. If the EBITDA for the period beginning on January 1, 2011, and ending on December 31, 2011 (the " _2011 Earnout Period_ ") is equal to or greater than $80,000,000, then the " _2011 Earnout Amount_ " shall be an amount increasing linearly from $10,000,000 at an EBITDA of $80,000,000 to $60,000,000 at an EBITDA of $95,000,000 or greater. The calculation of the 2011 Earnout Amount shall be in accordance with the foregoing and the table set forth on _Exhibit D_ attached hereto. 

   

 Section 2.2.3 _Bonus Earnout Amount_. If the EBITDA for the period beginning on January 1, 2010, and ending on December 31, 2011, is equal to or greater than $175,000,000, then the " _Bonus Earnout Amount_ " shall be an amount increasing linearly from $1 at an EBITDA of $175,000,000 to $25,000,000 at an EBITDA of $190,000,000 or greater. The calculation of the Bonus Earnout Amount shall be in accordance with the foregoing and the table set forth on  _Exhibit D_ attached hereto. 

   

 Section 2.2.4 _Time for Determination_. As promptly as possible, but in any event within 30 days after the completion of the audited financial statements of Parent for each of the Earnout Periods, Parent will deliver to the Seller Representative a statement (an " _Earnout Statement_ ") setting forth Parents calculation of the EBITDA for the applicable Earnout Period, which shall be prepared in accordance with _Exhibit E_, together with the audited financial statements for such Earnout Period. After delivery of the Earnout Statement, the Seller Representative and its accountants shall be permitted reasonable access during normal business hours to review Parents and the Surviving Companys books and records and any work papers (including any work papers of Parents and the Surviving Companys accountants) related to the preparation of the Earnout Statement, subject to such confidentiality restrictions as the accountants shall reasonably request. The Seller Representative and its accountants may make inquiries of Parent, the Surviving Company and their respective accountants and employees regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the Earnout Statement arising in the course of their review thereof, and Parent shall use its, and shall cause the subsidiaries of the Surviving Company to use their, commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such accountants and employees to cooperate with and respond to such inquiries. If the Seller Representative has any objections to the Earnout Statement, the Seller Representative shall deliver to Parent a statement setting forth in reasonable detail each item in dispute, the amount thereof in dispute and the basis for its objections thereto (an " _Objections Statement_ "). If an Objections Statement is not delivered to Parent within 30 days after delivery of the Earnout 

   ##### 

  

    

Statement, the Earnout Statement shall be final, binding and non-appealable by
the parties hereto. The Seller Representative and Parent shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve any objections set forth in the Objections Statement
(and all such discussions related thereto shall, unless otherwise agreed by
Parent and the Seller Representative, be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal
Rules of Evidence (and any applicable similar state rule)), but if they
do not reach a final resolution within 30 days after the delivery of the
Objections Statement, the Seller Representative and Parent shall submit such
dispute to the Independent Auditor. If any dispute is submitted to the
Independent Auditor, each party will furnish to the Independent Auditor such
work papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed
issues as the Independent Auditor may request and are available to that party
or its accountants (including information of the Surviving Company and the
subsidiaries of the Surviving Company) and each party shall be entitled to
present the Independent Auditor material relating to the determination and to
discuss, in the presence of any other party, the determination with the
Independent Auditor. The Independent Auditor shall resolve only those matters
that remain in dispute after the 30-day resolution period. It is the intent of
Parent and the Company that the process set forth in this _Section 2.2.4_
and the activities of the Independent Auditor in connection herewith are not
intended to be and, in fact, are not arbitration and that the Independent
Auditor shall act as an auditor and not an arbitrator and no formal
arbitration rules shall be followed (including rules with respect to
procedures and discovery). The Seller Representative and Parent shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Auditor to
resolve all such disagreements as soon as practicable but in no event later
than 45 days after submission of the disputed issues to the Independent
Auditor. The resolution of the dispute by the Independent Auditor shall be
final, binding and non-appealable on the parties hereto; _provided, however_
, that this provision shall not prohibit either party from instituting
litigation to enforce any ruling of the Independent Auditor resolving any
such dispute. The Earnout Statement shall be modified if necessary to reflect
such determination. The fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor (or such
other person) shall be borne 50% by Parent, on the one hand, and 50% by the
Participating Holders, on the other hand; _provided, however_ , that, if the
Independent Auditor determines that one party is wholly and unequivocally
correct, then the other party will be solely responsible for such fees and
expenses; _provided further_ , that any such fees and expenses to be paid by
the Participating Holders may, at the Seller Representatives option, be paid
from the Expense Funds to the extent there are sufficient funds so
available.

 Section 2.2.5.2 To the extent any portion of the then-applicable Earnout Amount is to be treated as imputed interest in accordance with the Code and the Treasury Regulations, such imputed interest shall be, to the extent possible, allocable to the portion of such Earnout Amount paid in cash pursuant to _Section 2.2.5.1_. If, and only to the extent, the cash paid pursuant to  _Section 2.2.5.1_ is less than the total amount of such imputed interest, the remaining amount of such imputed interest (after allocating such imputed interest to the cash payment to the extent possible) shall be allocable to certain shares of Parent Preferred Stock paid pursuant to  _Section 2.2.5.3_, by treating the shares paid as comprising two components, a principal component and an interest component, the amounts of which shall be determined as provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.483-4(b) example (2) using the 3-month test rate of interest provided for in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1274-4(a)(1)(ii) employing the semiannual compounding period. As to each such payment of shares of Parent Preferred Stock to each Company Shareholder, shares representing the principal component (with a value equal to the principal component) and shares representing the interest component (with a value equal to the interest component) shall be represented by separate share certificates.

   ##### 

  

    

Parent Preferred Stock with a Preferred Fair Market Value (determined as of
the date of issuance of such shares) equal to such decrease in cash shall be
issued to such Company Shareholders, with such adjustments to be made in a
manner determined jointly by the Seller Representative and Parent so that the
sum of (I) the Common Fair Market Value of the aggregate shares of Parent
Common Stock and the Preferred Fair Market Value of the aggregate shares of
Parent Preferred Stock referenced in clauses (a) through (c) of this 
_Section 2.2.5.3_ (such Common Fair Market Value and Preferred Fair Market
Value determined as set forth in such clauses) _plus_ (II) the Preferred Fair
Market Value of the aggregate shares (other than any shares treated as
imputed interest) of Parent Preferred Stock issued in lieu of cash pursuant
to the then-applicable Earnout Amount payment (such Preferred Fair Market

After delivery of the Closing Statement, the Seller Representative and its accountants shall be permitted reasonable access during normal business hours to review the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries books and records and any work papers (including any work papers of Parents and the Companys accountants) related to the preparation of the Closing Statement, subject to such confidentiality restrictions as the accountants shall reasonably request. The Seller Representative and its accountants may make inquiries of Parent, the Company and their respective accountants and employees regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the Closing Statement arising in the course of their review thereof, 

   ##### 

  

    

and Parent shall use its, and shall cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to use their, commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such
accountants and employees to cooperate with and respond to such inquiries. If
the Seller Representative has any objections to the Closing Statement,
the Seller Representative shall deliver to Parent an Objections Statement. If
an Objections Statement is not delivered to Parent within 30 days after
delivery of the Closing Statement, the Closing Statement shall be final,
binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto. The Seller Representative
and Parent shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any objections set forth
in the Objections Statement (and all such discussions related thereto shall,
unless otherwise agreed by Parent and the Seller Representative, be governed
by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (and any applicable similar
state rule)), but if they do not reach a final resolution within 30 days
after the delivery of the Objections Statement, the Seller Representative and
Parent shall submit such dispute to Deloitte and Touche LLP (the " _Independent
Auditor_ "). If any dispute is submitted to the Independent Auditor,
each party will furnish to the Independent Auditor such work papers and other
documents and information relating to the disputed issues as the Independent
Auditor may request and are available to that party or its accountants
(including information of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) and each
party shall be entitled to present the Independent Auditor material relating
to the determination and to discuss, whether or not in the presence of
any other party, the determination with the Independent Auditor. The
Independent Auditor shall resolve only those matters that remain in dispute
after the 30-day resolution period. It is the intent of Parent and the
Company that the process set forth in this _Section 2.6.1_ and the
activities of the Independent Auditor in connection herewith are not intended
to be and, in fact, are not arbitration and that the Independent Auditor
shall act as an auditor and not an arbitrator and no formal arbitration rules
shall be followed (including rules with respect to procedures and discovery).
The Seller Representative and Parent shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Independent Auditor to resolve all such disagreements as
soon as practicable but in no event later than 45 days after submission
of the disputed issues to the Independent Auditor. The resolution of the
dispute by the Independent Auditor shall be final, binding and non-appealable
on the parties hereto;  _provided_ , _however_ , that this provision shall
not prohibit either party from instituting litigation to enforce any ruling
of the Independent Auditor resolving any such disputes. The Closing Statement
shall be modified if necessary to reflect such determination. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Auditor shall be borne 50% by Parent, on the one
hand, and 50% by the Participating Holders, on the other hand; _provided,
however_ , that, if the Independent Auditor determines that one party is
wholly and unequivocally correct, then the other party will be solely
responsible for such fees and expenses; _provided further_ , that any such
fees and expenses to be paid by the Participating Holders may be paid from
the Expense Fund.

In the event that the Final Adjustment Amount is greater than the value of the Working Capital Escrow Fund, the Participating Holders shall pay the excess to Parent in cash in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares. Payment of the Final Adjustment Amount shall be made within five Business Days after the date of final determination. 

  

 Section 2.6.3.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 2.6.3_ , if the net effect pursuant to _Section 2.6.3.1_ requires a payment by Parent, then, at the time of determination of the Final Adjustment Amount, in the event that the Common Fair Market Value of the Aggregate Stock Consideration (determined as of the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date) would otherwise represent less than 42% of the sum of (i) the Initial Aggregate Cash Consideration, _plus_ (ii) the aggregate amount of cash, if any, to be paid to Participating Holders pursuant to the Final Adjustment Amount, _plus_  (iii) the aggregate

respect of the Final Adjustment Amount shall be decreased, and in lieu thereof
a number of shares of Parent Preferred Stock with a Preferred Fair Market
Value (determined as of the date of issuance of such shares) equal to such
decrease in cash shall be issued to such Company Shareholders, with such
adjustments to be made in a manner to be determined jointly by the
Seller Representative and Parent so that the sum of (I) the Common Fair
Market Value of the Aggregate Stock Consideration (determined as of the
trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date)  _plus_ (II) the
Preferred Fair Market Value of the aggregate shares (other than any
shares treated as imputed interest) of Parent Preferred Stock issued in lieu

amount of cash, if any, to be paid to Participating Holders pursuant to the
Final Adjustment Amount, _plus_ (3) the aggregate amount of cash paid to

Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, there shall be paid to the holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest: (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section 2.8_ and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

   ##### 

  

   

 Section 2.7.11 _Clawback_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts distributed to a Participating Holder pursuant to this _Article II_ shall be subject to a clawback to the extent that, at any point following the Effective Time, such Participating Holder has received distributions in an aggregate amount that exceeds the amount that would be otherwise distributable to such Participating Holder on account of such Participating Holders Pro Rata Share as of such time. Each Participating Holder shall promptly remit to Parent or the Surviving Company the portion of such clawed back amount allocable to such Participating Holders Pro Rata Share, and Parent or the Surviving Company shall cause such clawed back amounts to be distributed to those Participating Holders who have received less than the Pro Rata Share applicable to such Participating Holder.

 Section 2.8 _No Fractional Shares_. 

    

 Section 2.8.1  _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1_, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock. For purposes of this _Section 2.8.1_, all fractional shares to which a single record holder would be entitled shall be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to three decimal places. 

   

 Section 2.8.2 _Cash In Lieu of Fractional Shares_. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each Company Shareholder who would otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without interest, rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (A) the amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled under this _Article II_ (or would be entitled but for this _Section 2.8.2_), _multiplied by_ (B) the Common Fair Market Value (determined as of the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date). 

   ##### 

  

   

 Section 2.8.3 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the Company Shareholders, RSU Holders and SAR Holders for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any Company Shareholder, RSU Holder or SAR Holder who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Company for payment of its claim for consideration (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock) to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.8.2_ and any applicable dividends or distributions with respect to any Parent Common Stock constituting consideration as provided in this _Article II_, in each case, without any interest thereon.

If any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares has not been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority), any such cash, shares, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 Section 2.8.5 _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, in direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares (" _Dissenter Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any person who is entitled to demand and properly demands payment for such Dissenter Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA (the " _Dissenter Rights_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the consideration set forth in _Section 2.1_, but rather the holders of Dissenter Shares shall be entitled to payment for such Dissenter Shares in accordance with the Dissenter Rights; _provided, however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to receive payment under the Dissenter Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid in accordance with the Dissenter Rights shall cease and such Dissenter Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the consideration as provided in  _Section 2.1_.

 Section 5.20.7 The parties hereto shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Mergers to qualify, and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts not to, and not to permit or cause any affiliate or any subsidiary to, take any actions or cause any action to be taken which would prevent the Mergers from qualifying, as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code. Each party agrees to report the Mergers consistently therewith, including complying with the reporting and record keeping requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-3.

Company) by filing one or more lawsuits against any party to the Financing
Letters (or the similar agreements for any Bond Financing and/or any
Alternative Financing) to fully enforce their obligations and the rights of
Parent thereunder). Parent shall inform the Company on a reasonably current
basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to comply
with the terms of, and satisfy the conditions contemplated by, the Financing
Letter (and the similar agreements for any Bond Financing and any Alternative
Financing, if applicable) in accordance with this _Section 5.21.1_ and shall
not amend, supplement or otherwise modify the terms of the Financing Letter
(or the similar agreements for any Bond Financing and/or any Alternative
Financing) (in each case including all exhibits, annexes, schedules, fee
letters and other ancillary documents) to increase the conditionality or
otherwise change the terms thereof in a manner that would adversely impact
the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions provided for herein or
the likelihood of the consummation of the Mergers without obtaining the prior
written consent of the Company, in each case except as may be contractually
required in connection with any Flex provisions. Parent shall give the
Company prompt written notice, but in any event within three Business Days
after Parent becomes aware thereof, of any material breach by any party to
the Financing Letter (or the similar agreements for any Bond Financing or any
Alternative Financing), any termination of any of the Financing Letter (or
the similar agreements for any Bond Financing or any Alternative Financing),
any exercise by the applicable parties of any of their Flex rights, or any
other circumstance, event or condition that would reasonably be likely to
prevent, delay or impede the consummation of the financing contemplated by
the Financing Letter (or the similar agreements for any Bond Financing or any
Alternative Financing). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its affiliates to, without the
prior written consent of the Company, take any action or enter into any
transaction, including any merger, acquisition, joint venture, disposition,
contract or debt or equity financing, that could reasonably be expected to
impair, delay or prevent consummation of the Financing (or, if applicable, of
any Bond Financing or any Alternative Financing). In the event that all or
any portion of the financing contemplated by the Financing Letter becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth in the Financing Letter (as
such terms (other than as to the aggregate amount of financing available
at Closing) may be altered in accordance with the Flex), Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event and after giving the Company prior written notice,
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by

this Agreement on terms that would not reasonably be expected to prevent,
delay or impede the consummation of any remaining financing contemplated by
the Financing Letter or otherwise adversely impact the ability of Parent to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the likelihood
of the consummation of the Mergers (the " _Alternative Financing_
"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall have the right to substitute
a high yield bond financing, on terms taken as a whole no less favorable to
Parent and its subsidiaries in all material respects than the Financing, for
all or any portion of the Financing, whether such bond financing is with the
same or alternative financing sources (a " _Bond Financing_ "), in which case
Parent shall not be deemed to be in breach of its agreements set forth herein
to arrange and close the Financing concurrently with the Closing if and to
the extent the proceeds of such Bond Financing are available to Parent on the
Closing Date to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all
agreements pursuant to which it has received commitments for the Alternative
Financing and/or the Bond Financing or otherwise entered into in
connection therewith. 

   

 Section 5.21.2 The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to, and to cause its and their respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement and syndication of the Financing, the Bond Financing, or the Alternative Financing, as applicable, including (a) providing financial and other information relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and identifying any information relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as either containing or not containing any material non-public information with respect to the Company, its Affiliates and its and their respective securities (" _Company MNPI_ "), (b) participating, upon reasonable prior notice, in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as bookrunners, lead arrangers, lead underwriters, lead initial purchasers or lead placement agents), presentations, road shows, and sessions with the rating agencies, (c) assisting in the preparation of any customary offering documents, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents, and (d) providing, to the extent required by the Financing Letter (or the similar agreements for any Alternative Financing or Bond Financing, as applicable), (i) audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the fiscal year of the Company most recently ended at least 90 days prior to the Closing Date and the immediately preceding fiscal year and (ii) unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for each quarterly period ended subsequent to the date of the most recent audited balance sheet delivered pursuant to clause (i) above and at least 45 days prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing: (A) the Company shall not be deemed to be in breach of its agreements set forth herein to cooperate in the arrangement and syndication of any such financing unless such failure would constitute a material breach of, or is the primary cause of the nonsatisfaction of any condition precedent to the availability of the financing under, the Financing Letter (or the similar agreements for any Alternative Financing or Bond Financing, as applicable); and (B) (i) no officer, director or employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to execute any documents, including any pledge or security documents or any other definitive financing documents, on behalf of the Company or otherwise, prior to the Effective Time, (ii) neither the Company nor any of the Company 

   ##### 

  

    

Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment fee or expenses or any
other amount in connection with the financing contemplated by the Financing
Letter, any Bond Financing or any Alternative Financing prior to
the Effective Time, and (iii) neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries shall be required to indemnify any person in connection with the
financing contemplated by the Financing Letter, any Bond Financing or any
Alternative Financing prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, promptly
upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation if and to the extent
such cooperation was specifically requested by Parent. Parent and the Merger
Subs shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, each of the Company Subsidiaries, and the Representatives of the
Company from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims,
costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the financing
contemplated by the Financing Letters, any Bond Financing and/or any
Alternative Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith,
except with respect to information provided by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries obtained by Parent or its
Representatives pursuant to this _Section 5.21_ shall be kept confidential
pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent and its
subsidiaries shall be permitted to disclose such information to the actual or
prospective financing sources (none of which shall be, or be affiliated with,
a competitor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) approached in
good faith in connection with the syndication of the Financing or the
underwriting, arrangement or syndication of any Bond Financing or any
Alternative Financing, subject to customary confidentiality undertakings by
such actual or prospective financing sources. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the covenants, obligations and agreements of
the Company in this _Section 5.21.2_ shall be the only covenants,
obligations or agreements by the Company relating to the Financing, any Bond
Financing or the Alternative Financing.

ARTICLE VII 
 Termination, Amendment and Waiver 

   

 Section 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Mergers contemplated hereby may be abandoned, at any time prior to the Effective Time, by action taken or authorized by the board of directors (or any committee thereof) of the terminating party or parties: 

    

 (i) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company; 

   

 (ii) by either the Company or Parent if the Mergers shall not have been consummated prior to May 31, 2010; _provided_ , that the Company or Parent may extend such date to June 30, 2010, by providing written notice to the other party prior to May 31, 2010, in the event all conditions to effect the Mergers other than those set forth in _Section 6.1.1_ (to the extent that the Order or ruling relates to a violation or alleged violation of Antitrust Laws) or _Section 6.1.2_ has been or is capable of being satisfied at the time of such extension (such date, as it may be so extended, the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(ii)_ shall not be available to any party whose breach of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Mergers to occur on or before the Outside Date; 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) by either the Company or Parent if any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority shall have issued an Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Mergers, and such Order shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the party terminating this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(iii)_ shall have used reasonable best efforts to resist, appeal, obtain consent under, resolve or lift, as applicable, the Order and shall have complied in all material respects with its obligations under _Section 5.12_; _provided further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(iii)_ shall not be available to any party whose breach of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, any such Order; 

   

 (iv) by Parent, if (a) any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall have become untrue or the Company has breached any covenant or agreement of the Company set forth in this Agreement, (b) such breach or misrepresentation is not capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date or has not been cured within 10 calendar days after the Companys receipt of written notice thereof from Parent, and (c) such breach or misrepresentation would cause any of the conditions set forth in  _Sections 6.2.1_, _6.2.2_ or _6.2.3_ not to be satisfied; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent or the Merger Subs are not also then in material breach of this Agreement; 

   

 (v) by the Company, if (a) (x) any representation or warranty of Parent or the Merger Subs set forth in this Agreement shall have become untrue, (y) such breach or misrepresentation is not capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date or has not been cured within 10 calendar days after Parents receipt of written notice thereof from the Company, and (z) such breach or misrepresentation would cause any of the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.3.1_, _6.3.2_ or _6.3.3_ not to be satisfied; or (b) (x) Parent or the Merger Subs have breached any covenant or agreement of Parent or the Merger Subs set forth in this Agreement, (y) such breach is not capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date or has not been cured within 10 calendar days after Parents receipt of written notice thereof from the Company, and (z) such breach would cause any of the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.3.1_,  _6.3.2_ or _6.3.3_ not to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that in either case the Company is not also then in material breach of this Agreement; and 

   

 (vi) by the Company if Parent does not effect the Closing within five Business Days after notice by the Company to Parent that the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ are satisfied and all such conditions have in fact been satisfied (or, upon an immediate Closing, are capable of being satisfied as of such Closing), unless the failure of any such conditions to be satisfied is, in substantial part, the result of a breach by Parent or the Merger Subs of their representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, in which case such conditions shall be deemed to be satisfied for purposes of this _Section 7.1(vi)_. 

  

 Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, the 

    ##### 

  

    

Merger Subs or the Company or their respective subsidiaries, officers or
directors except (a) with respect to  _Section 5.9.2_, _Section 5.14_, this
_Section 7.2_, _Article X_ and the second, third and fourth sentences of
_Section 5.21.2_, which shall survive termination, and (b) subject to
_Section 7.2.1_, with respect to any liabilities or damages incurred
or suffered by a party (including, in the case of a claim by the Company,
damages based on the consideration payable to the Participating Holders) as a
result of the willful and material breach by the other party of this
Agreement. 

   

 Section 7.2.1 _Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement_. 

    

 Section 7.2.1.1 In the event that the Company shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(v)(b)_ or _Section 7.1(vi)_, or the Company or Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(ii)_ at a time when this Agreement could have been terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(v)(b)_ or  _Section 7.1(vi)_, then Parent shall pay to the Company a termination fee of $25,625,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "). 

   

 Section 7.2.1.2 The Termination Fee to be paid in accordance with _Section 7.2.1.1_ shall be paid not later than the second Business Day after the date that this Agreement is terminated, payable by wire transfer of same day funds to an account specified by the Company. If paid, the Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company against Parent and the Merger Subs for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement by Parent or the Merger Subs and the failure of the Mergers to be consummated and, upon payment of the Termination Fee in accordance with this _Section 7.2.1_ , neither Parent nor either of the Merger Subs shall have further liability or obligation to the Company relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except that Parent and the Merger Subs shall also be obligated with respect to _Section 5.9.2_, _Section 5.14_, _Section 5.21.2_ and _Article X_). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be obligated to pay, or cause to be paid, more than one Termination Fee. 

   

 Section 7.2.1.3 Parent, the Merger Subs and the Company acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section 7.2.1_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that the Termination Fee constitutes liquidated damages and not a penalty, and that, without these agreements, Parent, the Merger Subs and the Company would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if a party fails to promptly pay any amount due by such party pursuant to this _Section 7.2.1_ (the " _Defaulting Party_ "), and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Defaulting Party for the fees set forth in this  _Section 7.2.1_ or any portion of such fees, the Defaulting Party shall pay to the other party its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fees at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made from the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment. 

  

 Section 7.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to 

    ##### 

  

    

the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after receipt of the
Company Shareholder Written Consent, no amendment may be made without further
stockholder approval which by Law requires further approval by such
stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by the parties hereto. 

   

 Section 7.4 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Merger Subs, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance by the other with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. 

   

ARTICLE VIII 
 Indemnification and Third Party Claims 

   

 Section 8.1 _Indemnification of Parent_. From and after the Effective Time, each of the Participating Holders (together, the " _Company Indemnifying Party_ "), by approval of this Agreement and the Mergers by the Required Company Shareholders, pursuant to the Letter of Transmittal or pursuant to the acknowledgments of appointment executed by the SAR Holders and the RSU Holders before or after the date of this Agreement (the " _Acknowledgments_ "), hereby agrees to severally, but not jointly, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent and its directors, officers, employees and controlled and controlling persons and each of their representatives (hereinafter, collectively, " _related persons_ "), from and against all Claims asserted against, imposed upon or incurred by Parent or its related persons (a " _Parent Indemnified Person_ "), to the extent resulting from: (a) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement, or (b) the breach of any covenant of the Company contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement. Each Participating Holders indemnification obligations hereunder (including pursuant to _Section 8.5_) with respect to any Damages shall equal, and in no event exceed, the percentage of such Damages obtained by multiplying such Damages by (i) the amount of the total merger consideration such Participating Holder has actually received pursuant to _Section 2.1_, _Section 2.3_ and _Section 2.4_ , divided by (ii) the Total Merger Consideration (a Participating Holders " _Percentage Share_ "). 

   

 Section 8.2 _Indemnification of Participating Holders_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent (the " _Parent Indemnifying Party_ ," and, together with the Company Indemnifying Party, the " _Indemnifying Parties_ " and each an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") hereby agree to jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Participating Holders and their related persons from and against all Claims asserted against, imposed upon or incurred by a Participating Holder or its related persons (a " _Company Indemnified Person_ ," and, together with the Parent Indemnified Persons, the " _Indemnified Persons_ " and each an " _Indemnified Person_ "), to the extent resulting from: (a) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of the Parent Indemnifying Party contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement, or (b) the breach of any covenant of the Parent Indemnifying Party contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 Section 8.3 _Damages_. As used in this _Article VIII_, the term " _Damages_ " shall include: (a) all debts, liabilities and obligations; (b) all losses, damages, costs and expenses, including pre- and post-judgment interest, penalties, disgorgement of profit, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses; and (c) all demands, claims, actions, costs of investigation, causes of action, proceedings, arbitrations, judgments, settlements and assessments, whether or not ultimately determined to be valid; _provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, "Damages" shall not include, and no Indemnifying Party shall be liable to or required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Indemnified Person for, any Damages (i) related to any matter that was taken into account in the final determination of Closing Cash, Net Working Capital or Closing Date Indebtedness pursuant to _Section 2.6_ , (ii) relating to any matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the extent that the Indemnified Person has already recovered Damages with respect to such matter pursuant to another provision of this Agreement, (iii) resulting from or arising out of actions taken by the Indemnified Person or its related persons, (iv) that are punitive, special, consequential, or exemplary or otherwise not actual damages, in the nature of lost profits, or any diminution in value of property or equity (except to the extent any such damages are asserted by a third party unaffiliated with the Indemnified Person), or (v) calculated using "multiple of profits," "multiple of cash flow" or any similar valuation methodology (except to the extent any such damages are asserted by a third party unaffiliated with the Indemnified Person). For the avoidance of doubt, it is the intent of the parties that the terms "special" and "consequential" damages in this  _Section 8.3_ shall not include any Damages that an Indemnified Person may naturally or usually suffer or sustain as a result of or in connection with any event set forth in _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.2_, as applicable; _provided_ that such terms shall include all Damages attributable to special circumstances of the Indemnified Person or its related persons and all Damages that are not reasonably foreseeable by the Indemnifying Person as of the date of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 8.4 _Defense of Third Party Indemnification Claims_. Promptly after receiving notice of any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation, demand or other claim for Damages against an Indemnified Person (if by a third-party), the Indemnified Person shall notify in writing the Indemnifying Party of such indemnification claim, describing such claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof in reasonable detail (an " _Indemnification Claim_ "). If the Indemnified Person does not so notify the Indemnifying Party within 15 days after becoming aware of such Indemnification Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall, if such delay materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party with respect to the defense of such Indemnification Claim, be relieved of liability hereunder in respect of such Indemnification Claim to the extent of the damage caused by such delay. In any such proceeding, following receipt of notice properly given, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, at its sole discretion, to assume the entire defense of such Indemnification Claim (with counsel selected by it which is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person or Persons), and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the entire cost of defending such Indemnification Claim. If the Indemnifying Party shall control the defense of any such Indemnification Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to settle such claims; _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) before entering into any settlement of such Indemnification Claim or ceasing to defend such Indemnification Claim if, pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against the Indemnified Person or 

    ##### 

  

    

if such settlement does not expressly and unconditionally release the
Indemnified Person from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such
Indemnification Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any amount required to be paid by
the Indemnified Person that exceeds, where the Indemnified Person has
unreasonably withheld or delayed consent in connection with the proposed
compromise or settlement of an Indemnification Claim, the amount for which
such Indemnification Claim could have been settled pursuant to that proposed
compromise or settlement. In the event of the assumption of the defense by
the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
further legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified
Persons in connection with such defense unless otherwise agreed to in writing
by the Indemnifying Party or as herein provided; _provided_ , _however_ , the
Indemnified Persons shall have the right to participate in such defense, at
their own cost, and the obligation to cooperate therewith. In all cases,
the Indemnified Person shall provide its reasonable cooperation with the
Indemnifying Party in defense of claims or litigation, including by making
employees, information and documentation reasonably available. If the
Indemnifying Party shall not assume the defense of any Indemnification
Claim, the Indemnified Person may defend against such matter as it deems
appropriate; _provided_ that the Indemnified Person may not settle any such

 Section 8.5 _Tax Indemnification_. 

    

 Section 8.5.1 From and after the Effective Time, the Participating Holders, severally, and not jointly, each in accordance with its respective Percentage Share, shall indemnify Parent and Parents affiliates and hold them harmless from and against (without duplication) any Damages attributable to any and all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for the Pre-Closing Tax Period except to the extent such Taxes are reflected in the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) shown on the face of the Closing Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes thereto) and taken into account in determining the Final Adjustment Amount. If the total amount of all Damages under this  _Section 8.5.1_ does not exceed $100,000, then the Participating Holders shall have no obligation with respect to any such Damages. With respect to any taxable period that includes but does not end on the Closing Date, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis, the portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall (a) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire period _multiplied_ by a fraction (i) the numerator of which is the number of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and (ii) the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire period, and (b) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant period ended on the Closing Date. 

   

 Section 8.5.2 From and after the Effective Time, the Parent Indemnifying Party shall indemnify the Participating Holders and their affiliates and hold them harmless from and against (without duplication) any Damages attributable to any and

the Pre-Closing Tax Period except to the extent such Taxes are reflected in
the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes
established to reflecting timing differences between book and Tax income)
shown on the face of the most recent balance sheet (rather than in any notes
thereto) in the Parent Financial Statements and adjusted for the passage of
time through the Closing Date in accordance with past custom and practice of
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns. If the total
amount of all Indemnification Claims under this _Section 8.5.2_ does not
exceed $100,000, then the Parent Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation
with respect to any such Indemnification Claim. With respect to any taxable
period that includes but does not end on the Closing Date, in the case of any
Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis, the portion of such Tax that
relates to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing
Date shall (a) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or
related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire period _multiplied_ by a fraction (i) the numerator of which is the
number of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and (ii) the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire period, and (b)
in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed
equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant period ended on
the Closing Date.

 Section 8.6.3 The obligations of the Company Indemnifying Party under this _Article VIII_ shall be limited to an aggregate maximum amount equal to $55,000,000. 

   ##### 

  

   

 Section 8.6.4 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Damages which are subject to indemnification hereunder shall be calculated net of (a) any reduction in Tax liability or any increase in Tax attributes of the Indemnified Person or any of its affiliates (including the Surviving Company and its subsidiaries) and (b) any insurance proceeds or other amounts under indemnification agreements received or receivable by the Indemnified Person on account of such Damages. The Indemnified Persons shall seek full recovery under all insurance policies and/or indemnification agreements covering any Damages to the same extent as they would if such Damages were not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made by any Indemnified Person with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery shall be made promptly to the Person or Persons that provided such indemnity payments to such Indemnified Person. The Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Person in respect of any Losses indemnified by the Indemnifying Party. 

   

 Section 8.6.5 Parent may offset any amount due and payable from the Participating Holders pursuant to this _Article VIII_ against any unpaid Earnout Payment.

 Section 8.8 _Survival_. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made in this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered in connection herewith shall be in full force and effect and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and shall survive the Closing and continue to be applicable and binding thereafter for the period set forth in _Section 8.6.1_, at which time such representations and obligations under this _Article VIII_ shall terminate and be extinguished, except with respect to any item as to which an Indemnified Person shall have, prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period, previously made a claim by delivering a written notice (stating in reasonable detail the nature of, and factual and legal basis for, any such claim for indemnification, and the provisions of this Agreement upon which such claim for indemnification is made) to the Indemnifying Party. Except as expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, no claim for indemnification hereunder may be made after the expiration of the period set forth in _Section 8.6.1_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any covenants of any party which by their terms are to be performed or observed on or following the Closing shall survive the Closing until fully performed or observed in accordance with their terms.

Should the Seller Representative resign or be unable to serve, the Seller Representative shall appoint a single substitute agent to take on the responsibility of the Seller Representative hereunder, whose appointment shall be effective on the date of the Seller Representatives resignation or incapacity. 

   

 Section 9.2 _Authority_. By approval of this Agreement and the Mergers by the Required Company Shareholders, pursuant to the Letter of Transmittal, and pursuant to the Acknowledgments, each Participating Holder hereby irrevocably appoints the Seller Representative as the agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for such Participating Holder for all purposes of this Agreement (including the full power and authority on such Participating Holders behalf) to (i) consummate the transactions contemplated herein and any post-Closing matters; (ii) pay such Participating Holders expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and performance of this Agreement (whether incurred on or after the date of this Agreement); (iii) disburse any funds received hereunder to such Participating Holder and each other Participating Holder; (iv) endorse and deliver any certificates or instruments representing shares of Company Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock and execute such further instruments of assignment as Parent shall reasonably request; (v) execute and deliver on behalf of such Participating Holder any amendment or waiver in connection with this Agreement and the other agreements or documents contemplated hereby as the Seller Representative, in its sole discretion, may deem necessary or desirable; (vi) execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Escrow Agreement (with such modifications or changes therein as to which the Seller Representative, in its sole discretion, shall have consented) and to agree to and enter into any such amendments or modifications thereto as the Seller Representative, in its sole discretion, determines to be desirable; (vii) take all other actions to be taken by or on behalf of such Participating Holder in connection herewith; (viii) do each and every act and exercise any and all rights which such Participating Holder individually or collectively are permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement; and (ix) make, execute, acknowledge and deliver this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and all such other agreements, guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions, certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do any and all things and to take any and all action that the Seller Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and all other agreements and documents referred to herein or therein or executed in connection herewith and therewith, including, without limitation, retaining counsel, 

    ##### 

  

    

accountants and other experts, incurring fees and expenses, asserting or
pursuing any claim, action, proceeding or investigation (a " _Claim_
") against Parent, the Merger Subs, the Surviving Company and/or any
Participating Holder, defending any Claims by an Indemnified Person or third-
party claims pursuant to _Article VIII_, consenting to, compromising or
settling any such Claims, and conducting negotiations with Parent and its
Representatives regarding such Claims, it being understood that the Seller
Representative shall not have any obligation to take any such actions, and
shall not have any liability for any failure to take any such actions. Each
Participating Holder agrees that such agency and proxy are coupled with an
interest, are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the
Seller Representative and shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy,
dissolution or liquidation of any Participating Holder. All decisions and
actions by the Seller Representative (to the extent authorized by this
Agreement) shall be binding upon all Participating Holders, and no
Participating Holder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same; _provided, however_ , that the Seller
Representative shall not take any such action where (x) any
single Participating Holder would be held solely liable for any losses, out-
of-pocket costs or expenses, liabilities or other damages (without such
Participating Holders consent) or (y) such action materially and adversely
affects the substantive rights or obligations of one Participating Holder, or
group of Participating Holders, without a similar proportionate effect upon
the substantive rights or obligations of all Participating Holders, unless
each such disproportionately affected Participating Holder consents in
writing thereto. 

   

 Section 9.3 _Authority; Indemnification_. Each Participating Holder agrees that Parent shall be entitled to rely on any action taken by the Seller Representative on behalf of such Participating Holder pursuant to _Section 9.2_ (an " _Authorized Action_ "), and that each Authorized Action shall be binding on each Participating Holder as fully as if such Participating Holder had taken such Authorized Action. Parent agrees that the Seller Representative, as the Seller Representative, shall have no liability to Parent for any Authorized Action, except to the extent that such Authorized Action is found by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction to have constituted fraud or willful misconduct. Each Participating Holder hereby severally, for itself only and not jointly and severally, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Representative against all expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Seller Representative in connection with any action, suit or proceeding to which the Seller Representative is made a party by reason of the fact it is or was acting as the Seller Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and any expenses incurred by the Seller Representative in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder. 

   

 Section 9.4 _Expense Funds_. The Seller Representative shall not be entitled to any fee, commission or other compensation for the performance of its services hereunder, but shall be entitled to the payment of all expenses incurred as the Seller Representative. In connection with the foregoing, on or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver $400,000 (the " _Expense Funds_ ") (which amount, to the extent not delivered prior to the Closing Date, shall either be treated as a Company Transaction Expense or shall reduce Closing Cash) to the Seller Representative to be used by the Seller Representative to pay any expenses incurred by the Seller Representative in its capacity as the Seller Representative, including any attorneys, accountants and other experts fees. Once the Seller Representative determines, in its sole discretion, that the Seller Representative will not incur any additional expenses in its capacity as 

    ##### 

  

    

Seller Representative, then the Seller Representative will distribute to the
Participating Holders their Percentage Share of the remaining unused Expense
Funds, if any, without interest; _provided_ , that the Seller Representative
shall not be required to return any amount to any Participating Holder if the
amount such Participating Holder would otherwise receive would be less than
$100. 

   

 Section 9.5 _Exculpation_. The Seller Representative shall not have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Participating Holder, except in respect of amounts received on behalf of such Participating Holder. The Seller Representative shall not be liable to any Participating Holder for any action taken or omitted by it or any agent employed by it hereunder or under any other document entered into in connection herewith, except that the Seller Representative shall not be relieved of any liability imposed by Law for fraud or willful misconduct. The Seller Representative shall not be liable to any Participating Holder for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by the Seller Representative in good faith, and if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of any Participating Holder to whom payment was due, but not made, shall be to recover from other Participating Holders any payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined to have been entitled. The Seller Representative shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement. Neither the Seller Representative nor any agent employed by it shall incur any liability to any Participating Holder by virtue of the failure or refusal of the Seller Representative for any reason to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or relating to the performance of its other duties hereunder, except for actions or omissions constituting fraud or bad faith. 

   

 Section 9.6 _Survival_. All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the Seller Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date and/or any termination of this Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement.

 Section 10.4 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, a Section, or an Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article of, a Section of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. Whenever required by the context, any pronoun used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns, pronouns and verbs shall include the plural and vice versa. The words "include" and "including," and other words of similar import when used herein shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation but rather shall be deemed to be followed in each case by the words "without limitation." The word "if" and other words of similar import when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the phrase "and only if." The words "herein," "hereto," and "hereby" and other words of similar import in this Agreement shall be deemed in each case to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Article, Section or other subdivision of this Agreement. Any reference herein to "dollars" or "$" shall mean United States dollars. The words "as of the date of this Agreement" and words of similar import shall be deemed in each case to refer to the date of this Agreement as set forth in the Preamble hereto. 

   

 Section 10.5 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 10.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other 

    ##### 

  

    

provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible. 

   

 Section 10.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, Parent Disclosure Schedule, Company Disclosure Schedule and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto), and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior agreements, representations and undertakings, both written and oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

   

 Section 10.8 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise and any purported assignment hereof shall be null and void. 

   

 Section 10.9 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement other than (a) the rights of the Seller Representative set forth in this Agreement, (b) as specifically provided in _Article II_ and _Section 5.16_; (c) the rights of the Companys shareholders to pursue claims for damages (including claims for damages based on loss of the economic benefits of the transaction to the Companys shareholders and the SAR Holders and RSU Holders) and other relief, including equitable relief for Parents or the Merger Subs material breach, wrongful repudiation or termination of this Agreement or fraud; (d) after the Effective Time, the rights of the Participating Holders to receive the consideration specified in _Article II_ ; and (e) after the Effective Time, the rights of the Participating Holders pursuant to  _Article VIII_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the rights granted pursuant to clause (c) shall only be enforceable on behalf of the Companys shareholders and the holders of Company SARS and Restricted Stock Units by the Company or the Seller Representative in its sole and absolute discretion. 

   

 Section 10.10 _Mutual Drafting_. Each party hereto has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties. 

   

 Section 10.11 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_. 

    

 Section 10.11.1 This Agreement, and all claims and causes of action arising out of, based upon, or related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be governed by, and construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with, the internal Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to Laws that may be applicable under conflicts of laws principles. 

   

 Section 10.11.2 Each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (or if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware), and any appellate court 

   ##### 

  

    

therefrom, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement
of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (a) agrees that any claim in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in the Delaware Court
of Chancery (or if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court sitting in
the State of Delaware), (b) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally
and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the Delaware Court of
Chancery (or if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court sitting in
the State of Delaware), and (c) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action
or proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery (or if the Delaware Court of
Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state
or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware). Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in _Section 10.2_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any
party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by
Law. 

   

 Section 10.11.3 EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. 

  

 Section 10.12 _Disclosure_. Each party hereto has or may have set forth information in its respective Disclosure Schedule in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one section of the Disclosure Schedule need not be set forth in any other section of the Disclosure Schedule so long as its relevance to the latter section of the Disclosure Schedule or section of the Agreement is reasonably apparent on the face of the information disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in a Disclosure Schedule to this Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Such information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material", "Company Material Adverse Effect," "Parent Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement. 

   

 Section 10.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
