   9.17 | The Sellers shall not be liable in respect of a Non-Tax Claim to
the extent that the Claim arises or is increased as a result of:

     | 9.17.1 | a change in law, administrative practice or published
interpretation of the law, after the Completion Date; 
---|---|--- 



     | 9.17.2 | any change in generally accepted accounting practice

50% of the cost of obtaining the Warranty Insurance on this basis, provided
that the Purchaser shall not be required to pay any sum in excess of £200,000
and the Sellers shall pay any remaining balance if such cap is exceeded. If

Sums recoverable from third parties



   9.21 | Where the Purchaser, or any Group Company (or any assignee or
successor in title thereof) is entitled to recover from any third party any
sum in respect of any matter or event which is likely to give rise to a Non-

shall, use all reasonable endeavours to recover that sum and before any steps
are taken against the Sellers under this Agreement in respect of such Claim
(other than service of notice of such Claim on the Sellers pursuant to
clauses 9.2 and 9.5). The Purchaser shall keep the Sellers Representative at
all times fully and promptly informed of the conduct of such recovery. Any sum
actually recovered by the Purchaser, or any Group Company (less any
reasonable costs, charges and expenses incurred by the Purchaser or any Group
Company in recovering the sum and any tax attributable to or suffered in
respect of the sum recovered) will reduce the amount of the Claim by an
equivalent amount. 
---|--- 



   9.22 | If recovery from the third party is delayed until after the
Claim has been satisfied by the Sellers, the Purchaser shall repay to the
Sellers the amount so recovered (less any reasonable costs, charges or

the Purchaser.

---|--- 



     | 9.23.1 | the Purchaser shall as soon as reasonably practicable,
notify the Sellers Representative giving reasonable details of the relevant
facts and circumstances relating to the Third Party Claim which are known to
the Purchaser; and 
---|---|--- 



     | 9.23.2 | the Purchaser shall, and shall procure that the relevant
Group Company shall, keep the Sellers Representative informed of all material
developments in relation to the Third Party Claim and, not settle or make
any admission of liability, agreement or compromise any claim or matter
relating to the Third Party Claim without written consent of the Sellers
Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
subject to the Sellers indemnifying the Purchaser in respect of all costs,
charges and expenses that are reasonably and properly incurred by the
Purchaser (or any other member of the Group) as a consequence of any such
actions taken or not taken at the request of the Sellers Representative. The
Purchaser may reasonably request security from the Sellers in support of any
indemnity and the Purchaser shall have no obligation under this clause 9.21.2,
if such security is not provided within 10 Business Days of such request. 
---|---|--- 

Mitigation



   9.24 |

Nothing in this clause 9 restricts or limits the general obligation at law of

damages or obtain payment, reimbursement, restitution or indemnity more than

recovery by the relevant Group Company shall be deemed to be recovery by the
Purchaser. 
---|--- 
 

Indirect and consequential loss



   9.27 | Other than in respect of a Tax Schedule Claim, the Sellers shall
not be liable to the Purchaser for any: 
---|--- 



     | 9.27.1 | loss which does not naturally arise from a breach of this
Agreement; or 
---|---|--- 



     | 9.27.2 | punitive damages (whether direct or indirect). 
---|---|--- 

Change of control

 



   9.28 | The Sellers shall not be liable for any Claim arising from any

Completion. 
---|--- 

Withdrawal and settlement of Claims

 



   9.29 | If the Purchaser withdraws a Claim against any of the Sellers,
the Purchaser shall also withdraw that Claim against each of the other
Sellers. 
---|--- 
 



   9.30 | If the Purchaser settles a Claim against a Seller the Purchaser
shall offer to the other Sellers settlement terms which are, so far as
practicable, the same (having regard to the percentage of each Claim to be
borne by and the aggregate liability of such Seller) as those agreed with
that Seller with whom the Purchaser has settled. 
---|--- 
 

General



   9.31 | The limitations on the liability of the Sellers set out in this

Tax Warranties and not previously refunded under this sub-clause 8.3.2 up to
the amount of such excess; and 
---|---|--- 



     | 8.3.3 | third, to the extent that the excess referred to in sub-
clause 8.3.2 is not exhausted under that sub-clause, the remainder of that
excess shall be carried forward and set off against any future payments which

---|---|--- 



   8.4 | If so requested by the Sellers and at the Sellers expense, the
Purchaser shall request the auditors for the time being of a Group Company to
certify the amount of any overprovision as referred to in paragraph 8.1 or

---|--- 



   8.5 | Where the Sellers disagree with the amount certified in
accordance with paragraph 8.4 as being the amount of such overprovision or
reduction or extinction of any Tax Liability and notify the Purchaser of
such disagreement, the matter shall be determined at the Sellers expense by
an independent firm of internationally recognised accountants (who shall act
as experts and not as arbitrators and whose determination shall, in the
absence of manifest error, be final and binding) to be agreed between
Purchaser and Sellers or, failing agreement within fourteen (14) Business
Days, to be nominated, upon the request of either the Purchaser or Sellers, by

discharge Tax for which they are liable. 
---|--- 
 



   9.2 | The covenant contained in paragraph 9.1 shall extend to any
reasonable costs incurred by the Seller in connection with any Tax Liability

procure that no such recovery is sought to the extent that payment is made
hereunder); or 
---|---|--- 



     | 9.4.2 | the Purchaser is entitled to payment from the Sellers
under paragraph 2.1 in respect of the liability and the Sellers have not
previously made that payment. 
---|---|---
