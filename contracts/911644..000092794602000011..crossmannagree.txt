                                   WITNESSETH:

     WHEREAS,  the respective Boards of Directors of Parent,  Merger Sub and the

conditions  set forth in this  Agreement,  whereby  each issued and  outstanding
share (a  "Company  Share")  of  common  stock,  no par  value,  of the  Company

stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (the "Parent Common Stock") and cash
subject to the provisions of Article II of this Agreement;

     WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to qualify
as a tax-free  reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the United
States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code");

     WHEREAS,  Parent,  Merger  Sub  and the  Company  desire  to  make  certain

     SECTION 2.3 Conversion of Company Common Stock.

Election"),  the  right  to  receive  in  cash  an  amount  equal  to  the  Base
Consideration  Value. Company Shares for which a Cash Election has been made are

     product of (A) the Adjusted Cash Amount times (B) the  aggregate  number of
     Non-Election  Shares,  divided by (z) the aggregate number of Cash Election
     Shares, but in no event less than the Adjusted Cash Amount.

          (ii) A  fraction  of a share  of  Parent  Common  Stock  equal  to the
     quotient  of (y) the  Base  Consideration  Value  minus  the  cash  payable

          (iii) The term "Requested  Cash Amount" means the aggregate  amount of
     cash that would be payable  with  respect to  Non-Election  Shares and Cash
     Election Shares before any  adjustments  pursuant to Section 2.3(e) or this

          (iv) The term "Cash  Consideration"  means the product of the Adjusted
     Cash  Amount  times the number of Company  Shares  outstanding  immediately
     prior to the  Effective  Time  (other  than  shares  cancelled  pursuant to
     Section 2.2).

     (e) If the Requested Cash Amount is less than the Cash  Consideration,  the
Merger  Consideration  for each Stock  Election  Share  shall be cash and Parent
Common Stock as set forth below:

          (i) Cash equal to the quotient of (y) the Cash Consideration minus the
     Requested Cash Amount, divided by (z) the number of Stock Election Shares.

          (ii) A  fraction  of a share  of  Parent  Common  Stock  equal  to the
     quotient  of (y) the  Base  Consideration  Value  minus  the  cash  payable
     pursuant to Section 2.3(e)(i), divided by (z) the Stock Value.

     (f) Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  if more than 60% of the total value of
the Merger  Consideration  for all the  outstanding  Company  Shares  other than
shares to be canceled in  accordance  with  Section 2.2 would be cash,  the cash
which a holder of a share of Company  Common  Stock will receive will be reduced
on a pro rata basis with all other such  holders to the amount  such that 60% of
the total  value of the  Merger  Consideration  will be cash and the  holders of
Company  Common  Stock will  receive in exchange  for such  reduction in cash an
amount of  additional  shares of Parent  Common  Stock  obtained by dividing the
amount of such reduction in cash by the Stock Value.

     (g) Each person who, on or prior to the Election  Date,  is a record holder
of shares of Company  Shares  shall have the right to submit a Form of  Election
specifying one of the following:  (i) that such stockholder  desires that all of
his or her  Company  Shares  be  converted  into  the Base  Consideration  (such
election being hereinafter  sometimes  referred to as a "Base  Election"),  (ii)
that such stockholder desires that all of his or her Company Shares be converted
into cash pursuant to the Cash Election,  or (iii) that such stockholder desires
that all of his or her Company Shares be converted  into Stock  Election  Shares
pursuant to the Stock Election.  A stockholder may not make an election for less
than all of his or her Company Shares.

     (h)  Parent  shall  prepare,  subject  to the  reasonable  approval  of the
Company,  a form of election (the "Form of Election") for mailing with the Proxy
Statement.  The Form of  Election  shall be (i) mailed to the record  holders of
Company Shares as of the record date for the Company  Stockholder  Meeting,  and
(ii) used by each record holder of Company Shares to make the Base Election, the
Cash Election or the Stock  Election.  The Company shall also use its reasonable
best efforts to make the Form of Election and the Proxy  Statement  available to
all persons who become  holders of Company Shares during the period between such
record  date and the  Election  Date.  Any such  holder's  Base  Election,  Cash
Election or Stock  Election  shall have been  properly made only if the Exchange
Agent shall have received at its designated  office, by 5:00 p.m., New York City


                                     - 6 -

time on the  business  day next  preceding  the date of the Company  Stockholder
Meeting (the "Election Date"), a Form of Election properly  completed and signed
and accompanied by certificate(s) for the Company Shares  ("Certificate(s)")  to
which such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form
acceptable  for  transfer  on the  books of the  Company  (or by an  appropriate
guarantee  for  delivery  of such  Certificate(s)  as set  forth in such Form of
Election  from a firm  which is a member  of a  registered  national  securities
exchange or a commercial bank or trust company having an office or correspondent
in the United States, provided that such Certificate(s) are in fact delivered to
the Exchange Agent within three trading days after the date of execution of such
guarantee of delivery).

     (i) Any Form of  Election  may be  revoked  by a record  holder of  Company
Common Stock who submitted  such Form of Election to the Exchange  Agent only by
written notice  received by the Exchange Agent prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City
time  on  the  Election   Date.  In  addition,   all  Forms  of  Election  shall
automatically  be revoked if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Parent
and the Company that the Merger has been abandoned or if either the Company's or
Parent's  stockholders  fail to approve  the  Merger.  If a Form of  Election is
revoked  because the Merger has been  abandoned  or if either the  Company's  or
Parent's  stockholders  fail to  approve  the  Merger,  the  Certificate(s)  (or
guarantee(s)  of delivery,  if  applicable)  for the share(s) of Company  Common
Stock, if any, to which such Form of Election relates shall promptly be returned
to the stockholder submitting the same to the Exchange Agent.

     (j) For purposes of this  Agreement,  a holder of Common Stock who does not
submit a Form of Election  which is received by the Exchange  Agent prior to the
Election Date or who submits a Form of Election that is not properly made or who
acquires  Company Shares after the date hereof pursuant to either of the Company
Option  Plans  shall be  deemed to have  made a  Non-Election.  If Parent or the
Exchange Agent shall  determine that any purported Base Election,  Cash Election
or Stock  Election was not properly made,  such  purported  Base Election,  Cash
Election or Stock  Election shall be deemed to be of no force and effect and the
holder making such  purported  Base  Election,  Cash Election or Stock  Election
shall,  for purposes of this  Agreement,  be deemed to have made a Non-Election.
All holders of Non-Election Shares shall receive the Base Consideration.

     (k) Parent shall have the sole  discretion,  which it may delegate in whole
or in part to the Exchange  Agent,  to determine  whether Forms of Election have
been  properly  completed,  signed and  submitted  or revoked  and to  disregard
immaterial defects in Forms of Election. The decision of Parent (or the Exchange
Agent,  if applicable) in such matters shall be conclusive and binding.  Neither
Parent  nor the  Exchange  Agent  shall be under any  obligation  to notify  any
stockholder of any defect in a Form of Election submitted to the Exchange Agent.
The Exchange Agent shall make all  computations  contemplated  by Section 2.3(d)
and Section 2.3(e) and all such computations  shall be conclusive and binding on
the holders of Company Common Stock.

     SECTION 2.4  Cancellation  of Company Shares.  Upon conversion  pursuant to
Section 2.3, all Company Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist,  and each
holder  thereof  shall cease to have any rights with respect  thereto other than
the  right  to  receive  the  Merger  Consideration  and any  other  amounts  in
accordance  with the terms  provided  herein.  All shares of Parent Common Stock
issued as Merger  Consideration  shall be fully paid and nonassessable.

     SECTION 2.5 Stock Options.  At the Effective Time, each option  outstanding
(and  which by its  terms  does not lapse on or before  the  Effective  Time) to
purchase  Company  Common Stock (a "Company  Stock  Option")  granted  under the
Company's  1993 Employee  Stock Option Plan,  as amended (the "Company  Employee
Option  Plan"),  or the Company's  1993 Outside  Director Stock Option Plan (the
"Company Director Plan" and, together with the Company Employee Option Plan, the
"Company  Option Plans"),  whether or not then vested or  exercisable,  shall be
replaced by a comparable option to purchase Parent Common Stock (a "Parent Stock
Option"),  after giving effect to the  requirements  of the Company Option Plans
(including without limitation any provisions with respect to a change of control
of the Company)  pursuant to which it was granted and any stock option agreement
by which it is evidenced.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  in the event that, as
of the Effective  Time,  Parent shall not have  reserved a sufficient  number of
shares  for  issuance  upon  exercise  of  each  of  the  Parent  Stock  Options
contemplated  by this Section 2.5, then, to the extent of such deficiency and on
a pro rata basis,  each holder of a Company  Stock  Option  (whether or not then
vested or exercisable)  shall be entitled to receive,  immediately  prior to the
Effective Time,  cash in an amount equal to the difference  between (A) the Base
Consideration  Value minus (B) the per-share  exercise  price of the  applicable
Company Stock Option.  It is intended  that the  foregoing  provisions  shall be
undertaken in a manner that will not constitute a  "modification"  as defined in
Section  424 of the Code as to any stock  option  which is an  "incentive  stock
option." Each Parent Stock Option shall be exercisable for that number of shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of the Company  Shares subject to the
corresponding  Company Stock Option  multiplied by the Stock Exchange Ratio, and
shall have an exercise  price per share equal to its exercise  price per Company
Share divided by the Stock  Exchange Ratio (the "Adjusted  Strike  Price").  Any
resulting  fractional  share of Parent Common Stock shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole share and Parent shall pay an amount in cash to the holder of such
Company  Stock  Option  at the  Effective  Time  equal  to the  product  of such
fractional  share of Parent  Common Stock  multiplied  by an amount equal to the
Stock Value minus the Adjusted  Strike  Price.  Parent and the Company shall use
commercially  reasonable  efforts to take all such steps as may be  required  to
cause  the  transactions   contemplated  by  this  Section  2.5  and  any  other
dispositions  of equity  securities  of the  Company or  dispositions  of Parent
equity  securities in connection  with this Agreement by each individual who (i)
is a director  or officer of the  Company or (ii) at the  Effective  Time,  will
become a director  or officer  of Parent,  to be exempt  under Rule 16b-3 of the
Exchange Act.

     SECTION  2.6  Adjustment  of Exchange  Ratio.  If after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective  Time there shall have been a change in the Parent Common
Stock,  by reason of a stock  split  (including  a reverse  split) of the Parent
Common  Stock or a dividend  payable in the Parent  Common  Stock,  or any other
distribution of securities to holders of the Parent Common Stock with respect to
their Parent Common Stock (including without limitation such a distribution made
in connection with a recapitalization,  reclassification, merger, consolidation,
reorganization or similar transaction) or otherwise, then the Exchange Ratio and
the dollar amounts set forth in Section 2.3(a) shall be appropriately  adjusted;
provided,  however,  that the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration shall not
be adjusted below the amount provided for in this Article II.

     SECTION 2.7 Exchange of Certificates.

     (a) Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement, Parent shall enter into an
agreement  with a bank or trust  company  designated  by Parent  (the  "Exchange
Agent"),  providing  that Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent as of the
Effective  Time,  for the  benefit of the  holders of the  Company  Shares,  for
exchange in  accordance  with  Sections 2.3 and 2.4 and this Section 2.7 through
the Exchange Agent,  (i) cash in an amount equal to the aggregate amount payable
pursuant to Sections 2.3 and 2.5, (ii)  certificates  representing the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable  pursuant to Sections 2.3 and 2.5 and (iii) cash in
an  amount  equal  to the  aggregate  amount  required  to be  paid  in  lieu of
fractional  interests of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.10 (such cash
and shares of Parent Common Stock,  together with any dividends or distributions
with respect  thereto with a record date after the  Effective  Time and the cash
referred to in clause (iii) of this Section 2.7 being hereinafter referred to as
the  "Exchange  Fund").  The  Exchange  Agent  shall,  pursuant  to  irrevocable
instructions,  deliver the cash and the Parent Common Stock  contemplated  to be
issued  pursuant to this Article II from the Exchange  Fund in  accordance  with
this Agreement.  Until they are  distributed,  the shares of Parent Common Stock
held by the Exchange Agent shall be deemed to be  outstanding,  but the Exchange
Agent shall not vote such shares or exercise  any rights of a  stockholder  with
regard thereto.

     (b) As soon as  practicable  after the Effective  Time,  the Exchange Agent
shall  mail to each  holder of record of a  certificate  representing  shares of
Company  Common Stock (a  "Certificate")  whose shares were  converted  into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration,  (i) a letter of transmittal and (ii)
instructions  for  use in  effecting  the  surrender  of the  Certificate(s)  in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of such Certificate(s) for
cancellation  to the Exchange  Agent,  together with such letter of transmittal,
duly  executed,  and such other  documents as may  reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such  Certificate(s)  shall be entitled to receive
in exchange  therefor a certificate  representing that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash which such holder has the right to receive pursuant
to  the  provisions  of  Sections  2.3  and  2.10,  and  the  Certificate(s)  so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.



                                     - 9 -
<PAGE>

     (c) If any cash or any certificate representing Parent Shares is to be paid
to or issued in a name other  than that in which a  Certificate  surrendered  in
exchange therefor is registered, a certificate representing the proper number of
shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a person other than the person in
whose name the  Certificate so surrendered  is registered,  if such  Certificate
shall be properly  endorsed or  otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
person  requesting  such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or
other Taxes  required by reason of the payment of cash or the issuance of shares
of Parent  Common  Stock to a person  other than the  registered  holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not  applicable.  Until  surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.7,  each  Certificate  shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent  only the right to receive upon such  surrender the cash,  the
certificate  representing  shares of Parent  Common Stock or cash in lieu of any
fractional  shares of Parent Common Stock,  as  applicable.  No interest will be
paid or will accrue on any cash so payable.

     (d) If any holder of converted  Company Shares shall be unable to surrender
such holder's  Certificates  because such  Certificates  shall have been lost or
destroyed,  such holder may deliver in lieu thereof an affidavit  and  indemnity
bond in form and substance and with surety reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

     SECTION 2.8 Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged  Shares. No dividends
or other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with
a record  date  after  the  Effective  Time  shall be paid to the  holder of any
unsurrendered  Certificate  with respect to the Parent Common Stock  represented
thereby by reason of the  conversion of shares of Company  Common Stock pursuant
to  Section  2.3  and no  cash  shall  be paid to any  such  holder  until  such
Certificate is surrendered or deemed surrendered in accordance with this Article
II. Subject to the effect of applicable  laws,  following  surrender of any such
Certificate,  there shall be paid, without interest, to the person in whose name
the shares of Parent Common Stock representing such shares are registered (i) at
the time of such surrender,  the amount of any cash payable to which such holder
is entitled  pursuant to this  Section 2.8 and (ii) at the  appropriate  payment
date or as promptly  as  practicable  thereafter,  the  proportionate  amount of
dividends or other  distributions,  with (x) a record date with respect  thereto
after the Effective  Time, but prior to such  surrender,  and (y) a payment date
subsequent  to such  surrender,  payable  with  respect to such shares of Parent
Common Stock.

     SECTION  2.9 No  Further  Ownership  Rights.  All cash and shares of Parent
Common  Stock  issued  upon  the  surrender  for  exchange  of  Certificates  in
accordance  with the terms of this Article II (including  any cash paid pursuant
to  Section  2.10)  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  issued  and  paid in full
satisfaction  of  all  rights  pertaining  to  the  Company  Shares  theretofore
represented by such Certificates. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the  Surviving  Corporation  or the Exchange  Agent for any reason,
they shall be canceled and  exchanged as provided in this Article II,  except as
otherwise provided by law.



                                     - 10 -

     SECTION 2.10 No Fractional  Shares.  No certificates or scrip  representing
fractional  shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of  Certificates,  and such fractional share interests will not entitle
the  owner  thereof  to  vote  or to any  rights  of a  stockholder  of  Parent.
Notwithstanding  any other provision of this  Agreement,  each holder of Company
Shares  exchanged  pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction  of a share of Parent  Common  Stock  (after  taking  into
account all  Certificates  delivered  by such  holder)  shall  receive,  in lieu
thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a
share of  Parent  Common  Stock  multiplied  by the  Stock  Value.  The  parties
acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional
shares was not separately  bargained for  consideration  but merely represents a
mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the corporate and accounting
complexities  which would  otherwise  be caused by the  issuance  of  fractional
shares.

     SECTION 2.11 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains  undistributed  to the holders of the  Certificates for six months
after the  Effective  Time shall be  delivered to Parent,  upon demand,  and any
holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore  complied with this Article
II shall  thereafter  look only to Parent for payment of cash and Parent  Common
Stock,  any cash in lieu of fractional  shares of Parent  Common Stock,  and any
dividends or  distributions  with respect to Parent  Common  Stock,  all without
interest.

     SECTION 2.12 No Liability.  To the fullest  extent  permitted by applicable
law,  none of Parent,  Merger Sub,  the Company or the  Exchange  Agent shall be
liable to any  person in  respect  of any  shares  of  Parent  Common  Stock (or
dividends or distributions  with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official  pursuant to any applicable  abandoned  property,
escheat or similar  law.  If any  Certificates  shall not have been  surrendered
prior to the end of the applicable period after the Effective Time under escheat
laws  (or   immediately   prior  to  such  earlier  date  on  which  any  Merger
Consideration  or any dividends or  distributions  with respect to Parent Common
Stock in respect of such  Certificates  would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any  governmental  entity),  any such  shares,  cash,  dividends  or
distributions in respect of such Certificates  shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear
of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

     SECTION 2.13  Investment of Exchange  Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash  included in the Exchange  Fund on a daily basis as directed by Parent.
Any interest and other income resulting from such  investments  shall be paid to
Parent.



                                     - 11 -

     SECTION 2.14 Transfer Taxes.  Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the
preparation,  execution  and  filing  of  all  returns,  applications  or  other
documents regarding any real property transfer, stamp, recording, documentary or
other  taxes and any other  fees and  similar  taxes  which  become  payable  in
connection with the Merger other than transfer or stamp taxes payable in respect
of transfers pursuant to Section 2.7(c)  (collectively,  "Transfer Taxes"). From
and after the  Effective  Time,  Parent  shall pay or cause to be paid,  without
deduction  or  withholding  from any  amounts  payable to the holders of Company
Shares, all Transfer Taxes.

                                  ARTICLE III.

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

     Except  as  disclosed  in a  separate  disclosure  schedule  which has been
delivered by the Company to the Parent prior to the date of this  Agreement (the
"Company Disclosure  Schedule") (which Company Disclosure Schedule shall contain
appropriate  references to identify the representations and warranties herein to
which the information in such Company Disclosure Schedule relates),  the Company
hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

     SECTION 3.1 Organization,  Existence and Good Standing of the Company.  The
Company is a corporation  duly organized and validly  existing under the laws of
the  State of  Indiana.  The  Company  has all  necessary  corporate  power  and
authority  to own its  properties  and  assets and to carry on its  business  as
presently  conducted.  The Company is  qualified  to do business  and is in good
standing in each  jurisdiction  where the nature or  character  of the  property
owned,  leased or operated by it or the nature of the business  transacted by it
makes such qualification necessary,  except where the failure to be so qualified
or be in good  standing  is not  reasonably  likely to have a  Company  Material
Adverse Effect.  The Company has delivered to Parent a complete and correct copy
of its  Amended  and  Restated  Articles  of  Incorporation  (the  "Articles  of
Incorporation") and Bylaws as amended to the date hereof.

     SECTION  3.2   Organization,   Existence   and  Good  Standing  of  Company
Subsidiaries.  Section 3.2 of the Company Disclosure  Schedule sets forth a list
of each subsidiary of the Company (each a "Company Subsidiary" and, collectively
the "Company Subsidiaries"),  the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization,
as applicable,  of each Company  Subsidiary,  the type of entity of each Company
Subsidiary,  the percentage of the ownership of the outstanding capital stock or
interest  in each  Company  Subsidiary  by the  Company or by any other  Company
Subsidiary and the authorized  and  outstanding  capital stock of each corporate
Company  Subsidiary.  Each Company Subsidiary is a corporation,  business trust,
general or limited  partnership or limited  liability  company (as so specified)
duly organized, validly existing and (to the extent applicable) in good standing
under the laws of the  jurisdiction of its  incorporation  or  organization,  as
applicable. Each Company Subsidiary has all necessary entity power and authority
to own its  properties  and assets  and to carry on its  business  as  presently
conducted.  Each Company  Subsidiary  is qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each  jurisdiction  where the nature or  character  of the  property
owned,  leased or operated by it or the nature of the business  transacted by it


                                     - 12 -
<PAGE>

makes such qualification necessary,  except where the failure to be so qualified
or be in good  standing  is not  reasonably  likely to have a  Company  Material
Adverse Effect.  Except for the Company  Subsidiaries and except as set forth in
Section 3.2 of the Company Disclosure  Schedule,  the Company does not, directly
or indirectly,  own any equity interest in any other  corporation,  association,
partnership,  joint venture,  business organization or limited liability company
or other  entity,  with  respect to which  interest  the  Company or any Company
Subsidiary  has  invested or is required to invest  $100,000 or more,  excluding
securities in any publicly  traded  company held for  investment  and comprising
less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding voting securities of such company,
nor has the Company entered into any agreement,  arrangement or understanding to
make any such investment.

     SECTION 3.3 Capitalization.

     (a)  The  authorized  capital  stock  of the  Company  consists  solely  of
30,000,000  shares of Company Common Stock,  and 10,000,000  shares of preferred
stock,  no par value ("Company  Preferred  Stock").  As of the date hereof:  (i)
10,671,503 shares of Company Common Stock are issued and outstanding,  no shares
of Company Common Stock are held in treasury, and no shares of Company Preferred
Stock are issued and  outstanding;  and (ii)  248,600  shares of Company  Common
Stock are reserved for purchase pursuant to the Company Option Plans. All of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are, and all shares of Company Common
Stock  which may be issued  prior to the  Effective  Time upon  exercise  of any
option or other right will be, validly issued,  fully paid and nonassessable and
free of  preemptive  rights.  Except as set forth  above,  as of the date hereof
there are  outstanding no shares of capital stock or other voting  securities of
the Company and no equity  equivalent  interests in the ownership or earnings of
the  Company  or the  Company  Subsidiaries.  All of the  outstanding  shares of
capital  stock,  or other  ownership  interest,  of each Company  Subsidiary are
validly issued,  fully paid and  nonassessable,  and are owned by the Company or
another  Company  Subsidiary  free and clear of all security  interests,  liens,
claims, pledges, charges or other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.

     (b) Section 3.3 of the Company  Disclosure  Schedule  sets forth a true and
complete list of all outstanding rights,  including options, to purchase Company
Common Stock, the name of each holder thereof,  the number of shares purchasable
thereunder,  the date of  vesting of such  right,  any rights of holders of such
rights  that will be  triggered  by the  consummation  of the Merger and the per
share exercise or purchase  price of each right.  There are no securities of the
Company or any Company  Subsidiary  convertible  or  exchangeable  for shares of
capital  stock or voting  securities  of the Company or any Company  Subsidiary;
and,  except as set forth in Section  3.3 of the  Company  Disclosure  Schedule,
there are no options, warrants or other similar rights, agreements, arrangements
or commitments of any character obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary


                                     - 13 -
<PAGE>

to issue or sell any shares of capital  stock of, or other equity  interests in,
the Company or any Company Subsidiary.  There are no obligations,  contingent or
otherwise,  of the Company or any Company  Subsidiary to  repurchase,  redeem or
otherwise  acquire any shares of Company  Common  Stock or the capital  stock or
other equity  interest of any Company  Subsidiary or to make any  investment (in
the  form  of  a  loan,  capital  contribution  or  otherwise)  in  any  Company
Subsidiary.

     SECTION 3.4  Authority  Relative  to this  Agreement;  Recommendation.  The
Company has all necessary  corporate  power and authority to execute and deliver
this  Agreement and to perform its  obligations  hereunder and to consummate the
transactions  contemplated  hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the  Company  and  the  consummation  by  the  Company  of  the  transactions
contemplated  hereby  have been duly and  validly  authorized  by all  necessary
corporate action, and no other corporate  proceedings on the part of the Company
are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the  transactions  so
contemplated  (other  than the  approval of this  Agreement  by the holders of a
majority of the  outstanding  shares of the Company  Common Stock in  accordance
with the IBCL and the Company's Articles of  Incorporation).  This Agreement has
been duly and validly  executed and  delivered by the Company and,  assuming the
due authorization,  execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes
a legal,  valid and binding  obligation of the Company  enforceable  against the
Company in accordance with its terms. The Board of Directors of the Company (the
"Company  Board") has, at a meeting duly called and held at which all  directors
of the Company  were  present,  duly and  unanimously  adopted  resolutions  (i)
approving  and declaring the  advisability  of this  Agreement and the Merger in
accordance with the IBCL and the Company's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws,
(ii)  determining that this Agreement and the Merger are fair to and in the best
interests  of the  stockholders  of the  Company,  (iii)  determining  that  the
consideration  to be paid in the Merger is fair to and in the best  interests of
the stockholders of the Company and (iv)  recommending  that the stockholders of
the Company approve this Agreement; which resolutions have not been subsequently
rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way.

     SECTION 3.5 Material  Contracts.  Except as set forth in Section 3.5 of the
Company  Disclosure  Schedule,  the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended  December 31, 2000 and Quarterly  Reports on Form 10-Q for the
periods  ended March 31, 2001,  June 30, 2001 and September 30, 2001 set forth a
list of all agreements to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party
or by which any of them is bound which, as of the date hereof:  (i) are required
to be filed as "material  contracts" with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "Exchange Act"); (ii) under which the consequences of a default,
nonrenewal  or  termination  is  reasonably  likely to have a  Company  Material
Adverse  Effect;  or (iii)  pursuant  to which  payments  might be  required  or
acceleration  of  benefits  may be  required  upon a "change of  control" of the
Company,  or upon execution of this Agreement by the Company or the  performance
by the Company of its obligations hereunder (collectively, the "Company Material
Contracts").

     SECTION 3.6 No Conflict.  Except as set forth in Section 3.6 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company nor the  consummation  by the Company of the  transactions  contemplated
hereby nor the compliance by the Company with any of the provisions hereof will,
(i)  conflict  with or violate the  Articles of  Incorporation  or Bylaws of the
Company,  (ii)  conflict  with or  violate  any law,  rule,  regulation,  order,
judgment or decree  applicable  to the Company or any Company  Subsidiary  or by
which its or any of their respective  assets or properties are bound or affected
(such laws, rules,  regulations,  orders,  judgments or decrees  applicable with
respect to a party or such party's assets or properties, the "Applicable Laws"),
or (iii) result in any breach of or  constitute a default (or an event that with
notice or lapse of time or both  would  become a default)  under,  or impair the
rights  of the  Company  or any  Company  Subsidiary,  or alter  the  rights  or
obligations  of any  third  party  under,  or  give  to  others  any  rights  of
termination, amendment, acceleration, purchase or cancellation, or result in the
creation  of a lien or  encumbrance  on any of the  properties  or assets of the
Company  or any  Company  Subsidiary  pursuant  to,  any note,  bond,  mortgage,
indenture,  contract,  agreement,  lease,  license,  permit,  franchise or other
instrument  or  obligation  to which the Company or any Company  Subsidiary is a
party  or by  which  the  Company  or any  Company  Subsidiary  or any of  their
respective  assets or properties are bound or affected,  except in any such case
for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that
are not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 3.7  Required  Filings and  Consents.  Neither  the  execution  and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor the consummation by the Company of
the transactions  contemplated hereby nor the compliance by the Company with any

except (i) for applicable  requirements,  if any, of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the  "Securities  Act"),  the Exchange Act,  state  securities  laws

required  by the DGCL and the IBCL,  and (ii) where the  failure to obtain  such
consents,  approvals,  authorizations  or  permits,  or to make such  filings or
notifications,  would  not  prevent  or delay  consummation  of the  Merger,  or
otherwise  prevent or delay the Company from  performing its  obligations  under

Company  Subsidiary  has  any  liabilities  (absolute,  accrued,  contingent  or
otherwise), except liabilities (a) for which in the aggregate there are adequate

actions,  suits,  proceedings or investigations  pending or, to the knowledge of

arbitrator or  administrative,  governmental  or  regulatory  authority or body,
domestic or foreign,  that would be required to be disclosed in an Annual Report

consummation  of the Merger,  or  otherwise  prevent or delay the  Company  from
performing its obligations  under this Agreement.  None of the claims,  actions,
suits, proceedings and investigations so set forth are reasonably likely to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect.

which,  individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect; (iii) all Company Employee Plans are in compliance with

Subsidiary  have  performed  all  obligations  required to be  performed by them
under,  and are not in default under or violation of any of the Company Employee
Plans  except  as is  not  reasonably  likely  to  have  individually  or in the

3.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,  each Company Employee Plan intended to
qualify  under  Section  401(a) of the Code and each trust  intended  to qualify
under  Section  501(a)  of the  Code is so  qualified  and is the  subject  of a
favorable  determination  letter from the IRS, such determination letter has not
been  revoked or  threatened  to be revoked by the IRS, to the  knowledge of the
Company,  nothing has occurred since the date of such determination  letter that
could  adversely  affect the tax exempt status of such Company  Employee Plan or
the tax exempt status of any related trust,  and each such Company Employee Plan
which is not an IRS-approved master or prototype plan has been amended to comply
with  the  tax  laws  referred  to as  "GUST"  and  submitted  to the  IRS for a
determination  letter that the Company Employee Plan, as amended,  satisfies the
qualification requirements of Section 401(a) the Code; (v) except as provided by
Sections  204(h),  4041(a)(2) or 104(b)(1) of ERISA,  each Company Employee Plan
can be amended or  terminated  at any time  without  approval  from any  person,
without  advance  notice,  and without  any  liability  other than for  benefits
accrued  prior to such  amendment  or  termination;  (vi) except as set forth in
Section  3.15 of the Company  Disclosure  Schedule,  all benefits due under each
Employee  Plan have been timely paid and there is no material  lawsuit or claim,
other than routine uncontested claims for benefits, pending, or to the knowledge
of the Company,  any Company ERISA Affiliate or Company Subsidiary,  threatened,
against  any  Company  Employee  Plan or the  fiduciaries  of any  such  plan or
otherwise  involving or pertaining to any such plan, and no basis exists for any
such lawsuit or claim;  (vii) except as set forth in Section 3.15 of the Company
Disclosure  Schedule,  no Company  Employee Plan provides for any severance pay,
accelerated  payments,  deemed  satisfaction  of  goals  or  conditions,  new or
increased benefits, forgiveness or modification of loans, or vesting conditioned
in whole or in part upon a "change in control" of the  Company,  as such term is
defined  in the  Company  Employee  Plan or in  Section  280G of the  Code  (and
regulations  promulgated  thereunder),  any Company  ERISA  Affiliate or Company
Subsidiary, or any plant closing; (viii) no agreement, commitment, or obligation
exists to increase any benefits under any Company  Employee Plan or to adopt any
new Company  Employee Plan;  and (ix) no Company  Employee Plan has any unfunded
accrued  benefits  that  are not  fully  reflected  in the  Company's  financial
statements.

     SECTION 3.16 Labor Matters.  (i) There are no controversies  pending or, to
the  knowledge  of the Company,  threatened,  between the Company or any Company
Subsidiary  and any of  their  respective  employees,  which  controversies  are
reasonably  likely to have  individually or in the aggregate a Company  Material
Adverse Effect;  (ii) neither the Company nor any Company  Subsidiary is a party
to any material  collective  bargaining  agreement or other labor union contract
applicable  to persons  employed by the Company or any Company  Subsidiary,  nor
does the Company know of any  activities  or  proceedings  of any labor union to
organize  any such  employees;  and (iii) the  Company has no  knowledge  of any


                                     - 19 -
<PAGE>

strikes,  slowdowns,  work stoppages,  lockouts,  or threats thereof, by or with
respect to any  employees  of the  Company or any Company  Subsidiary  which are
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of
the Company,  as of the date hereof, no executive or management  employee of the
Company or any of the Company  Subsidiaries  intends to terminate his employment
in connection with the Merger.

     SECTION  3.17  Restrictions  on  Business   Activities.   Except  for  this
Agreement, there is no agreement with any person, judgment,  injunction,  order,
decree, statute,  ordinance,  rule, regulation,  moratorium or other action by a
Governmental Entity, or to the knowledge of the Company, pending before or being
considered  by a  Governmental  Entity,  binding upon the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, which has or would have the effect of prohibiting or restricting the
conduct of  business  by the  Company or any  Company  Subsidiary  as  currently
conducted  or  intended  to  be  conducted,   except  for  any  prohibitions  or
restrictions  as are not  reasonably  likely  to  have,  individually  or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 3.18 Real Property.  The Company and the Company  Subsidiaries have
good  and  marketable  (or  indefeasible,   in  jurisdictions   where  the  term
"marketable" is not  customarily  used in such a context) title in fee simple to
the real property  purported to be owned by them,  and, upon the exercise of any
options  to  acquire  real  property  optioned  by the  Company  or any  Company
Subsidiary, the Company or such Company Subsidiary will have good and marketable
(or  indefeasible,   in  jurisdictions   where  the  term  "marketable"  is  not
customarily  used  in such a  context)  title  in fee  simple  to such  optioned
property,  in each case free and clear of all liens,  charges and  encumbrances,
except  liens  for  Taxes  not yet due and  payable  and  such  liens  or  other
encumbrances as do not or will not materially  interfere with the present use or
intended use by the Company and the Company  Subsidiaries  or materially  affect
the value of or the ability to market to customers the property affected thereby
and that are not reasonably likely to have,  individually or in the aggregate, a
Company  Material  Adverse  Effect.  Except as set forth in Section  3.18 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries hold valid
policies of title insurance  issued by reputable  title  insurance  companies on
each  parcel of real  property  owned by them in amounts  equal to the  purchase
price  paid  by the  Company  or  such  Company  Subsidiary  at the  time of its
acquisition  thereof.  Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has given,
nor have they received,  any notice or information indicating that the facts set
forth in any surveys or title insurance  policies are untrue or incorrect in any
material  respect  nor has the Company or any Company  Subsidiary  received  any
notice that a breach or an event of default  exists,  and no  condition or event
has occurred  that with the giving of notice,  the lapse of time,  or both would
constitute  a  breach  or  event  of  default,  by the  Company  or any  Company
Subsidiary, or to the knowledge of the Company, any other person with respect to
any material contracts, covenants, conditions and restrictions,  deeds, deeds of
trust, rights-of-way,  easements,  mortgages and other documents granting to the


                                     - 20 -
<PAGE>

Company  or any  Company  Subsidiary  title to or an  interest  in or  otherwise
affecting the real  property  which is material to the operation of the business
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,  as presently conducted or intended
to be  conducted,  except  for  such  breach  or event  of  default  that is not
reasonably likely to have,  individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse  Effect.  To the  knowledge of the  Company,  no  condemnation,  eminent
domain, or similar  proceeding exists, is pending or threatened with respect to,
or that could affect,  any real  property  owned or leased by the Company or any
Company  Subsidiary that is reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. No  developer-related  charges or assessments for off-site  improvements
payable to any public authority or any other person for public  improvements are
unpaid  (other than those  reflected  on the Company  Balance  Sheet or incurred
since  the date of the  Company  Balance  Sheet in the  ordinary  course  of the
Company's  business  consistent  with past  practices),  except  for  charges or
assessments  as are  not  reasonably  likely  to  have,  individually  or in the
aggregate,  a Company Material Adverse Effect.  To the knowledge of the Company,
there is no  material  impediment  to  obtaining  any  permits  or  governmental
approvals  required  to develop  lots or  construct  homes on  undeveloped  real
property  held by the  Company or a Company  Subsidiary  for such  purpose  (the
"Company Development  Properties"),  except for such as is not reasonably likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.  The Company  Development  Properties
have  access  to  public  streets,  and are  serviced  (or will be  serviced  in
accordance  with  "will  serve  letters"  issued  by  the  appropriate   utility
provider),  in all material  respects,  by water,  gas and electricity and other
services that may be necessary to construct homes on such properties, and to the
knowledge  of the  Company  such  utilities  and other  services  are or will be
adequate for the current and intended use of such property.  All material leases
pursuant to which the Company or any Company  Subsidiary leases from others real
or  personal  property  are valid and in full force and effect and no default or
event of  default  by the  Company  or the  Company  Subsidiaries  has  occurred
thereunder,  except  where the lack of such  validity and  effectiveness  or the
existence  of such  defaults or event of defaults  is not  reasonably  likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 3.19 Taxes.

     (a) For  purposes  of this  Agreement,  "Tax" or "Taxes"  shall mean taxes,
fees, levies, duties, tariffs,  imposts, and governmental impositions or charges
of any kind,  in the nature of taxes,  payable to any federal,  state,  local or
foreign taxing authority,  including, without limitation, (i) income, franchise,
profits,  gross  receipts,  ad valorem,  net worth,  value  added,  sales,  use,
service, real or personal property, special assessments, capital stock, license,
payroll,  withholding,   employment,  social  security,  workers'  compensation,
unemployment  compensation,   utility,  severance,  production,  excise,  stamp,
occupation,  premiums,  windfall  profits,  transfer and gains taxes,  including
interest, penalties,  additional taxes and additions to tax imposed with respect
thereto,  (ii) any  liability  for  payment of amounts  described  in clause (i)
whether as a result of transferee liability, of being a member of an affiliated,
consolidated,  combined or unitary  group for any period,  or otherwise  through
operation of law, and (iii) any liability  for the payment of amounts  described
in clauses  (i) or (ii) as a result of any tax  sharing,  tax  indemnity  or tax
allocation  agreement or any other express or implied agreement to indemnify any
other person. For purposes of this Agreement,  "Tax Returns" shall mean returns,
reports,  and information  statements with respect to Taxes required to be filed
with the IRS or any other  taxing  authority,  domestic or  foreign,  including,
without limitation, consolidated, combined and unitary tax returns.

     (b) Except as provided in Section 3.19 of the Company Disclosure Schedule:

          (i) The  Company  and the  Company  Subsidiaries  have duly and timely
     (with  due  regard  to valid  extensions  properly  secured)  filed all Tax
     Returns  related to Federal income Taxes and all other material Tax Returns
     required to be filed by them prior to the date of this Agreement.  All such
     Tax Returns  are true,  correct and  complete in all  material  respects as
     filed (or as  validly  amended  thereafter).  Each of the  Company  and the
     Company  Subsidiaries  has  timely  (with due  regard  to valid  extensions
     properly  secured)  paid in full all Taxes shown as due on the face of such
     Tax  Returns,  except to the  extent of items  which  have been  adequately
     reserved   against  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted   accounting
     principles in the 2001 Company Balance Sheet.  The liabilities and reserves
     for Taxes  reflected in the 2001 Company  Balance Sheet cover all Taxes for
     all periods  ended at or prior to the date of such  balance  sheet and have
     been determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
     and all Taxes of the Company accrued following the date of the 2001 Company
     Balance  Sheet have been accrued in the ordinary  course of business of the
     Company and do not materially exceed comparable amounts incurred in similar
     periods in prior years  (taking into  account any changes in the  Company's
     operating results).

          (ii)  The  Company  and the  Company  Subsidiaries  have at all  times
     complied  in  all  respects  with  applicable  laws  pertaining  to  Taxes,
     including,  without  limitation,  all  applicable  laws  relating to record
     retention,  except as any such  noncompliance  is not reasonably  likely to
     have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

          (iii) No Federal  income  Tax  Return,  or  material  state,  local or
     foreign Tax Return, of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is the subject
     of a pending audit or other administrative  proceeding or court proceeding.
     Neither the Company  nor any of the  Company  Subsidiaries  is aware of any
     claim by any taxing  authority  that the Company or any Company  Subsidiary
     has been  required to file a Tax Return,  but has failed to do so.  Neither
     the Company nor any of the Company  Subsidiaries has requested an extension
     of time to file any Tax  Return  not yet filed,  nor has been  granted  any
     waiver of any statute of limitations with respect to, or any extension of a
     period for the assessment of, any Tax not yet paid. Neither the Company nor
     any  Company  Subsidiary  has  granted  a power of  attorney  that  will be
     outstanding on the Closing Date with respect to any material matter related
     to  Taxes.  In the past two  years  neither  the  Company  nor any  Company
     Subsidiary  has entered  into any  closing  agreement  with  respect to any
     Federal  income  Taxes or any other  material  Taxes that has the effect of
     materially  increasing  the liability for Taxes for any taxable year of the
     Company for which Tax Returns have not been filed.



                                     - 22 -
<PAGE>

          (iv)  Except as is not  reasonably  likely to have a Company  Material
     Adverse  Effect,  all Tax  deficiencies  that have been claimed,  proposed,
     asserted or  assessed in writing  against the Company or any of the Company
     Subsidiaries have been fully paid or finally settled and there is no claim,
     audit,  action,  suit,  proceeding,  investigation  or  assessment  pending
     against the Company or any of the  Company  Subsidiaries  in respect of any
     Tax.

          (v) No  issues  have  been  raised in any  examination  by any  taxing
     authority which, by application of similar principles,  reasonably could be
     expected to result in a material  proposed  deficiency for any other period
     not so examined.

          (vi) All Taxes that were  required to be  collected or withheld by the
     Company or any of the  Company  Subsidiaries  have been duly  collected  or
     withheld,  and all  such  Taxes  that  the  Company  or any of the  Company
     Subsidiaries  were required to remit to any taxing authority have been duly
     remitted, except where a failure to collect, withhold or remit Taxes is not
     reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

          (vii) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is aware
     of any  claim by any  taxing  authority  that the  Company  or any  Company
     Subsidiary  is  required  to include in income any  adjustment  pursuant to
     Section 481 of the Code (or similar  provisions of other law or regulation)
     by reason of a change in accounting  method,  nor has the Company or any of
     the Company  Subsidiaries  received  notice  that the IRS (or other  taxing
     authority) has proposed,  or is considering,  any such change in accounting
     method. The Company has not taken any action that is not in accordance with
     past  practice  that could defer a liability  for Taxes of the Company from
     any  taxable  period  ending on or before the  Closing  Date to any taxable
     period ending after such date.

          (viii) To the  knowledge of the Company  after  review of  appropriate
     documents filed with the SEC, the Company has no foreign  stockholders  for
     whom  shares of  Company  Common  Stock are  United  States  real  property
     interests as defined in Section 897 of the Code.

          (ix) The Company and the Company  Subsidiaries have disclosed on their
     respective  federal  income Tax Returns all  positions  taken  therein that

             REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

     Except  as  disclosed  in a  separate  disclosure  schedule  which has been
delivered by the Parent and Merger Sub to the Company  prior to the date of this
Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure  Schedule") (which Parent Disclosure  Schedule
shall  contain  appropriate  references  to  identify  the  representations  and
warranties  herein to which the information in such Parent  Disclosure  Schedule
relates),  Parent and Merger Sub hereby  represent and warrant to the Company as
follows:

     SECTION 4.1 Organization,  Existence and Good Standing of Parent and Merger
Sub.  Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a  corporation  duly  organized,  validly
existing and in good  standing  under the laws of the State of Delaware.  Parent
has all necessary corporate power and authority to own its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as presently  conducted.  Parent is qualified to do
business  and is in good  standing  in each  jurisdiction  where  the  nature or
character of the property  owned,  leased or operated by it or the nature of the
business transacted by it makes such qualification  necessary,  except where the
failure to be so qualified or be in good  standing is not  reasonably  likely to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Merger Sub does not presently conduct any
business and was formed solely for the purpose of effecting the Merger.  Each of
Parent and Merger Sub has  delivered  to the Company a complete and correct copy
of its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as amended to the date hereof.

     SECTION  4.2   Organization,   Existence   and  Good   Standing  of  Parent

applicable,  of each  Parent  Subsidiary,  the  type of  entity  of each  Parent
Subsidiary,  the percentage of the ownership of the outstanding capital stock or
interest in each Parent Subsidiary by Parent or by any other Parent  Subsidiary,

Subsidiary. Each Parent Subsidiary is a corporation,  business trust, general or
limited  partnership  or  limited  liability  company  (as  so  specified)  duly
organized,  validly  existing  and  in  good  standing  under  the  laws  of the
jurisdiction of its  incorporation or organization,  as applicable.  Each Parent
Subsidiary  has all necessary  entity power and authority to own its  properties
and assets and to carry on its  business  as  presently  conducted.  Each Parent

<PAGE>

Subsidiary  is  qualified  to do  business  and  is in  good  standing  in  each
jurisdiction  where the nature or  character of the  property  owned,  leased or
operated  by it or the  nature  of the  business  transacted  by it  makes  such
qualification  necessary,  except  where the failure to be so qualified or be in
good standing is not reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Except for the Parent Subsidiaries, Parent does not, directly or indirectly, own
any equity interest in any other corporation,  association,  partnership,  joint
venture,  business  organization or limited  liability  company or other entity,
with respect to which interest  Parent or any Parent  Subsidiary has invested or
is required to invest  $100,000 or more,  excluding  securities  in any publicly
traded company held for investment and comprising  less than one percent (1%) of

Parent's 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (collectively the "Parent Option Plans"). All
of the  outstanding  shares of Parent Common Stock are, and all shares of Parent
Common Stock which may be issued prior to the  Effective  Time upon  exercise of
any option or other right will be, validly issued,  fully paid and nonassessable

Parent  Subsidiary  free and clear of all  security  interests,  liens,  claims,

complete list of all outstanding  rights,  including options, to purchase Parent
Common Stock, the name of each holder thereof,  the number of shares purchasable

capital  stock or voting  securities  of Parent or any Parent  Subsidiary;  and,

no options,  warrants  or other  similar  rights,  agreements,  arrangements  or
commitments of any character obligating Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to issue
or sell any shares of capital stock of, or other equity  interests in, Parent or
any Parent  Subsidiary.  There are no obligations,  contingent or otherwise,  of
Parent or any Parent  Subsidiary to repurchase,  redeem or otherwise acquire any
shares of Parent Common Stock or the capital  stock or other equity  interest of
any Parent Subsidiary or to make any investment (in the form of a loan,  capital
contribution or otherwise) in any Parent Subsidiary.

Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub nor the  consummation  by Parent or Merger Sub

Subsidiary, or alter the rights or obligations of any third party under, or give
to others  any  rights of  termination,  amendment,  acceleration,  purchase  or
cancellation,  or result in the creation of a lien or  encumbrance on any of the
properties or assets of Parent or any Parent  Subsidiary  pursuant to, any note,
bond,  mortgage,   indenture,   contract,  agreement,  lease,  license,  permit,
franchise  or other  instrument  or  obligation  to which  Parent or any  Parent
Subsidiary  is a party or by which  Parent or any  Parent  Subsidiary  or any of

not  reasonably  likely  to have,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.  Parent and Parent  Subsidiaries are in compliance with

in the ordinary course of business  consistent  with past practice;  or (vi) any
action or event that would have required the consent of the Company  pursuant to
Section 5.1 had such action or event occurred after the date of this Agreement.

     SECTION  4.13 No  Undisclosed  Liabilities.  Neither  Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary has any  liabilities  (absolute,  accrued,  contingent or otherwise),
except liabilities (a) for which in the aggregate there are adequate reserves in
Parent's  audited  balance sheet  (including  any related  notes  thereto) as of
September  30,  2001 (the "2001  Parent  Balance  Sheet"),  (b)  incurred in the
ordinary course of business before the date of the 2001 Parent Balance Sheet and
not required under generally accepted  accounting  principles to be reflected on
the 2001 Parent Balance Sheet,  or (c) incurred since  September 30, 2001 in the
ordinary course of business  consistent with past practice or in connection with
this Agreement,  that is not reasonably  likely to have,  individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION  4.14  Litigation.  Except as set forth in the Parent SEC  Reports,
there are no claims, actions,  suits,  proceedings or investigations pending or,
to the knowledge of Parent,  threatened  against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
or any properties or rights of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary before any court,
arbitrator or  administrative,  governmental  or  regulatory  authority or body,
domestic or foreign,  that would be required to be disclosed in an Annual Report
on  Form  10-K or  that  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  prevent  or  delay
consummation of the Merger, or otherwise prevent or delay Parent from performing
its  obligations  under this  Agreement.  None of the  claims,  actions,  suits,
proceedings  and  investigations  so set  forth is  reasonably  likely to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4975 of the Code,  or a breach of  fiduciary  duty within the meaning of
Section  404  of  ERISA,  with  respect  to any  Parent  Employee  Plan,  which,
individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to have a Parent Material
Adverse  Effect;  (iii) all Parent  Employee  Plans are in  compliance  with the
requirements  prescribed by any and all statutes (including ERISA and the Code),
orders, or governmental  rules and regulations  currently in effect with respect
thereto (including all applicable  requirements for notification to participants
or the Department of Labor,  the PBGC, IRS or Secretary of the Treasury)  except
as is not reasonably  likely to have  individually  or in the aggregate a Parent
Material  Adverse Effect,  and Parent and each Parent  Subsidiary have performed
all obligations  required to be performed by them under,  and are not in default
under  or  violation  of any of  the  Parent  Employee  Plans  except  as is not
reasonably  likely to have  individually  or in the aggregate a Parent  Material
Adverse Effect; (iv) each Parent Employee Plan intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code and each trust  intended to qualify under  Section  501(a) of
the Code is so qualified and is the subject of a favorable  determination letter

revoked by the IRS, to the knowledge of Parent,  nothing has occurred  since the
date of such  determination  letter that could  adversely  affect the tax exempt
status of such  Parent  Employee  Plan or the tax exempt  status of any  related
trust, and each such Parent Employee Plan which is not an IRS-approved master or
prototype plan has been amended to comply with GUST and submitted to the IRS for
a determination letter that the Parent Employee Plan, as amended,  satisfies the
qualification requirements of Section 401(a) the Code; (v) except as provided by
Sections 204(h), 4041(a)(2) or 104(b)(1) of ERISA, each Parent Employee Plan can
be amended or terminated at any time without  approval from any person,  without
advance notice,  and without any liability other than for benefits accrued prior

     SECTION 4.16 Labor Matters.  (i) There are no controversies  pending or, to
the knowledge of Parent, threatened, between Parent or any Parent Subsidiary and
any of their respective employees,  which controversies are reasonably be likely
to have individually or in the aggregate a Parent Material Adverse Effect;  (ii)
neither Parent nor any Parent  Subsidiary is a party to any material  collective
bargaining  agreement  or other  labor  union  contract  applicable  to  persons
employed  by  Parent  or any  Parent  Subsidiary,  nor does  Parent  know of any
activities or proceedings of any labor union to organize any such employees; and
(iii)  Parent  has no  knowledge  of any  strikes,  slowdowns,  work  stoppages,
lockouts,  or threats thereof,  by or with respect to any employees of Parent or
any Parent  Subsidiary  which are  reasonably  likely to have a Parent  Material
Adverse Effect.  To the knowledge of Parent, as of the date hereof, no executive
or management  employee of Parent or any of the Parent  Subsidiaries  intends to
terminate his employment in connection with the Merger.

     SECTION  4.17  Restrictions  on  Business   Activities.   Except  for  this
Agreement, there is no agreement with any person, judgment,  injunction,  order,
decree, statute,  ordinance,  rule, regulation,  moratorium or other action by a
Governmental  Entity,  or to the  knowledge of Parent,  pending  before or being
considered  by  a  Governmental  Entity,  binding  upon  Parent  or  any  Parent
Subsidiary, which has or would have the effect of prohibiting or restricting the
conduct of business by Parent or any Parent  Subsidiary as currently  conducted,
or intended to be conducted,  except for any prohibitions or restrictions  which
are not reasonably  likely to have,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 4.18 Real  Property.  The Parent and the Parent  Subsidiaries  have
good  and  marketable  (or  indefeasible,   in  jurisdictions   where  the  term
"marketable" is not  customarily  used in such a context) title in fee simple to
the real property  purported to be owned by them,  and, upon the exercise of any
options to acquire real  property  optioned by Parent or any Parent  Subsidiary,
Parent or such Parent Subsidiary will have good and marketable (or indefeasible,


                                     - 35 -
<PAGE>

in jurisdictions  where the term  "marketable" is not customarily used in such a
context)  title in fee simple to such optioned  property,  in each case free and
clear of all liens, charges and encumbrances, except liens for Taxes not yet due
and  payable  and  such  liens  or  other  encumbrances  as do not or  will  not
materially  interfere  with the present  use or  intended  use by Parent and the
Parent  Subsidiaries or materially  affect the value of or the ability to market
to customers the property  affected thereby and which are not reasonably  likely
to have,  individually or in the aggregate,  a Parent  Material  Adverse Effect.
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries hold valid policies of title insurance issued
by reputable title insurance  companies on each parcel of real property owned by
them in  amounts  equal to the  purchase  price  paid by Parent  or such  Parent
Subsidiary at the time of its acquisition thereof. Neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary  has  given,  nor have  they  received,  any  notice  or  information
indicating that the facts set forth in any surveys or title  insurance  policies
are untrue or  incorrect  in any  material  respect nor has Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary  received any notice that a breach or an event of default exists, and
no condition or event has occurred that with the giving of notice,  the lapse of
time,  or both would  constitute a breach or event of default,  by Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary,  or to the knowledge of Parent, any other person with respect
to any material contracts, covenants, conditions and restrictions,  deeds, deeds
of trust,  rights-of-way,  easements,  mortgages and other documents granting to
Parent  or  any  Parent  Subsidiary  title  to or an  interest  in or  otherwise
affecting the real  property  which is material to the operation of the business
of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries,  as presently conducted or intended to be
conducted,  except for such  breach or event of default  that is not  reasonably
likely to have,  individually  or in the aggregate,  a Parent  Material  Adverse
Effect. To the knowledge of Parent, no condemnation,  eminent domain, or similar
proceeding  exists,  is pending or  threatened  with  respect  to, or that could
affect,  any real  property  owned or leased by Parent or any Parent  Subsidiary
that  is  reasonably  likely  to  have a  Parent  Material  Adverse  Effect.  No
developer-related  charges or assessments for off-site  improvements  payable to
any public  authority  or any other  person for public  improvements  are unpaid
(other than those  reflected on the Parent  Balance Sheet or incurred  since the
date of the Parent  Balance  Sheet in the ordinary  course of Parent's  business
consistent  with past  practices),  except for charges or  assessments  that are
reasonably likely to have,  individually or in the aggregate,  a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Parent,  there is no material  impediment to
obtaining  any permits or  governmental  approvals  required to develop  lots or
construct  homes  on  undeveloped  real  property  held by  Parent  or a  Parent
Subsidiary for such purpose (the "Parent  Development  Properties"),  except for
such as is not reasonably  likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.  The
Parent  Development  Properties have access to public streets,  and are serviced
(or will be  serviced in  accordance  with "will  serve  letters"  issued by the
appropriate  utility  provider),  in all material  respects,  by water,  gas and
electricity  and other services that may be necessary to construct homes on such
properties, and to the knowledge of Parent such utilities and other services are
or will be adequate  for the  current and  intended  use of such  property.  All
material  leases pursuant to which Parent or any Parent  Subsidiary  leases from
others real or personal  property  are valid and in full force and effect and no
default or event of default by Parent or the Parent  Subsidiaries  has  occurred
thereunder,  except  where the lack of such  validity and  effectiveness  or the
existence  of such  defaults or event of defaults  is not  reasonably  likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 4.19 Taxes.

     (a) Except as provided in Section 4.19 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule:



                                     - 36 -
<PAGE>

          (i) Parent and the Parent  Subsidiaries have duly and timely (with due
     regard to valid extensions  properly secured) filed all Tax Returns related
     to Federal income Taxes and all other  material Tax Returns  required to be
     filed by them prior to the date of this Agreement. All such Tax Returns are
     true, correct and complete in all material respects as filed (or as validly
     amended thereafter).  Each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries has timely
     (with due regard to valid  extensions  properly  secured)  paid in full all
     Taxes shown as due on the face of such Tax Returns, except to the extent of
     items  which  have been  adequately  reserved  against in  accordance  with
     generally accepted accounting  principles in the 2001 Parent Balance Sheet.
     The liabilities and reserves for Taxes reflected in the 2001 Parent Balance
     Sheet cover all Taxes for all periods ended at or prior to the date of such
     balance  sheet  and have  been  determined  in  accordance  with  generally
     accepted  accounting  principles and all Taxes of Parent accrued  following
     the end of the most  recent  period  covered  by the  financial  statements
     included in Parent's  September 30, 2001 Form 10-K have been accrued in the
     ordinary  course  of  business  of  Parent  and  do not  materially  exceed
     comparable  amounts incurred in similar periods in prior years (taking into
     account any changes in Parent's operating results).

          (ii) Parent and the Parent  Subsidiaries have at all times complied in
     all respects with applicable laws pertaining to Taxes,  including,  without
     limitation, all applicable laws relating to record retention,  except as is
     not reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

          (iii) No Federal  income  Tax  Return,  or  material  state,  local or
     foreign Tax Return of Parent or any Parent  Subsidiary  is the subject of a
     pending  audit  or other  administrative  proceeding  or court  proceeding.
     Neither Parent nor any of the Parent  Subsidiaries is aware of any claim by
     any taxing authority that Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has been required
     to file a Tax Return,  but has failed to do so.  Neither  Parent nor any of
     the Parent  Subsidiaries has requested an extension of time to file any Tax
     Return not yet filed,  nor has been  granted  any waiver of any  statute of
     limitations  with  respect  to,  or  any  extension  of a  period  for  the
     assessment  of,  any  Tax not  yet  paid.  Neither  Parent  nor any  Parent
     Subsidiary  has granted a power of attorney that will be outstanding on the
     Closing Date with respect to any material  matter related to Taxes.  In the
     past two years neither  Parent nor any Parent  Subsidiary  has entered into
     any closing agreement with respect to any Federal income Taxes or any other
     material  Taxes that has the effect of materially  increasing the liability
     for Taxes for any  taxable  year of Parent for which Tax  Returns  have not
     been filed.

          (iv)  Except as is not  reasonably  likely  to have a Parent  Material
     Adverse  Effect,  all Tax  deficiencies  that have been claimed,  proposed,
     asserted  or  assessed  in  writing  against  Parent  or any of the  Parent
     Subsidiaries have been fully paid or finally settled and there is no claim,
     audit,  action,  suit,  proceeding,  investigation  or  assessment  pending
     against Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries in respect of any Tax.



                                     - 37 -
<PAGE>

          (v) No  issues  have  been  raised in any  examination  by any  taxing
     authority which, by application of similar principles,  reasonably could be
     expected to result in a material  proposed  deficiency for any other period
     not so examined.

          (vi) All Taxes that were  required  to be  collected  or  withheld  by
     Parent  or any of the  Parent  Subsidiaries  have been  duly  collected  or
     withheld,  and all such Taxes that Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries
     were  required to remit to any taxing  authority  have been duly  remitted,
     except  where  a  failure  to  collect,  withhold  or  remit  Taxes  is not
     reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

          (vii) Neither  Parent nor any of the Parent  Subsidiaries  is aware of
     any claim by any taxing  authority that Parent or any Parent  Subsidiary is
     required to include in income any adjustment pursuant to Section 481 of the
     Code (or  similar  provisions  of other law or  regulation)  by reason of a
     change  in  accounting  method,  nor  has  Parent  or  any  of  the  Parent
     Subsidiaries  received notice that the IRS (or other taxing  authority) has
     proposed,  or is considering,  any such change in accounting method. Parent
     has not taken any action that is not in accordance  with past practice that
     could defer a liability for Taxes of Parent from any taxable  period ending
     on or before the Closing Date to any taxable period ending after such date.

          (viii)  To the  knowledge  of  Parent,  after  review  of  appropriate
     documents  filed  with SEC,  Parent has no  foreign  stockholders  for whom
     shares of Parent Common Stock are United States real property  interests as
     defined in Section 897 of the Code.

          (ix)  Parent  and the  Parent  Subsidiaries  have  disclosed  on their
     respective  federal  income Tax Returns all  positions  taken  therein that
     could  give rise to a  substantial  understatement  of  federal  income Tax
     within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code.

          (x) There are no requests for rulings or  determinations in respect of
     any Tax pending between,  or in respect of, Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
     and any taxing authority.

          (xi) Neither Parent nor any of the Parent  Subsidiaries  has filed, or
     has had filed on its behalf,  a consent  under  Section  341(f) of the Code
     concerning collapsible corporations.



                                     - 38 -
<PAGE>

          (xii) Neither Parent nor any of the Parent  Subsidiaries  has made any
     payments,  is  obligated  to make  any  payments  or has  entered  into any
     agreements  under which  payment  would,  separately or in the aggregate in
     connection  with  this  Agreement  or any  change in  control  or any other
     circumstances,  result in a  nondeductible  expense to Parent or any of the
     Parent  Subsidiaries  pursuant to Section  162(m) or 280G of the Code or an
     excise tax to the recipient of such payment pursuant to Section 4999 of the
     Code.

          (xiii) There are no liens for Taxes (other than for current  Taxes not
     yet due and payable or for other  immaterial Taxes that are being contested
     in good faith) upon the assets of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary.

          (xiv) Neither Parent nor any Parent  Subsidiary is a party to or bound
     by any tax indemnity,  tax sharing or tax allocation  agreement (other than
     agreements  solely between  Parent and its direct or indirect  wholly-owned
     subsidiaries  or among  direct or  indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  of
     Parent).  Neither  Parent nor any Parent  Subsidiary  has any liability for
     Taxes of any person (other than Parent and the Parent  Subsidiaries)  under
     Treasury  Regulations  Section 1.1502-6 (or any corresponding  provision of
     state,  local or foreign  income Tax law), as  transferee or successor,  by
     contract or otherwise.

          (xv) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has been a "distributing
     corporation"   or  a  "controlled   corporation"   in  connection   with  a
     distribution  described  in  Section  355 of the Code  within  the past two
     years.

          (xvi) Neither Parent nor any Parent  Subsidiary has participated in or
     cooperated  with an  international  boycott as that term is used in Section
     999 of the Code.

          (xvii) Parent does not own directly any interests in any entities that
     are classified as partnerships for federal and state income Tax purposes.

     (b) All  persons  who  have at any time  been  classified  as  consultants,
independent  contractors or service  providers other than employees to Parent or
any  Parent  Subsidiary  (collectively,  the  "Parent  Consultants")  have  been
properly so classified  and excluded from the  classification  as an employee in
accordance with all Applicable Laws, including without limitation, ERISA and the
Code and in accordance with the terms of each Parent  Employee Plan.  Parent and
all Parent  Subsidiaries  have complied with all Applicable Laws with respect to
employment,  Taxes,  and tax reporting  associated with the Parent  Consultants,
except as is not reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 4.20 Intellectual Property. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries own,
or are  licensed or otherwise  possess  legally  enforceable  rights to use, all
patents,   trademarks,   trade  names,  service  marks,   copyrights,   and  any
applications  therefor,  technology,  know-how,  computer  software  programs or
applications,  and tangible or intangible  proprietary  information  or material
that are used in the business of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries as currently
conducted,  except as is not reasonably  likely to have,  individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION  4.21  Environmental   Matters.   Except  for  such  matters  that,
individually  or in the aggregate,  are not  reasonably  likely to have a Parent
Material  Adverse  Effect:  (a)  Parent  and the  Parent  Subsidiaries  have all
environmental  permits  which are  necessary  to enable  them to  conduct  their
businesses  as  they  are  currently  being  conducted   without  violating  any
Environmental Law, and Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have complied with all
their environmental permits and with all applicable  Environmental Laws; (b) the
properties  currently  owned or  operated  by  Parent or any  Parent  Subsidiary
(including soils, groundwater,  surface water, buildings or other structures) do
not contain  and, to  Parent's  knowledge,  have not  previously  contained  any
Hazardous Substances; (c) the properties formerly owned or operated by Parent or
any Parent  Subsidiary  did not contain  any  Hazardous  Substances  at any time
during the period of ownership or operation by Parent or the Parent  Subsidiary;
(d) neither  Parent nor any Parent  Subsidiary  has  disposed  of any  Hazardous
Substance  on any third party  property  which could  reasonably  be expected to
result in any  liability  under  Environmental  Law; (e) neither  Parent nor any
Parent  Subsidiary has released any Hazardous  Substance from any property owned
or operated by any of them which could  reasonably  be expected to result in any
liability under  Environmental Law; (f) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary
has  received  any  written  notice,   demand,  letter,  claim  or  request  for
information alleging that Parent or any Parent Subsidiary may be in violation of
or liable  under any  Environmental  Law;  (g)  neither  Parent  nor any  Parent
Subsidiary is a party to any orders, decrees, injunctions or agreements with any
Governmental  Entity or is a party to any indemnity or other  agreement with any
third party which is  expected  to result in  liability  on Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary  under  any  Environmental  Law;  (h)  there  are  no  circumstances,

property  now  owned  by  Parent  or  a  Parent   Subsidiary   pursuant  to  any
Environmental  Law; and (i) to the knowledge of Parent,  none of the  properties

     (b) For the period  beginning on the date of the initial public offering of
Parent  Common  Stock and  ending as of the date of this  Agreement,  Parent has
maintained  in full force and effect  general  liability  policies in respect of
such period which named Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, so long as they were
Parent Subsidiaries, as named insureds for the period of ownership by Parent and
which provided  coverage for,  among other  occurrences,  product  liability and
damages and  liabilities  arising  therefrom  in the minimum  insured  amount of
$10,000,000  and the  maximum  deductible  of  $50,000,  except  as set forth in
Section 4.23 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule.

     SECTION 4.24 Opinion of  Financial  Advisor.  The Parent Board has received
the opinion of Parent's financial advisor,  UBS Warburg LLC ("UBS Warburg"),  to
the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement,  the Merger  Consideration is
fair from a financial point of view to Parent.

     SECTION 4.25 Brokers. No broker, finder,  investment banker (other than UBS
Warburg) is entitled to any  brokerage,  finder's or other fee or  commission in
connection  with the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent.

     SECTION 4.26 Tax Treatment. Neither Parent nor, to the knowledge of Parent,
any of its  affiliates  has  taken  or  agreed  to take any  action,  nor to the
knowledge of Parent is there any fact or circumstance  relating to Parent,  that
would prevent the Merger from  constituting a reorganization  within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code.

     SECTION  4.27 Vote  Required.  At the  Parent  Stockholder  Meeting  or any
adjournment or postponement  thereof,  the affirmative  vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of the Parent Common Stock are the only votes
of the holders of any class or series of capital  stock of Parent  necessary  to
adopt this Agreement.

     SECTION 4.28 Parent Common Stock.  On the Closing Date,  Parent will have a
sufficient  number of authorized  but unissued or treasury  shares of the Parent
Common Stock  available  (i) for  issuance as the stock  component of the Merger
Consideration  set forth in Section 2.3 and (ii) for  issuance to the holders of
the Parent Stock Options issued  pursuant to this Agreement and  participants in
the  Parent  Stock  Purchase  Plan in  accordance  with the  provisions  of this
Agreement. The Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement will,
when so delivered, be (i) duly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable,
and (ii) listed on the NYSE, upon official notice of issuance.

     SECTION  4.29   Sufficient   Funds.   Parent  has  received  the  financing
commitments  attached on Section 4.29 of the Parent  Disclosure  Schedules  (the
"Commitments"). The Commitments are complete and correct copies of all financing
commitments received by Parent in connection with the transactions  contemplated
by this  Agreement.  To the  knowledge  of Parent,  no event has occurred and no
circumstances  currently  exist  that  would be likely  to cause the  conditions
precedent to obtaining the financing  referenced in the  Commitments  to fail to
occur or be fulfilled.  If the closing of the  transactions  contemplated by the
Commitment  occurs,  Parent  will have  available  to it at the  Effective  Time
sufficient funds to (i) pay the cash component of the Merger  Consideration  set
forth  in  Section  2.3(i)  and (ii)  repay  all of the  outstanding  principal,
interest and premium (if any) and discharge all other obligations of the Company
and each of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to (x) the Credit Agreement, dated

     (a) Except as provided in Section 4.20 of the Parent  Disclosure  Schedule,
Parent and the Parent  Subsidiaries  have for the period equal to the applicable
statute of  limitations,  and each  Parent  Subsidiary  has prior to  becoming a
subsidiary  of Parent  for the  longer  of (1) the  period  between  the date of
formation of such Parent Subsidiary and the date such Parent Subsidiary became a
subsidiary of Parent or (2) the applicable  statute of limitations,  provided to
each home  purchaser  from either  Parent or any Parent  Subsidiary a homeowners
warranty from Residential  Warranty  Corporation,  Homeowners' Warranty Company,
Two-Ten  Warranty  Company or United Home  Insurance  Company,  a Risk Retention
Company ("UHIC"), a Vermont corporation.

     (b) UHIC is in compliance with all Applicable Laws and  requirements of all
trade and industry  groups so as to provide  structural  warranties as to houses
and other  properties  conveyed  by Parent or the Parent  Subsidiaries  to third
parties in all markets where UHIC operates.  There are no claims pending against
UHIC or under homeowner warranty bonds issued by UHIC that are reasonably likely
to have,  either  individually  or in the  aggregate,  if paid by UHIC, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 4.31 Joint Ventures.  Neither Parent nor any Parent  Subsidiary has
any  direct   liability  or  liability  as  a  guarantor  with  respect  to  any
indebtedness   incurred  in  connection   with  any  joint  venture  or  similar
arrangement to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party.

                                   ARTICLE V.

     SECTION 5.2 No Solicitation.

     (a) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and
their respective officers, directors,  employees,  investment bankers, attorneys



                                     - 45 -
<PAGE>

and other  representatives  and agents to,  immediately cease any discussions or
negotiations with any parties with respect to any Third Party  Acquisition.  The
Company  shall  not,  nor shall the  Company  authorize  or permit  any  Company
Subsidiary or any of its or their  respective  officers,  directors,  employees,
investment bankers,  attorneys and other  representatives or agents to, directly
or indirectly,  encourage,  solicit,  participate in or initiate  discussions or
negotiations  with or provide any information to any person or group (other than
Parent or any designees of Parent) concerning, or take any other action designed
to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal concerning,  any Third
Party Acquisition;  provided, however, that (i) nothing herein shall prevent the
Company Board from  complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2  promulgated  under the
Exchange  Act with regard to any tender  offer or exchange  offer;  and (ii) the
Company may make inquiry of and  participate in  discussions  with any person or
group who has submitted  after the date hereof an unsolicited  and  unencouraged
Superior  Proposal if, and to the extent,  the Company  Board  determines in its
good faith  judgment,  that it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties,  after consultation with and advice from outside legal counsel
to such  effect  and,  before  making  such  inquiry  or  participating  in such
discussions,  it receives from such person or group an executed  confidentiality
agreement  with terms no less  favorable to the Company than those  contained in
the  Confidentiality  Letters  (as defined  herein),  which  agreement  does not
provide for any  payments by the Company.  The Company  shall  promptly  (but no
later than 24 hours after  receipt)  notify  Parent in the event it receives any
proposal or inquiry  concerning a Third Party  Acquisition,  including the terms
and conditions thereof and the identity of the party submitting such proposal or
inquiry (all in  reasonable  detail),  and shall advise  Parent  promptly of any
developments concerning the same and the status thereof.

     (b) Except as set forth in this Section 5.2(b), the Company Board shall not
withdraw or, in any manner adverse to Parent,  modify its  recommendation of the
transactions  contemplated hereby or approve or recommend,  or cause the Company
to enter  into any  agreement  with  respect  to, any Third  Party  Acquisition.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company Board determines in its good faith
judgment,  after consultation with and advice from outside legal counsel to such
effect,  that it is  necessary  to do so in order to comply  with its  fiduciary
duties,  the  Company  Board may  withdraw or modify its  recommendation  of the
transactions  contemplated  hereby or approve or recommend a Superior  Proposal,
but in each case only (i) after providing reasonable written notice to Parent (a
"Notice of  Superior  Proposal")  advising  Parent  that the  Company  Board has
received a Superior  Proposal,  specifying  the material terms and conditions of
such Superior  Proposal and identifying the person making such Superior Proposal
(all in  reasonable  detail) and (ii) if Parent does not,  within five  business
days of Parent's receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, make an offer which
the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with
a financial adviser of nationally  recognized  reputation) to provide as great a
value and to be as  favorable to the  Company's  stockholders  as such  Superior
Proposal;  provided,  however,  that the Company  shall not be entitled to enter


                                     - 46 -
<PAGE>

into any agreement  with respect to a Superior  Proposal until this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 7.1. Any disclosure that the Company Board
may be  compelled  to make with respect to the receipt of a proposal for a Third
Party  Acquisition  in order to comply with Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 of the  Exchange
Act will not constitute a violation of this Section  5.2(b);  provided that such
disclosure states that no action will be taken by the Company Board with respect
to the withdrawal or  modification  of its  recommendation  of the  transactions
contemplated  hereby  or the  approval  or  recommendation  of any  Third  Party
Acquisition except in accordance with this Section 5.2(b).

     (c) For the purposes of this Agreement, "Third Party Acquisition" means the
occurrence of any of the following events: (i) the acquisition of the Company by
merger or otherwise by any person (which,  for purposes of this Section  5.2(c),
includes a "person" as such term is defined in Section  13(d)(3) of the Exchange
Act) other than  Parent or any  affiliate  thereof (a "Third  Party");  (ii) the
acquisition  by a Third Party of all or a  substantial  portion of the assets of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole; (iii) the acquisition
by a Third  Party of an equity  interest  in the Company of more than 20% of the
outstanding  Company  Common  Stock  or the  acquisition  by a  Third  Party  of
securities  convertible  into more than 20% of the  outstanding  Company  Common
Stock  or  more  than  25%  of  the  outstanding  capital  stock  or  securities
convertible  into more than 25% of the outstanding  capital stock of any Company
Subsidiary (whether from the Company or any Company Subsidiary, by tender offer,
exchange  offer or  otherwise);  (iv) the  adoption  by the Company of a plan of
liquidation or the declaration or payment of an extraordinary  dividend; (v) the
repurchase  by the Company or any Company  Subsidiary  of a  significant  equity
interest in the Company or any Company  Subsidiary;  or (vi) any other  business
combination,  acquisition,  recapitalization,  restructuring  or  other  similar
transaction  involving  the Company or any Company  Subsidiary.  For purposes of
this Agreement,  a "Superior  Proposal" means any bona fide written  proposal to
acquire  directly  or  indirectly  for  consideration   consisting  of  cash  or
securities  more  than  66-2/3%  of the  voting  power of  Company  Shares  then
outstanding or all or substantially  all the assets of the Company and otherwise
on terms which the Company Board  determines in its good faith  judgment  (after
consulting with a financial adviser of nationally recognized  reputation) (1) to
be from a Third Party that is financially  capable of completing the transaction
subject to the proposal and (2) to provide (if  completed)  greater value and to
be more favorable to the Company's stockholders than the Merger.

     SECTION  5.3 Conduct of Business  by Parent.  Parent  covenants  and agrees
that, during the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Effective  Time,  unless the
Company  shall  otherwise  agree  in  writing,  which  agreement  shall  not  be
unreasonably  withheld or delayed,  Parent shall  conduct its business and shall
cause the businesses of the Parent  Subsidiaries to be conducted in the ordinary
course of business except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement. Except as
contemplated  by this  Agreement,  Parent shall not,  during the period from the
date of this  Agreement and continuing  until the earlier of the  termination of
this  Agreement or the  Effective  Time,  directly or  indirectly  do any of the
following without the prior written consent of the Company,  which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed:

Parent other than incident to a stock split or combination;

     (b) (i) declare,  set aside, make or pay any dividend or other distribution

dividends and any Parent Subsidiary may declare and pay a dividend to its parent

transactions if the shares so issued constitute more than 15% of the outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock (after giving effect to such issuance);

     (d) acquire (by merger,  consolidation  or  acquisition of stock or assets)
any corporation,  partnership or other business organization or division thereof
if the consideration therefor would exceed $150,000,000; and

     (e) take, or agree to take, any of the actions described in Sections 5.3(a)
through (c) above, or any action which would make any of the  representations or
warranties  of Parent  contained  in this  Agreement  untrue or incorrect in any
material  respect as  contemplated  hereby or prevent Parent from  performing or
cause Parent not to perform in any material respect its covenants hereunder.

     SECTION 5.4 Adverse Changes in Condition. Both the Company and Parent agree
to give  written  notice  promptly  to the  other  upon  becoming  aware  of the
occurrence  or impending  occurrence of any event or  circumstance  which (i) is
reasonably likely to have,  individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect, with respect to a Company notice to Parent, or a Parent Material
Adverse  Effect,  with  respect to a Parent  notice to the Company or (ii) would
constitute a material breach of any of the disclosing  party's  representations,
warranties or covenants contained herein.

                                  ARTICLE VI.

effectiveness  as long as is necessary to  consummate  the Merger.  Parent shall
promptly amend or supplement the Registration  Statement to the extent necessary
in order  to make the  statements  therein  not  misleading  or to  correct  any
statements  which have become false or  misleading.  Parent will use  reasonable

the Proxy  Statement  approved by the SEC under the  provisions  of the Exchange

     (c) The  information  specifically  designated  as  being  supplied  by the
Company  for  inclusion  or  incorporation  by  reference  in  the  Registration
Statement  shall  not,  at the  time  the  Registration  Statement  is  declared

     SECTION 6.4 Access to Information; Confidentiality

     (b) Upon  reasonable  notice  and  subject  to  restrictions  contained  in

Company  shall take or cause to be taken any  action on or before the  Effective
Time which would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization"  under

     SECTION 6.6 Affiliate Agreements.  The Company will use its best efforts to
cause each of its directors and executive  officers and each of its "affiliates"
(within the meaning of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) to execute and deliver
to Parent as soon as  practicable  an agreement in the form  attached  hereto as
Exhibit C, with respect to John B. Scheumann and Richard H. Crosser, and Exhibit

stock option  agreement  evidencing  such Parent Stock  Options  replacing  such
holders'  Company Stock Options as provided by Section 2.5 and this Section 6.7.
Parent shall use its reasonable  efforts to ensure,  to the extent  required by,
and subject to the provisions  of, such plan or agreements,  that the options to

Stock Options which  qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective

     (b) Parent  shall  take all  corporate  action  necessary  to  reserve  for
issuance a sufficient  number of shares of the Parent  Common Stock for delivery
upon exercise of the Parent Stock Options replacing the Company Stock Options in

the  effectiveness  of  a  registration  statement  or  registration  statements
covering  such options (and  maintain the current  status of the  prospectus  or
prospectuses  contained therein) for so long as such Parent Stock Options remain
outstanding.  Except  to the  extent  otherwise  agreed to by the  parties,  all
restrictions  or limitations on transfer and vesting with respect to the Company
Stock Options,  to the extent that such  restrictions  or limitations  shall not
have already  lapsed,  shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the
Parent Stock Options replacing the Company Stock Options as set forth above.

expenses  (including  reasonable  attorneys' fees),  judgments,  fines,  losses,
claims, damages and liabilities incurred in connection with, and amounts paid in
settlement of, any claim,  action,  suit,  proceeding or investigation,  whether


                                     - 53 -

civil, criminal,  administrative or investigative and wherever asserted, brought
or filed,  arising out of or pertaining to any acts or omissions or alleged acts
or omissions by them in their  capacities as such;  provided  that, as to claims
existing as of the Effective  Time, in no event shall the Surviving  Corporation
be obligated to provide  indemnification  under this Section 6.8(a) in excess of
the indemnification that the Company is required to provide to its directors and
officers  under its Articles of  Incorporation  or Bylaws as in effect as of the
date hereof.

     (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective  Time,  the Surviving
Corporation  shall  maintain  (through the  continuation  or  endorsement of the
Company's  existing  policy or the purchase of a "tail-end"  rider  permitted by
such policy) in effect,  if available,  the directors'  and officers'  liability
insurance  covering  those  persons who are  currently  covered by the Company's
directors' and officers'  liability insurance policy on the terms (including the
amounts of coverage and the amounts of  deductibles,  if any) now  applicable to
them;  provided that in no event shall the Surviving  Corporation be required to
spend in excess of 200% of the annual premium  currently paid by the Company for
such  coverage,  and provided  further  that,  if the premium for such  coverage
exceeds such  amount,  the  Surviving  Corporation  shall  maintain the greatest
coverage  available  for an annual  amount  equal to 200% of the annual  premium
currently paid by the Company for such coverage.

     (c) This Section 6.8 shall  survive the  consummation  of the Merger at the
Effective  Time, is intended to benefit the Company,  the Surviving  Corporation
and the Indemnified  Parties,  shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
the Surviving  Corporation and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified  Parties.
In the event that the Surviving  Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i)  consolidates or merges into any other person or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or
(ii)  transfers all or  substantially  all of its  properties  and assets to any
person or entity, then and in such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the  successors  and assigns of the Surviving  Corporation  (as the case may be)
assume the  obligations of the Surviving  Corporation  set forth in this Section
6.8.

     SECTION 6.9 Further  Action.  Upon the terms and subject to the  conditions
hereof,  each of the parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to take, or

timely  manner all material  waivers,  consents and  approvals and to effect all
necessary  registrations  and filings,  and  otherwise to satisfy or cause to be
satisfied in all material  respects all conditions  precedent to its obligations
under this Agreement.

     SECTION 6.10 Public Announcements. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
consult  with each other  before  issuing any press  release with respect to the
Merger or this  Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement without the prior consent of the other party,  which shall
not be unreasonably  withheld or delayed;  provided,  however, that a party may,
without the prior  consent of the other party,  issue such press release or make
such  public  statement  as may upon the advice of counsel be required by law or
the rules and  regulations  of the NYSE,  in the case of Parent  and the  Nasdaq
Stock Market in the case of the Company if it has used all reasonable efforts to
consult with the other party.

     SECTION 6.11 Employee Benefits.

     (a) At the written  request of Parent,  which request shall be delivered to
the Company not less than 10 days before the  Closing  Date,  the Company  shall
cause any defined  contribution  plan  (within  the meaning of Section  3(34) of
ERISA) maintained by it or any Company Subsidiary to be terminated  ("Terminated
Plan") no later than the day  immediately  preceding  the Closing Date and cause
all  participants  under such Terminated  Plan to become fully vested,  with the
assets of such Terminated  Plan being  distributed at the direction of Parent or
its designee as soon as practicable  after receipt of a  determination  in which
the Internal Revenue Service  confirms that the plan is  tax-qualified  upon its
termination.  Until  such  time  as the  assets  of  such  Terminated  Plan  are
distributed to participants,  Parent shall permit participants in the Terminated
Plan to continue  making loan  repayments  for plan loans  outstanding as of the
Closing  Date to the  extent  consistent  with  the  terms of the Plan as of the
Closing Date.

     (b) Each  employee of the Company or a Company  Subsidiary at the Effective
Time who becomes an employee immediately  following the Effective Time of Parent
or a  subsidiary  of  Parent  ("Employer  Entity")  (with  such  employee  being
considered  "Transferred Employee") shall be eligible to participate in Parent's
401(k) plan (subject to complying with eligibility  requirements and to Parent's
right to terminate  such plan).  Notwithstanding  the preceding  sentence,  each
Transferred  Employee who was a  participant  in any defined  contribution  plan
(within  the  meaning of Section  3(34) of ERISA)  maintained  by Company or any
Company  Subsidiary  immediately  preceding  the  Closing  Date  shall  become a
participant in the Parent's  401(k) plan as of the Effective  Time. For purposes
of administering  Parent's 401(k) plan, service with the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries  shall  be  deemed  to be  service  with  Parent  or  the  Parent's
subsidiaries for  participation,  vesting,  and for purposes of benefit accrual.
The Parent's 401(k) plan shall accept eligible rollover distributions within the
meaning of Section 402(c) of the Code from any defined contribution plan (within
the meaning of Section 3(34) of ERISA)  maintained by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

     (b) (c) With respect to any medical,  dental,  life,  disability  and other
welfare  benefit  plans and programs  available to employees of the Company or a
Company Subsidiary at the Effective Time who are Transferred  Employees that the
Employer Entity determines, in good faith, provides benefits of the same type or
class as a corresponding  plan or program maintained by the Employer Entity, the
Employer  Entity shall  continue  such Company plan or program in effect for the
benefit of the  Transferred  Employees  until such date as the  Employer  Entity
determines in its sole discretion,  but in no event effective as of a date later
than the  January 1  immediately  following  the Closing  Date,  that they shall
become eligible to participate in the corresponding  plan or program  maintained
by the Employer Entity (and,  with respect to any such plan or program,  subject
to  complying  with  eligibility  requirements  and  subject to the right of the
Employer   Entity  to  terminate   such  plan  or  program).   For  purposes  of
administering  each such  plan or  program,  service  with the  Company  and the
Company  Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be service with the Employer Entity for
the purpose of determining eligibility to participate,  vesting (if applicable),
and benefit  accrual in such  welfare  plans and  programs.  With respect to any
Parent Employee Plan that is a "group health plan" within the meaning of Section
5000(b)(1) of the Code and that is offered to Transferred  Employees at any time
prior to the  January 1  immediately  following  the Closing  Date,  such Parent
Employee Plan shall grant such  Transferred  Employees credit for all deductible
amounts, co-payment amounts and other out-of-pocket expenses credited to or paid
by such  Transferred  Employee under the terms of any Company Employee Plan that
was a "group  health plan" within the meaning of Section  5000(b)(1) of the Code
as of the Closing  Date  (including  periods of time during  which such plan was
maintained following the Closing Date).

          (ii) if the Merger shall not have been  consummated  on or before July

     willful  and  material  breach of this  Agreement  by the party  seeking to
     terminate this Agreement;



                                     - 56 -

     or  administrative  agency or commission  shall have issued a nonappealable
     final order,  decree or ruling or taken any other action  having the effect
     of permanently  restraining,  enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger
     (provided  that the right to terminate  this  Agreement  under this Section
     7.1(b)(iii)  shall not be available to any party who has not complied  with
     its  obligations  under  Section  6.9  and  such  noncompliance  materially
     contributed  to the  issuance  of any such  order,  decree or ruling or the
     taking of such action);

          (iv) in the  event of a  material  breach  by the  other  party of any
     representation,  warranty,  covenant or other  agreement  contained in this
     Agreement (a "Terminating  Breach") (provided that the terminating party is
     not then in material breach of any  representation,  warranty,  covenant or
     other agreement contained in this Agreement); provided that, in the case of
     a  covenant  or  agreement,  if such  Terminating  Breach is curable by the
     Company  or  Parent,  as the  case  may be,  through  the  exercise  of its
     reasonable  efforts and for so long as the  Company or Parent,  as the case
     may be, continues to exercise such reasonable  efforts,  neither Parent nor
     the Company,  respectively, may terminate this Agreement under this Section
     7.1(b)(iv) unless such Terminating Breach is not cured within 15 days after
     the giving of written notice to the Company or Parent, as applicable; or

          (v) if,  upon a vote at a duly held  meeting  of  stockholders  or any
     adjournment  thereof,  any  required  approval of the holders of the Parent
     Common Stock shall not have been obtained;

     (c)  notwithstanding  the other provisions of this Section 7.1, as provided
in Section 7.2(d);

     (d) by Parent if the Company Board shall have  recommended to the Company's
stockholders a Superior Proposal;  or the Company Board shall have withdrawn or,
in a manner adverse to Parent,  modified its recommendation of this Agreement or
the Merger;  provided that any disclosure that the Company Board is compelled to
make of the  receipt of a proposal  for a Third  Party  Acquisition  in order to
comply  with  Rule  14d-9 or 14e-2  shall not in and of  itself  constitute  the
withdrawal or modification of the Company Board's recommendation,  provided that
such  disclosure  states that no action will be taken by the Company  Board with
respect  to  the  withdrawal  or  modification  of  its  recommendation  of  the
transactions  contemplated hereby or the approval or recommendation of any Third
Party Acquisition except in accordance with Section 5.2(b);

     (e) by the Company if the Company  Board has received a Superior  Proposal,
the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with
and advice from outside legal counsel, that it is necessary to do so in order to
comply with its fiduciary  duties,  withdraws or, in a manner adverse to Parent,
modifies its  recommendation of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement
or approves or  recommends  such  Superior  Proposal,  and the Company Board has
complied with all other provisions of Section 5.2(b) and Section 7.2(a); and

Company of the Company's  election to terminate this Agreement  pursuant to this
Section 7.1(f) Parent elects, by notice to the Company to establish the Adjusted

in the event of  termination  of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, this
Agreement shall immediately  become void and of no force or effect,  without any
liability  or  obligation  on the part of any  party,  unless  such  termination
results  from  the  willful  and  material  breach  by a  party  of  any  of its
representations and warranties,  covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement,  in which  case the  terminating  party  shall  retain its rights and
remedies  against  such other  party in respect  of such other  party's  breach.

is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the  economic or legal  substance  of
the  transactions  contemplated  hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to

good faith to modify this  Agreement so as to effect the original  intent of the
