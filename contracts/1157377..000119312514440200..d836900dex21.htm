accountants of Purchaser shall not be obligated to make any working papers available to Seller unless Seller has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such
access to working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants. If the Seller has any objections to the Preliminary Closing Statement, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser a statement setting forth its
objections thereto (an &#147;<U>Objections Statement</U>&#148;). If an Objections Statement is not delivered to the Purchaser within 30 days after delivery of the Preliminary Closing Statement, the Preliminary Closing Statement shall be final,
binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto. The Seller and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objections, but if they do not reach a final resolution within 15 days after the delivery of the Objections Statement,
the Seller and the Purchaser shall submit such dispute to KPMG LLP or such other mutually acceptable dispute resolution firm (the &#147;<U>Dispute Resolution Firm</U>&#148;). Any further submissions to the Dispute Resolution Firm must be written and
delivered to each party to the dispute. The Dispute Resolution Firm shall consider only those items and amounts which are identified in the Objections Statement as being items which the Seller and the Purchaser are unable to resolve. The Dispute
Resolution Firm&#146;s determination will be based solely on the definitions of Net Working Capital, Cash on Hand, Indebtedness and Seller Transaction Expenses, as applicable, contained in this Agreement and in the Statement of Accounting Principles
attached hereto as <U>Schedule 9.01(b)</U>. The Seller and the Purchaser shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Dispute Resolution Firm (who shall be acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator) to resolve all disagreements as
soon as practicable and in any event within 60 days after the submission of any dispute. Further, the Dispute Resolution Firm&#146;s determination shall be based solely on the submissions by the Purchaser and the Seller which are in accordance with
the terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement and in the Statement of Accounting Principles attached hereto as <U>Schedule 9.01(b)</U> (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review). Purchaser and Seller will cooperate with the Dispute
Resolution Firm during the term of its engagement. The resolution of the dispute by the Dispute Resolution Firm shall be final, binding and non-appealable on the parties hereto and their Affiliates. The costs and expenses of the Dispute Resolution
Firm shall be allocated based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by such party in the presentation to the Dispute Resolution Firm. For example, if the Seller
submits an Objections Statement for $1,000, and if the Purchaser contests only $500 of the amount claimed by the Seller, and if the Dispute Resolution Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Seller $300 of the $500 contested, then the
costs and expenses of the Dispute Resolution Firm will be allocated 60% (i.e. 300/500) to the Purchaser and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to the Seller. </P>
