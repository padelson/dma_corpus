v STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of December 10,
2014, is made by and among The Advisory Board Company, a Delaware corporation
(the " _Purchaser_ "), Royall Acquisition Co., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "), and Royall Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(the " _Seller_ "). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein
have the meanings set forth in _Article IX_ below.

 

WHEREAS, the Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
the Company; and

 

WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Purchaser
desires to purchase from the Seller, and the Seller desires to sell to the
Purchaser, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE SHARES

1.01 _Purchase and Sale of the Shares_. On and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the Seller shall sell, assign,
transfer and convey to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase and
acquire from the Seller, all of the Shares, free and clear of all Liens (other
than Permitted Liens), for the consideration specified below in this _Article
I_.

1.02 _Estimated Cash Purchase Price and Stock Consideration_. The aggregate
consideration for the purchase and sale of the Shares pursuant to this
Agreement will be (a) an amount of cash equal to (i) seven hundred fifty
million dollars ($750,000,000), _plus_ (ii) the amount by which Estimated Net
Working Capital exceeds Target Working Capital (or _minus_ the amount by
which Target Working Capital exceeds Estimated Net Working Capital), _plus_
(iii) the total amount of Estimated Cash on Hand, _minus_ (iv) the outstanding
amount of Estimated Indebtedness, _minus_ (v) the unpaid Estimated Seller
Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Cash Purchase Price_ ") and (b) the
Stock Consideration. The Estimated Cash Purchase Price will be subject
to adjustment after the Closing pursuant to _Section 1.05_.

1.03 _The Closing_.

 

(a) The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP located
at 300 North LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois at 10:00 a.m. on the third
business day following full satisfaction or due waiver of all of the closing
conditions set forth in _Article II_ hereof (other than those to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction of those conditions)
or on such other date  as is mutually agreeable to the Purchaser and the Seller; provided, however,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any party hereto be
required to effect the Closing prior to January 6, 2015. The date and time of
the Closing are referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_." By mutual
agreement of the parties, the Closing may take place by conference call and
electronic (i.e., email/pdf) or facsimile exchange of documents.

1.04 _The Closing Transactions_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, the parties hereto shall consummate the following
transactions (the " _Closing Transactions_ ") on the Closing Date:

 

(i) the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser (A) all of the stock
certificates evidencing the Shares duly endorsed for transfer or accompanied
by duly executed stock powers or other forms of assignment and transfer and
(B) all books and records and other property of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in Sellers possession or under Sellers control;

(ii) the Purchaser shall (A) deliver to the Seller an amount in cash equal to
(x) the Estimated Cash Purchase Price _minus_ (y) the Working Capital Escrow
Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s)
designated by the Seller (which account(s) shall be designated by the Seller
to the Purchaser in writing at least two business days before the Closing
Date) and (B) issue or transfer, or cause to be issued or transferred, to the
Seller the number of Purchaser Shares payable as the Stock Consideration
pursuant to the terms hereof, which may be represented by one or more
certificates at the Purchasers election;

(iii) the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser appropriate evidence of
releases of any Liens (other than any Permitted Liens) related to the assets
and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries and payoff letters with
respect to any Indebtedness set forth on the _Indebtedness Payoff Schedule_
outstanding as of the Closing (in each case in a form reasonably satisfactory
to the Purchaser);

(iv) the Purchaser shall repay, or cause to be repaid, on behalf of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, all amounts necessary to discharge fully the
then outstanding balance of the Indebtedness (as set forth on the
_Indebtedness Payoff Schedule_  delivered by Seller or the Company to
Purchaser at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by the
holders of such Indebtedness;

 

(v) the Purchaser shall repay, or cause to be repaid, on behalf of the Seller,
the Company and its Subsidiaries, all amounts necessary to discharge fully
the then outstanding balance of all Seller Transaction Expenses, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, to the account(s) designated by each
Person to whom such Seller Transaction Expenses are to be paid and delivered
in writing by Seller or the Company to Purchaser at least two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date;

 

(vi) the Purchaser shall deliver the Working Capital Escrow Amount by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Escrow Agent;

 



2 (vii) each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall deliver, or cause to
be delivered, a duly executed copy of the Registration Rights Agreement; and

(viii) the Purchaser and the Seller shall make such other deliveries as are
required by _Article II_ hereof.

1.05 _Purchase Price Adjustments_.

 

(a) At least two business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to the Purchaser a good faith estimate of Net Working Capital (the "
_Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), Cash on Hand (the " _Estimated Cash on
Hand_ "), Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Indebtedness_ ") and Seller
Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses_ ") and
the resulting calculation of the Estimated Cash Purchase Price as set forth in
_Section 1.02_. The Estimated Cash Purchase Price shall be prepared using the
accounting principles set forth on the Statement of Accounting Principles
attached as _Schedule 9.01(b)_ hereto.

(b) As promptly as possible, but in any event within 75 days after the
Closing Date, the Purchaser will deliver to the Seller (i) a consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Closing Balance
Sheet_ ") and (ii) a statement showing the Purchasers calculation of Net
Working Capital, Cash on Hand, Indebtedness and Seller Transaction Expenses,
and the resulting calculation of the Final Cash Purchase Price (together with
the Closing Balance Sheet, the " _Preliminary Closing Statement_ "). The
Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with the definitions set
forth in this Agreement and using the accounting principles set forth on the
Statement of Accounting Principles attached as _Schedule 9.01(b)_ hereto. The
parties agree that the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and
determining Net Working Capital, Cash on Hand, Indebtedness, Seller
Transaction Expenses and the related purchase price adjustments contemplated
by this _Section 1.05(b)_ is to measure changes in Net Working Capital and
the levels of Cash on Hand, Indebtedness and Seller Transaction Expenses, and
such processes are not intended to permit the introduction of different
judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures,
classifications or estimation methodologies as those set forth on the
Statement of Accounting Principles attached as _Schedule 9.01(b)_ hereto.
Seller shall, prior to the Closing, and Purchaser shall, following the
Closing through the date that the Final Cash Purchase Price is finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 1.05(b)_, take all actions reasonably
necessary to maintain and preserve copies of all accounting books and
records, policies and procedures on which each of the determination of the
Estimated Cash Purchase Price and the Preliminary Closing Statement are based.
During the thirty (30) days after delivery of the Preliminary
Closing Statement and during any period of dispute with respect thereto
thereafter, the Purchaser shall give the Seller and its accountants reasonable
access to review the Companys and its Subsidiaries books and records and
work papers related to the preparation of the Preliminary Closing Statement
(and, solely to the extent relevant thereto, to the Purchasers books and
records and work papers) for purposes of Sellers review of the Preliminary
Closing Statement. The Seller and its accountants may make inquiries of the
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries and their respective accountants regarding
questions concerning or disagreements with the Preliminary Closing Statement
arising in the course of its review thereof, and the Purchaser shall use its,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use their, commercially reasonable efforts
to cause any such accountants to provide reasonable cooperation with and
reasonably promptly respond to such inquiries; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the independent

 



3  accountants of Purchaser shall not be obligated to make any working papers
available to Seller unless Seller has signed a customary confidentiality and
hold harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants. If the Seller
has any objections to the Preliminary Closing Statement, the Seller shall
deliver to the Purchaser a statement setting forth its objections thereto (an
" _Objections Statement_ "). If an Objections Statement is not delivered to
the Purchaser within 30 days after delivery of the Preliminary Closing
Statement, the Preliminary Closing Statement shall be final, binding and non-
appealable by the parties hereto. The Seller and the Purchaser shall negotiate
in good faith to resolve any such objections, but if they do not reach a final
resolution within 15 days after the delivery of the Objections Statement, the
Seller and the Purchaser shall submit such dispute to KPMG LLP or such other
mutually acceptable dispute resolution firm (the " _Dispute Resolution Firm_
"). Any further submissions to the Dispute Resolution Firm must be written
and delivered to each party to the dispute. The Dispute Resolution Firm shall
consider only those items and amounts which are identified in the Objections
Statement as being items which the Seller and the Purchaser are unable to
resolve. The Dispute Resolution Firms determination will be based solely on
the definitions of Net Working Capital, Cash on Hand, Indebtedness and Seller
Transaction Expenses, as applicable, contained in this Agreement and in the
Statement of Accounting Principles attached hereto as _Schedule 9.01(b)_. The
Seller and the Purchaser shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Dispute Resolution Firm (who shall be acting as an expert and not as
an arbitrator) to resolve all disagreements as soon as practicable and in any
event within 60 days after the submission of any dispute. Further, the Dispute
Resolution Firms determination shall be based solely on the submissions by
the Purchaser and the Seller which are in accordance with the terms and
procedures set forth in this Agreement and in the Statement of Accounting
Principles attached hereto as _Schedule 9.01(b)_ (i.e., not on the basis of an
independent review). Purchaser and Seller will cooperate with the
Dispute Resolution Firm during the term of its engagement. The resolution of
the dispute by the Dispute Resolution Firm shall be final, binding and non-
appealable on the parties hereto and their Affiliates. The costs and expenses
of the Dispute Resolution Firm shall be allocated based upon the percentage
which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to
the amount actually contested by such party in the presentation to the Dispute
Resolution Firm. For example, if the Seller submits an Objections Statement
for $1,000, and if the Purchaser contests only $500 of the amount claimed by
the Seller, and if the Dispute Resolution Firm ultimately resolves the dispute
by awarding the Seller $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and
expenses of the Dispute Resolution Firm will be allocated 60% (i.e. 300/500)
to the Purchaser and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to the Seller.

 

For purposes hereof, " _Final Cash Purchase Price_ " (which, for the avoidance
of doubt, does not include the Stock Consideration) means an aggregate amount
as finally determined in accordance with this _Section 1.05(b)_ equal to (i)
seven hundred fifty million dollars ($750,000,000), _plus_ (ii) the amount by
which Net Working Capital exceeds Target Working Capital (or _minus_ the
amount by which Target Working Capital exceeds Net Working Capital), _plus_
(iii) the total amount of Cash on Hand, _minus_ (iv) the outstanding amount of
Indebtedness,  _minus_ (v) the unpaid Seller Transaction Expenses, in each
case, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 1.05(b)_, as
applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, the Stock Consideration paid by
Purchaser to Seller in accordance with _Section 1.04_ shall not be subject
to any adjustment pursuant to this _Section 1.05_ or any other section hereof
except, if applicable, in accordance with _Section 6.09_.

 



4 (c) _Post-Closing Adjustment Payment_.

 

(i) If the Final Cash Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Cash
Purchase Price, the Purchaser shall promptly (but in any event within five
business days after the determination of the Final Cash Purchase Price in
accordance with _Section 1.05(b)_) deliver to the Seller the amount of such
excess by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated by the Seller. Immediately following payment of any
amounts determined pursuant to _Section 1.05(b)_ and this _Section
1.05(c)(i)_ to be owing to the Seller, the Seller and the Purchaser shall
deliver joint instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent
to pay to the Seller all remaining funds in the Working Capital Escrow
Account, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 

(ii) If the Final Cash Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Cash Purchase
Price, the Seller and the Purchaser shall promptly (but in any event within
five business days after the determination of the Final Cash Purchase Price in
accordance with _Section 1.05(b)_) deliver joint instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay from the Working Capital Escrow
Account to an account or accounts designed by the Purchaser the amount of such
shortfall by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated by the Purchaser. Immediately following payment of any
amounts determined pursuant to _Section 1.05(b)_ and this _Section
1.05(c)(ii)_ to be owing to the Purchaser, the Seller and the Purchaser shall
deliver joint instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
pay to the Seller all remaining funds in the Working Capital Escrow Account,
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Working Capital
Escrow Account shall be the Purchasers sole recourse with respect to, and the
exclusive source of funds for, any payments required to be made by the Seller
pursuant to _Section 1.05(b)_ and this _Section 1.05(c)_.

1.06 Withholding. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser or its designee and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be
entitled to withhold and deduct from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Purchaser or its designee or the
Company and its Subsidiaries are required by law to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, applicable Treasury
Regulations or any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law;
_provided_ that, if the Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
determines that an amount is required to be deducted and withheld, at least
five (5) Business Days prior to the date the applicable payment is scheduled
to be made, the Purchaser (i) shall provide the Seller with written notice of
the intent to deduct and withhold, which shall include a copy of the
calculation of the amount to be deducted and withheld and any applicable
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law pursuant to which such deduction
and withholding is required and (ii) shall provide the recipient of such
payment a reasonable opportunity to provide forms or other evidence that would
exempt such amounts from withholding. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax authority, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person

Cash Purchase Price and repayment of all of the Indebtedness set forth on
_Indebtedness Payoff Schedule_ , on the terms contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) Purchaser has delivered to Company a complete and accurate copy, as of the
date hereof, of one or more executed commitment letters, dated as of the date
hereof (the " _Debt Commitment Financing Letters_ "), from the lenders party
thereto who have agreed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions
therein, debt financing (the " _Debt Financing_ ") in an aggregate amount set
forth therein, which amounts, together with Purchasers cash on hand, are
sufficient to pay the Final Cash Purchase Price and repay all of the
Indebtedness set forth on _Indebtedness Payoff Schedule_ , and copies of
any fee letters (in redacted form) related to the Debt Financing
(collectively, the " _Fee Letters_ ").

(c) As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Financing Letters have not
been amended or modified, supplemented, restated or replaced, and the
commitments set forth in the Debt Commitment Financing Letters have not been
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, the Debt
Commitment Financing Letters, in the form so delivered to Seller on the date

(d) Assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 2.01_ and
_Section 2.02_, Purchaser does not have any reason to believe as of the date
of this Agreement that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions to be satisfied by it in any of the Debt Commitment Financing
Letters or the Fee Letters at the time it is required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, nor does Purchaser have
knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement, that any of the lenders party to
the Debt Commitment Financing Letters will not perform their respective
funding obligations under the Debt Financing Commitment Letters in accordance
with their respective terms and conditions.

 



31 (e) Purchaser has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees

in all material respects, and after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, at and immediately after the Closing Date,

reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities), (b) such
Person shall be able to pay its debts as they mature or become due; and (c)
such Person and each of its Subsidiaries shall have adequate capital and
liquidity to carry on their respective businesses. As used herein, "assets,"
"debts" and "liabilities" shall include and assume the full funding of the
amounts contemplated by the Debt Commitment Financing Letters.

independent investigation and analysis in entering into the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Purchaser is knowledgeable about the industries in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate and is capable of evaluating

is able to bear the substantial economic risk of such investment for an
indefinite period of time. The Purchaser has been afforded access to books and
records, facilities and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries
for purposes of conducting a due diligence investigation and has conducted a
due diligence investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries to its
satisfaction.

stock appreciation rights, performance units, contingent value rights,
"phantom" stock or similar securities or rights issued or granted by the
Purchaser that are derivative of, or provide economic benefits based,
directly or indirectly, on the value or price of, any shares of capital stock
or other voting securities of or other ownership interests in the Purchaser or
(iv) outstanding obligations of the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Purchaser Common Stock.

4.12 Purchaser Shares. Upon issuance, the Purchaser Shares will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and will not be
subject to any option, call, preemptive, subscription or similar rights or
Liens other than restrictions on transfer imposed by state and federal
securities laws. The Purchaser is eligible to register the resale of the
Purchaser Shares on Form S-3. Subject to the accuracy of the representations
set forth in _Section 3.23_, the Purchaser Shares will be issued to Seller in
compliance with applicable exemptions from (A) the registration and

than Permitted Liens); (F) make any capital investment in, or any capital
contribution or loan or advance to, or guaranty for the benefit of, any other
Person; (G) make any capital expenditures or commitments therefor in excess of
$150,000, except for such capital expenditures or commitments therefor that
are reflected in the Companys budget for the fiscal year ending June 30,

directors, officers, and employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
outside the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; (I)
incur any Indebtedness (other than to the extent the amount incurred is set
forth on the  _Indebtedness Payoff Schedule_ ), except in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice; or (J) take or omit to take any
action, except as required by applicable Law, that would have required
disclosure under _Sections 3.06(d)_ , _(g)_ , _(j)_ , _(k)_ , _(l)_ , _(m)
(o)_ or _(p)_. Without limiting the scope of covenants of Seller and the
Company set forth in this _Section 5.01_, the parties acknowledge and agree
that (x) nothing contained in this _Section 5.01_ is intended to give
Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to direct the control or
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, (y)
prior to the Closing, subject to this _Section 5.01_, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over the operations of it and its Subsidiaries, and
(z) notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
consent of Purchaser shall be required with respect to any matter set forth in
this _Section 5.01_ to the extent the requirement to obtain such consent
would, upon written advice of Sellers counsel, violate any applicable Law.

 



35 5.02 _Access to Books and Records_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
from the date hereof until the Closing Date, Seller, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Seller shall cause the Company to) provide the
Purchaser and its authorized Representatives (the " _Purchaser s
Representatives_") with full access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice to the offices, properties, books and records of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to the extent relating to the transition of the Companys
business to Purchaser; _provided_  that (a) such access shall not materially
and unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and (b) nothing herein shall require the
Company and its Subsidiaries to provide access to, or to disclose any
information to, the Purchaser if such access or disclosure would be reasonably
likely to (i) waive any legal privilege or (ii) be in violation of applicable
Law or the provisions of any agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement and to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party. The Purchaser
acknowledges that it remains bound by the Confidentiality Agreement, dated
September 12, 2014 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and that all
information it obtains as a result of access under this _Section 5.02_ shall
be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any assistance or access related to or in connection with the Debt Financing
(including delivery of financial information and statements, accounting and
Tax-related records and working papers and data in the possession of the
Company and its Subsidiaries) shall be governed exclusively by  _Section
8.07_.

5.03 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the Closing Date and for a period of three (3) years thereafter,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and their representative to,
treat as confidential and safeguard any and all information, knowledge or data
relating to the Business that is known to Seller or such Affiliate(s) of
Seller (the " _Confidential Information_ ") except as otherwise agreed by
Purchaser.

(b) Purchaser, Seller and the Company acknowledge and agree that "Confidential
Information" shall not include information, knowledge and data that (i) is
publicly available or becomes publicly available except as a result of a
breach by the Seller of this Agreement, (ii) becomes available to Seller on a
non-confidential basis from a source other than the party owing a duty of
confidentiality so long as such source is not known by Seller to be bound by a
confidentiality agreement with or other obligations of secrecy to the Company,
(iii) is independently developed by Seller without reliance on confidential
information, or (iv) is required by applicable Law to be disclosed, provided
that Seller shall promptly inform the Purchaser of any such requirement,
disclose no more information than is so required and cooperate with all
attempts by the Purchaser to obtain a protective order or similar treatment
(at the Purchasers sole cost and expense).

 

(c) In the event of a breach of the obligations under this _Section 5.03_ by
Seller, Purchaser shall, in addition to all other available remedies, be
entitled to injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of this _Section
5.03_ in any court of competent jurisdiction.

 

5.04 _Conditions_. Subject to the terms of the covenants in _Section 8.05_,
the Seller and the Company shall (and Seller shall cause the Company to) use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions set forth in _Section
2.01_ to be satisfied and to consummate the transactions contemplated herein
as soon as reasonably possible after the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in _Article II_ (other than those to be satisfied at the Closing).

 



36 5.05 _Exclusive Dealing_. During the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.01_, neither the Company nor the Seller shall (and Seller and the
Company shall cause their respective Representatives not to), directly or
indirectly, take any action to encourage, initiate or engage in discussions
or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person (other than
the Purchaser and the Purchasers Representatives) concerning any purchase of
the Shares or any merger, sale of substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or similar transactions involving the Company and
its Subsidiaries (other than assets sold in the ordinary course of business).
Seller and the Company shall notify Purchaser in writing immediately if any
Person makes any proposal, offer, inquiry or contact with respect to any of
the foregoing, such notice to include the material terms of any such proposal
or other inquiry. The Seller agrees that, during the period from the date
hereof to the earlier of the Closing and the date that this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Article VII_ , it will not, directly or
indirectly, sell, transfer, dispose or otherwise convey ownership of, or legal
right or entitlement to, any of the Shares. Any sale, transfer, disposition
or other conveyance in violation of this _Section 5.05_ shall be null and
void. The Company agrees that it will not record in the stock register or
other books and records of the Company any transfer in violation of this
_Section 5.05_.

5.06 _Notification_. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company
shall promptly notify the Purchaser if Seller or the Company obtains knowledge
of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which (i) results in any of the representations or warranties
contained in _Article III_ or _Article IIIA_ being untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect (or, in the case of any representation or warranty qualified
by its terms by materiality, including the words "material" or "Company
Material Adverse Effect", then untrue or inaccurate in any respect) or (ii)
would be reasonably likely to cause any of the conditions set forth in
_Section 2.01_ to be incapable of satisfaction, and (b) any breach of, or
failure to comply in any material respect with, any covenant of Seller or the
Company hereunder. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.06_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event will the Companys
requirements set forth in this _Section 5.06_ be used by Purchaser as a basis
for a claim of breach by the Company or a failure to comply with a closing
condition of Purchaser unless the Company acts in bad faith and willfully
fails to comply in a material respect with its obligations pursuant to this
_Section 5.06_, which failure has not been cured within ten (10) Business
Days from receipt of a written notice from Purchaser specifying in reasonable
detail such failure.

5.07 _280G Approval_. The Company shall promptly seek approval, to the
extent required by and in a manner that complies with Section 280G(b)(5)(B)
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, of the right
of any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code)
to receive or retain any payments that could, in the absence of such
approval, constitute "excess parachute payments" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code); _provided_ that, at least ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall provide a detailed list and copy of any
agreement, contract, arrangement or

 



37  Benefit Plan that Purchaser or its Affiliates are providing or entering into
prior to the Closing with any disqualified individual in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby that could be treated as a "parachute
payment" (either alone or together with any other payments to a disqualified
individual). Prior to seeking such approval, the Company shall seek waivers
from the intended recipients of such payments in which case, unless approved
to the extent required by and in the manner that complies with Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder,
neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to make such
waived payments. Within a reasonable period of time prior to seeking any
waiver or approval, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser drafts of all
waivers, consents, disclosures, and other documents prepared in connection
with the actions described in this _Section 5.07_, and the Company shall
consider in good faith any reasonable comments from Purchaser to such
documents. Notwithstanding the above, in no event shall this _Section 5.07_
be construed to require the Company or its Affiliates to compel any Person to
waive any existing rights under any contract or agreement that such Person has
with the Company or any Subsidiary thereof or the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates and in no event shall the Company be deemed in breach of this
_Section 5.07_ if any such Person refuses to waive any such rights or if the
stockholder approval is not obtained.

 

ARTICLE VI

 

COVENANTS OF THE PURCHASER

 

6.01 _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing, the Purchaser
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, provide the Seller and
its authorized representatives with reasonable access upon reasonable advance
notice, during normal business hours, to the books and records of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (relating to the Business) necessary to implement the
provisions of, or to investigate, prosecute or defend, any Claims between the
parties arising under this Agreement other than, in the case of Claims between
the parties, any information that is subject to any attorney-client, work
product or other privilege or that otherwise would not be required to be
provided pursuant to a subpoena or other civil discovery procedure; _provided_
, _however_ , that such access does not unreasonably interfere with the
business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and which books and
records (and the materials and information contained therein) the Seller
agrees to keep confidential. The Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any
of its Subsidiaries to, for a period of seven (7) years following the Closing
Date, destroy or otherwise dispose of any of the books and records of any of
the Company or its Subsidiaries (relating to the Business) for any period
prior to the Closing Date that are required to be retained for such period of
time under the current retention policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries
without first giving reasonable prior notice to the Seller and offering to
surrender to the Seller such books and records or any portion thereof
which the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries may intend to destroy or
dispose of.

6.02 _Notification_. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall promptly notify the Company if the Purchaser obtains knowledge
(a) of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which (i) results in any of its representations or warranties
contained in _Article IV_ being untrue or inaccurate in any material respect
(or, in the case of any representation or warranty qualified by its terms by
materiality,

 



38  including the word "material", then untrue or inaccurate in any respect) or
(ii) would be reasonably likely to cause any of the conditions set forth in
_Section 2.01_ and/or _Section 2.02_ to be incapable of satisfaction, and
(b) any breach of, or failure to comply in any material respect with, any
covenant of the Purchaser hereunder. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section
6.02_ or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event will the
Purchasers requirements set forth in this _Section 6.02_ be used by Seller
or the Company as a basis for a claim of breach by the Purchaser or a failure
to comply with a closing condition of Seller or the Company unless the
Purchaser acts in bad faith and willfully fails to comply in a material
respect with its obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.02_, which failure
has not been cured within ten (10) Business Days from receipt of a written
notice from Seller or the Company specifying in reasonable detail such
failure.

6.03  _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_. For a period of
six years after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall not, and shall not
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, repeal or modify any
provision in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries articles of
incorporation or bylaws relating to the exculpation or indemnification rights
of any current or former officer or director (the " _D andO Indemnified
Persons_") in a manner that would adversely affect such exculpation or
indemnification rights of any such current or former officer or director
(unless required by law), it being the intent of the parties that the DandO
Indemnified Persons shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and
indemnification rights to the fullest extent of the law to the extent provided
in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries articles of incorporation or
bylaws as of the date hereof relating to exculpation or indemnification. At
or prior to the Closing, the Company will obtain, maintain and fully pay for
irrevocable " _tail_ " insurance policies naming the DandO Indemnified Persons
as direct beneficiaries with a claims period of at least six years from the
Closing Date from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors
liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as
the Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Closing Date. The Purchaser will not, or will cause the
Company to not, cancel or change such insurance policies in any material
respect. If the Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Purchaser and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall assume
all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.03_. The provisions of
this _Section 6.03_ are intended for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each DandO Indemnified Person and his or her heirs and representatives, and
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have had by contract
or otherwise.

 

6.04 _Additional Insurance_. At or prior to the Closing, the Company will
obtain (at Purchasers sole cost and expense) irrevocable "runoff" insurance
policies in substance reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser naming the
Company as direct beneficiary as provided in _Schedule 6.04_.

 



39 6.05 _Conditions_. Subject to the terms of the covenants in _Section 8.05_
and  _Section 8.07_, Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the conditions set forth in _Section 2.02_ to be satisfied and to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein as soon as reasonably
possible after the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Article II_
(other than those to be satisfied at the Closing).

6.06  _Contact with Customers and Suppliers_. Prior to the Closing, the
Purchaser and the Purchasers Representatives shall contact and communicate
with the employees (other than the persons set forth on _Schedule 6.06_ ),
customers and suppliers of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby only after prior consultation with
and written approval of the Company.

 

6.07 _Employment and Benefit Arrangements_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to honor all employment, severance, termination, consulting,
retirement and other compensation and benefit plans, arrangements and
agreements to which the Company and/or its Subsidiaries is a party with
respect to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as such
plans, arrangements and agreements are in effect on the date hereof (it being
understood that this _Section 6.07_ shall not be deemed to prohibit the
Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from amending, modifying,
suspending, replacing or terminating such arrangements in accordance with
their terms). The Purchaser shall take all actions required so that eligible
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall receive service credit
with respect to service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (or their
predecessors) prior to the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility and
vesting under any employee benefit plans and arrangements (excluding any
defined benefit pension plans and equity or equity-related plans and
arrangements) in which each such employee is eligible to participate following
the Closing Date; provided that no retroactive contributions will be required
and provided, further, except to the extent such credit would result in the
duplication of benefits. To the extent that the Purchaser modifies any
coverage or benefit plans under which the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries participate, the Purchaser shall waive any applicable waiting
periods, pre-existing conditions or actively-at-work requirements and shall
give such employees credit under the new coverages or benefit plans for
deductibles, co-insurance and out-of-pocket payments that have been paid
during the year in which such coverage or plan modification occurs. This
_Section 6.07_ shall survive the Closing, and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Through December 31, 2015, Purchaser shall take all actions required so
that each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (determined as of the
Closing Date) (i) receives base compensation and bonus opportunities
(excluding any equity or equity-related opportunities) that are no less
favorable than that provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries to such
employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) receives benefits that,
in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to those benefits provided by
the Company or its Subsidiaries to such employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date and (iii) to the extent that any such employee is terminated for
other than "cause" following the Closing, receives severance pay that is no
less than the severance pay that would have been payable to such employee
under the severance policy in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



40 (b) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.07_ shall obligate Purchaser, the
Company, or any of the Companys Subsidiaries to continue the employment of
any employee of, or the service relationship of any other service provider to,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any period of time after the
Closing, and this  _Section 6.07_ shall not be construed to limit the
ability of Purchaser, the Company, or any of the Companys Subsidiaries to
terminate the employment of any employee of, or the service relationship of
any other service provider to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
following the Closing in accordance with applicable Law and any pre-existing
contractual relationship. Further, this _Section 6.07_ shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing
in this _Section 6.07_, express or implied, shall confer upon any other
Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this _Section 6.07_ or be construed as an amendment, waiver, termination, or
creation of any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, Contract,
policy, or arrangement of Purchaser, the Company, or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries.

 

6.08 _Blue Sky Filings_. The Purchaser, on or before the Closing Date, shall
take such action as is necessary in order to obtain an exemption for or to
qualify the Purchaser Shares for issuance to the Seller at the Closing
pursuant to this Agreement under applicable securities or "Blue Sky" laws, and
shall upon request provide evidence of any such action so taken to the Seller
on or prior to the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall make all filings and
reports relating to the offer and issue of the Purchaser Shares required under
applicable securities or "Blue Sky" laws following the Closing Date.

 

6.09 _Purchaser Interim Covenants_. The Purchaser hereby covenants and agrees
that, from the date hereof until the Closing, except as expressly provided in
this Agreement, as set forth on _Schedule 6.09_ or as consented to in writing
by the Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), the Purchaser shall not:

 

(a) amend or restate the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent
organizational documents) of the Purchaser in a manner that would have a
disproportionate adverse effect on the Seller as compared to other holders of
Purchaser Common Stock;

(b) split, combine or reclassify any Purchaser Common Stock, declare or pay
any dividend or other distribution with respect to Purchaser Common Stock, or
redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire or offer to redeem, repurchase, or
otherwise acquire any Purchaser Common Stock, except for repurchases of
shares of Purchaser Common Stock at then-prevailing market prices pursuant to
any Purchaser share repurchase program as in effect from time to time, unless,
in each case, equitable adjustments are made to the number of Purchaser
Shares constituting the Stock Consideration to the extent necessary to provide
to the Seller the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event; or

 

(c) enter into or adopt a plan or agreement of complete or partial
liquidation, dissolution, merger, consolidation,
restructuring, recapitalization or other material reorganization of the
Purchaser, unless, in each case, equitable adjustments are made to the number
of Purchaser Shares constituting the Stock Consideration to the extent
necessary to provide to the Seller the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such event.

to cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section 2.01_ not to be
satisfied;

(c) by the Seller (on behalf of itself and the Company), if there has been a
material violation or breach by the Purchaser of any covenant, representation

Date; _provided_ that Seller may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this  _Section 7.01(c)_ if Seller or the Company is then in breach of this
Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section 2.02_
not to be satisfied;

 

(d) by the Purchaser, if the transactions contemplated hereby have not been
consummated on or before March 2, 2015 (the " _Termination Date_ ");
_provided_ that the Purchaser shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.01(d)_ if the Purchasers breach of
this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Closing to occur prior to such Termination Date;

(e) by the Seller (on behalf of itself and the Company), if the transactions
contemplated hereby have not been consummated on or before the Termination
Date; _provided_ that the Seller shall not be entitled to terminate this

failure of the Closing to occur prior to such Termination Date;

 

(f) by the Purchaser or the Seller (on behalf of itself and the Company) if
there is in effect a final nonappealable Order, which prohibits the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, it being
agreed that the party so requesting termination shall have used commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly appeal any adverse determination that is 

 



42  not nonappealable and shall have diligently pursued such appeal; _provided_
that neither Seller nor Purchaser may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 7.01(f)_ if the issuance of such Order was caused by or
resulting from the material breach of such Persons obligations under this
Agreement; or

 

(g) by the Seller (on behalf of itself and the Company), (i) if Purchaser
shall have failed to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement no later than two (2) Business Days after the date on which the
Closing was required to have occurred pursuant and subject to the provisions
of _Section 1.03_ hereof and (ii) all of the conditions set forth in 
_Section 2.01_ would have been satisfied, or were capable of being satisfied,
if the Closing were to have occurred on such date, or such conditions were

such termination to the other parties hereto.

7.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event this Agreement is terminated by
either the Purchaser or the Seller as provided above, (a) the provisions of
this Agreement shall immediately become void and of no further force and
effect (other than this _Section 7.02_, _Section 7.03_ and  _Article X_
hereof which shall survive the termination of this Agreement); provided,
however, that the Confidentiality Agreement will survive the termination of
this Agreement for a period of two years following the date of
such termination (and, notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement
or the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, the Confidentiality
Agreement term will be automatically amended to be extended for such
additional two year period), and (b) there shall be no liability on the part
of any of the Purchaser, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Seller to
one another, except for (i) any Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to the
time of such termination or (ii) any failure by Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement if it is obligated to do so
pursuant to _Section 1.03_. Nothing in this _Article VII_ shall be deemed to
impair the right of any party to compel specific performance by another party
of its obligations under this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

 

7.03 _Remedies_.

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 7.02_, to the extent
applicable, in the event that Seller validly terminates this Agreement for any
reason, Seller will be entitled to seek any remedy available to it under this
Agreement, at law or in equity; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event
that (i) Seller validly terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.01(g)_ and (ii) the failure by Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is solely as a result of the
failure of the Debt Financing to be funded other than as a result of a Willful
Breach by Purchaser of this Agreement (a " _No Fault Debt Financing Failure_
"), then Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid (as Sellers and the
Companys sole and exclusive remedy hereunder (in addition to any amounts owed
pursuant to _Section 10.18_)) a termination fee of forty million dollars
($40,000,000) (the " _Termination Fee_ ") to Seller promptly, and in any
event within two (2) Business Days following such termination, by wire
transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by Seller. In
any other circumstance in which Seller validly terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.01(g)_, Seller may elect, in its sole discretion, to
deem such termination to be as a result of a No Fault Debt Financing Failure,
and in such event 

 



43  Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid the Termination Fee to Seller
promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days following such
election, by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts
designated by Seller. If Purchaser fails to pay the Termination Fee when due
(other than in any circumstance where Seller does not acknowledge at such time
that a No Fault Debt Financing Failure has occurred and the Termination Fee
is payable), interest will accrue on such amount from the date such payment
was required to be paid pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until the date
of payment at an annual rate of six percent (6%) (the " _Interest Amount_ ").
Each of Seller and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (1) the agreements
contained in this _Section 7.03_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby and (2) the right to payment of the Termination Fee (and
any amounts owed pursuant to _Section 10.18_) constitutes liquidated damages
(and not a penalty).

(b) In the event the Closing does not occur as a result of a No Fault Debt
Financing Failure (including a deemed No Fault Debt Financing Failure pursuant
to the second sentence of _Section 7.03(a)_), then the sole and exclusive
remedy of Seller and the Company against (i) Purchaser and its Subsidiaries,
(ii) the former, current or future holders of any direct or indirect equity,
partnership or limited liability company interest of Purchaser, (iii) any
lender, prospective lender, arranger or agent of or under the Debt Financing
or any of their respective former, current or future equityholders, (iv) any
holders or future holders of any capital stock or other equity interest
(including any options, warrants, calls, rights, convertible or exchangeable

fifteen (15) consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the trading
day that is two trading days prior to the date any payment is determined to be
finally due in connection with the final resolution of any such claim made
pursuant to this _Section 8.01(b)_. 

(c) The parties hereto agree that the provisions in this Agreement relating to
the limits imposed on the Purchasers remedies with respect to this Agreement

Company or its Subsidiaries relating to any Tax periods and shall abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and shall

or discarding any such books and records prior to the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations for that tax period, and if the Seller so

discarding such books and records.

the Seller copies of all filed Tax Returns relating to the tax periods (or
portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing.

deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and
instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or
other actions as such requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or
desirable to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(a) The Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to
be taken) all actions, and do (or cause to be done) all things, reasonably
necessary, to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions set forth
in the Debt Commitment Financing Letters, including using reasonable best
efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Financing Letters in
accordance with their terms and negotiate definitive agreements with respect
to the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Financing Letters (or on terms not materially less favorable to the
Purchaser than the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Financing Letters),
(ii) satisfy (or obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to the Purchaser set forth in the Debt Commitment Financing Letters
and the definitive agreements related thereto and comply in all material
respects with its obligations 

 



48  thereunder, and (iii) consummate the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Financing Letters at or prior to the Closing (and in any event
prior to the Termination Date). In the event that all conditions in the Debt
Commitment Financing Letters have been satisfied or, upon funding will be
satisfied, the Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
lenders and the other Persons providing the Debt Financing to fund on the
Closing Date the Debt Financing and otherwise enforce its rights under the
Debt Commitment Financing Letters, including, if appropriate, by promptly
commencing any litigation, enforcement action or other proceeding (including
any specific performance action or proceeding) against the lenders and the
other Persons providing the Debt Financing to compel each such lender and
other Person to provide its committed portion of the Debt Financing.
Notwithstanding any of the above, if and to the extent any portion of the
Debt Financing becomes unavailable for any reason so as not to enable the
Purchaser to proceed with the transactions contemplated by the Debt Financing
and this Agreement, the Purchaser will use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange alternative debt financing in an amount sufficient to replace such
unavailable Debt Financing (" _Alternative Debt Financing_ ," and any new
financing commitment or such other evidence of such Alternative
Debt Financing, the " _Alternative Debt Financing Commitment Letters_ ") on
(i) terms not materially less favorable in the aggregate and (ii) conditions
not less favorable, to the Purchaser than those set forth in the
Debt Commitment Financing Letters as in effect on the date hereof or the
definitive agreements related thereto. If any Alternative Debt Financing is
required in accordance with this _Section 8.07(a)_, the Purchaser shall
promptly provide the Company with a copy of any new Alternative Debt
Financing Commitment Letters or any definitive agreements related thereto (in
any case redacted for confidential terms) that provides such Alternative Debt
Financing. If applicable, any reference in this _Section 8.07_ or any other
provision of this Agreement to " _Debt Financing_ " will include the "
_Alternative Debt Financing_ " and any reference to " _Debt Commitment
Financing Letters_ " will include the " _Alternative Debt Financing
Commitment Letters_."

(b) The Purchaser shall not, without the prior written consent of the Seller,
permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of its material rights
under, or voluntarily replace (it being understood that any Alternative Debt
Financing shall not be deemed a voluntary replacement for purposes of the
sentence) any Debt Commitment Financing Letter; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Purchaser may amend, modify or waive the Debt Commitment Financing Letters
without the prior written consent of the Seller to the extent such
amendment, modification or waiver (w) does not add new (or adversely modify
any existing) conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing as compared
to those in the Debt Commitment Financing Letters and the related Fee Letters
as in effect on the date of this Agreement, (x) does not adversely affect the
ability of the Purchaser to enforce its rights against other parties to the
Debt Commitment Financing Letters or the definitive agreements related thereto
as so amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified, relative to the
ability of the Purchaser to enforce its rights against such other parties to
the Debt Commitment Financing Letters as in effect on the date hereof or in
the definitive agreements related thereto, (y) does not reduce the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing, or (z) would not, or would not reasonably be
expected to, prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement when required pursuant to
_Section 1.03_; _provided_ _further_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, no
prior written consent of the Seller shall be required for (A) any amendment,
replacement, supplement or modification of the Debt Commitment Financing
Letters that is

 



49  limited to adding lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents
or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Financing
Letters as of the date of this Agreement (including in replacement of a Debt
Financing Source) or (B) implementation or exercise of any "flex" provisions
provided in the Fee Letters related to the Debt Commitment Financing Letters
as in effect as of the date hereof. The Purchaser shall keep the Seller
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts
to consummate the Debt Financing. The Purchaser shall provide the Seller with
prompt oral and written notice of any breach or default by any party to any
Debt Commitment Financing Letters or the definitive agreements related thereto
of which the Purchaser gains knowledge and the receipt of any written notice
or other written communication from any lender, guarantor or other
financing source with respect to any breach or default or termination or
repudiation by any party to any Debt Commitment Financing Letters or the
definitive agreements related thereto or any provision thereof.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives, including legal and accounting Representatives, to provide,
in each case, at the Purchasers sole expense (in accordance with the
reimbursement provisions below), such cooperation as is reasonably requested
by the Purchaser and that is customarily provided in connection with
arranging and obtaining the Debt Financing, _provided_ that neither the Seller
nor any of its Subsidiaries (including the Company) shall be required to take
any actions in connection with such requested cooperation to the extent such
actions would unreasonably interfere with the ongoing businesses or operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Such cooperation shall include using
reasonable best efforts to:

 

(i) furnish the Purchaser and the Debt Financing Sources as promptly as
practicable with the financial statements referred to in _Section 2.01(j)_
and _Section 2.01(k)_ (the " _Required Information_ ");

(ii) participate on reasonable advance notice in a reasonable number of

and sessions with prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies in
connection with the Debt Financing;

(iii) assist with the preparation of materials for rating agencies and rating
agency presentations, bank information memoranda and similar documents
required in connection with the Debt Financing (and provide reasonable and
customary authorization letters to the Debt Financing Sources authorizing the
distribution of information regarding the Company to prospective lenders);

(iv) cooperate with the Purchaser to satisfy the conditions precedent to the
Debt Financing to the extent within the control of the Seller and its
Subsidiaries (including the Company); and

 



50 (v) provide reasonable assistance to the Purchaser in obtaining any
corporate credit and family ratings from any ratings agencies as contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Financing Letters;

_provided_ that (w) Persons who are directors or officers of the Company and
its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date in their capacity as such shall not
be required to adopt resolutions or execute consents to approve or authorize
the execution of the Debt Financing, (x) no action, liability or obligation
of the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Company) or any of
their respective Representatives under any certificate, agreement,
arrangement, document or instrument relating to the Debt Financing shall be
effective until the Closing Date or immediately prior thereto (except for
customary authorization letters authorizing the distribution of information to
prospective lenders), (y) neither the Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Company), nor any of their respective Representatives, shall be
required to provide any legal opinion or other opinion of counsel in
connection with the Debt Financing, and (z) any bank information memoranda
required in relation to the Debt Financing shall contain disclosure and
financial statements reflecting the Purchaser and/or its Subsidiaries as the
obligor; and _provided_ , _further_ , that neither the Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Company) shall be required to pay any commitment
fee or other fee or payment to obtain consent or to incur any liability with
respect to or cause or permit any Lien to be placed on any of their respective
assets in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Closing Date.

(d) The Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly provide
the Purchaser with an electronic version of the trademarks, service marks and
corporate logo of the Company and its Subsidiaries for use in marketing
materials for the purpose of facilitating the syndication of the Debt
Financing, and hereby consents to the reasonable use of the foregoing in
connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ that such logos are used in a
manner that is not intended to harm or disparage the Seller or its
Subsidiaries (including the Company) or their marks and on such
other customary terms and conditions as the Seller shall reasonably impose.
All material non-public information provided by the Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Company) or any of their Representatives pursuant
to this  _Section 8.07_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that the Purchaser shall be permitted to
disclose such information to the Debt Financing Sources, rating agencies and
prospective lenders and investors in connection with the Debt Financing
subject to the ratings agencies and prospective lenders and investors entering
into customary confidentiality undertakings with respect to such information
(including through a notice and undertaking in a form customarily used in
confidential information memoranda for senior credit facilities).

(e) Nothing in this  _Section 8.07_ shall require such cooperation to the
extent it would (i) cause any condition to Closing set forth in _Article II_
to fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement or
(ii) require the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Company) to
take any action that will (A) conflict with or violate the Sellers or any of
its Subsidiaries (including the Companys) organizational documents or any
laws or (B) result in the contravention of, or would reasonably be expected
to result in a material violation of, or material default under, any Contract
to which the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Company) is a
party on the date hereof.

 



51 (f) The Purchaser shall promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Seller and/or the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by
the Seller, the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives in connection with such cooperation, including all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs paid to a non-employee Third Party related to the
preparation of the financial statements required to be delivered pursuant to
_Section 2.01(j)_ and _Section 2.01(k)_, and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all Damages actually suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the syndication, obtaining or arrangement
of the Debt Financing, any action taken by them at the request of the
Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 8.07_ and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than information provided by the Company or its
Subsidiaries).

 

(g) If the Company at any time in good faith reasonably believes that it has
delivered the Required Information to the Purchaser, it may deliver to
Purchaser a written notice to such effect, in which case the Company shall be
deemed to have delivered the Required Information at the time of delivery of
such notice, unless the Purchaser shall provide to the Company within
four (4) Business Days after the delivery of such notice a written notice
that describes with reasonable specificity the information that constitutes
Required Information that the Purchaser in good faith reasonably believes the
Company has not delivered.

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.07 or elsewhere in this
Agreement to the contrary, in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the
Closing Date, in no event will the Seller, the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries be required to pay any commitment fee or other fee, incur any
out-of-pocket costs not subject to reimbursement pursuant to _Section
8.07(f)_ (except as provided therein), provide any security or incur any
liability.

10.10 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed
to give any Person other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or
equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or

present and future directors, officers, employees, incorporators, members,
partners,

 



65  stockholders, Affiliates, agents, attorneys, advisors and representatives of

Financing Sources are intended Third Party beneficiaries of, and shall be
entitled to rely upon and enforce, _Sections 7.03(b)_ , _10.08_ , _10.10_ ,
_10.11_ , _10.13_ , _10.16_ , _10.17_ , and _10.21_.

10.11 _Waiver of Trial by Jury_. THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVE ANY RIGHT, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, CLAIM OR
PROCEEDING (I) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (II) ARISING OUT OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, REGARDLESS OF WHICH PARTY INITIATES SUCH
ACTION OR PROCEEDING. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, EACH OF THE PARTIES
HERETO AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT BRING OR SUPPORT ANY ACTION, CAUSE OF ACTION,
CLAIM, CROSS-CLAIM OR THIRD-PARTY CLAIM OF ANY KIND OR DESIGNATION, WHETHER
IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, AGAINST ANY
OF THE DEBT FINANCING SOURCES IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY
DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE DEBT COMMITMENT
FINANCING LETTERS, OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF, IN ANY FORUM OTHER THAN THE
SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, CITY OF NEW YORK, OR IF UNDER
APPLICABLE LAW EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IS VESTED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS, THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK (AND
APPELLATE COURTS THEREOF).

 

10.12 _Purchaser Deliveries_. The Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that all
documents or other items delivered or made available to the Purchaser,
Purchasers legal counsel or to the Purchasers financial advisor, Morgan
Stanley and Co. LLC, shall be deemed to be delivered or made available, as the
case may be, to the Purchaser for all purposes hereunder.

 

10.13 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the rights of each party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and recognize and
affirm that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any party, money
damages would be inadequate and the non-breaching party would have no adequate
remedy at law. Accordingly, the parties agree that, unless this Agreement
has been terminated in accordance with _Article VII_ , such non-breaching
party shall, subject to the following sentence, have the right, in addition to
any other rights and remedies existing in their favor at law or in equity, to
enforce their rights and the other partys obligations hereunder not only by
an action or actions for damages but also by an action or actions for specific
performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without posting of bond
or other security). Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, it is explicitly agreed that the Seller and the
Company shall not be entitled to seek specific performance of Purchasers
obligation to cause the Closing to occur or the payments to be made pursuant
to _Article I_ , unless: (i) all conditions in _Section 2.01_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing and
that would be capable of being satisfied if there were a Closing) have been
satisfied, (ii) the Debt Financing provided for by the Debt Commitment
Financing Letters has been funded or will be funded at the Closing,

 



66  (iii) the Seller and the Company have each irrevocably confirmed in a
written notice to Purchaser that if specific performance is granted pursuant
to this _Section 10.13(a)_, the Seller and the Company are each ready,
willing and able to consummate the Closing and (iv) Purchaser is required to
consummate the Closing pursuant to _Section 1.03_ and Purchaser has not done
so.

 

(b) Until such time as Purchaser pays and the Seller accepts the Termination
Fee (and any Interest Amounts and/or any amounts owed pursuant to _Section
10.18_) (or Seller otherwise refuses to accept payment of the Termination Fee
in circumstances in which it is payable pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement), the equitable remedies available to the Seller (on behalf of
itself and the Company) described in this _Section 10.13_ shall be in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies at law or in equity that
they may elect to pursue.

 

10.14 _Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement and any signed agreement entered
into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any amendments hereto
or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine
or electronic mail, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the
request of any party hereto or to any such contract, each other party hereto
or thereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other parties. No party hereto or to any such contract shall raise the use of
a facsimile machine or electronic mail to deliver a signature or the fact that
any signature or contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of
facsimile machine or in electronic or digital form as a defense to the
formation of a contract and each such party forever waives any such defense.

10.15  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signature of more than one
party, but all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.

 

10.16 _Governing Law_. All Claims, issues and questions concerning the
construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement
and the exhibits and schedules hereto (whether in contract or tort) that may
be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of
action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or
warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement) or the transactions
contemplated hereby, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements executed and
performed entirely within such State, without giving effect to any choice of
law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware
or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of
any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware; _provided,_ _however,_ that
any Claim, cause or action, dispute, suit or other proceeding relating in any
way to any Debt Financing Source or the Debt Financing, whether or not any
Debt Financing Source is a party thereto, shall be governed by the laws of the
State of New York. Each of the parties hereto agrees (a) that this Agreement
involves at least one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) and (b) that this
Agreement has been entered into by the parties hereto in express reliance upon
6 Del. C. §2708\.

10.17 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF _SECTION 1.05_
(WHICH SHALL GOVERN ANY DISPUTE ARISING THEREUNDER), THE PARTIES

 



67  AGREE THAT JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN ANY SUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT
BY ANY PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, OR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED HEREUNDER SHALL
PROPERLY AND EXCLUSIVELY LIE IN ANY FEDERAL OR STATE COURT LOCATED IN
DELAWARE. EACH PARTY ALSO AGREES NOT TO BRING ANY SUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR
THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED HEREUNDER IN ANY OTHER COURT. BY
EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO
THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY WITH
RESPECT TO ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY
AGREE THAT VENUE WOULD BE PROPER IN SUCH COURT, AND HEREBY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION
THAT ANY SUCH COURT IS AN IMPROPER OR INCONVENIENT FORUM FOR THE RESOLUTION OF
SUCH SUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING. THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THE MAILING
BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, OF ANY PROCESS
REQUIRED BY ANY SUCH COURT SHALL CONSTITUTE VALID AND LAWFUL SERVICE OF
PROCESS AGAINST THEM, WITHOUT NECESSITY FOR SERVICE BY ANY OTHER MEANS
PROVIDED BY STATUTE OR RULE OF COURT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, EACH OF
THE PARTIES HERETO AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT BRING OR SUPPORT ANY ACTION, CAUSE
OF ACTION, CLAIM, CROSS-CLAIM OR THIRD PARTY CLAIM OF ANY KIND
OR DESIGNATION, WHETHER IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT
OR OTHERWISE, AGAINST ANY OF THE DEBT FINANCING SOURCES IN ANY WAY RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT,
INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE DEBT
COMMITMENT FINANCING LETTERS, OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF, IN ANY FORUM OTHER
THAN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, CITY OF NEW YORK, OR IF UNDER
APPLICABLE LAW EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IS VESTED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS, THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK (AND
APPELLATE COURTS THEREOF).

 

10.18 _Prevailing Party_. If there shall occur any dispute or proceeding
between the parties relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, the non-prevailing party shall pay all reasonable costs
and fees (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) of the prevailing
party.

 

10.19 _Acknowledgement_. In any dispute or proceeding arising under or in
connection with this Agreement following the Closing, the Seller shall have
the right, at its election, to retain Kirkland and Ellis LLP to represent it in
such matter, and the Purchaser hereby irrevocably waives and consents to any
such representation in any such matter and the communication by such counsel
to the Seller in connection with any such representation of any fact known to
such counsel arising by reason of such counsels prior representation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. The Purchaser irrevocably acknowledges
and agrees that all communications between the Company and its Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and counsel, on the

 



68  other hand, made in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution,
delivery and Closing under, or any dispute or proceeding arising under or in
connection with this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that, immediately prior to the
Closing, would be deemed to be privileged communications of any of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and its counsel, on the other hand,
and would not be subject to disclosure to the Purchaser in connection with any
process relating to a dispute arising under or in connection with, this
Agreement or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, shall continue after the Closing and for all purposes be
deemed to be privileged communications between the Seller, on the one hand,
and its counsel, on the other hand, and neither the Purchaser nor any Person
purporting to act on behalf of or through Purchaser shall seek to obtain the
same by any process on the grounds that the privilege attaching to such
communications, belongs to the Company and its Subsidiaries, and not to the
Seller.

 

10.20 _Payments under this Agreement_. Each party agrees that all amounts
required to be paid hereunder shall be paid in United States currency and,
except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, without discount,
rebate, reduction or withholding and not subject counterclaim or offset, on
the dates required hereby (with time being of the essence).

 

10.21 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
Claim based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought against, the Persons that
are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such party. Except to
the extent a named party to this Agreement (and then only to the extent of
the specific obligations undertaken by such named party in this Agreement and
not otherwise), no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney,
advisor or Representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing, and no Debt
Financing Source, shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity
or otherwise) for any one or more of the representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements or other obligations or liabilities of any one or more
of the Company, Seller or Purchaser under this Agreement of or for any Claim
based on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Seller acknowledges that it has no right of recovery (for Damages or any other
remedy of the Seller and its Affiliates, as the case may be) against (and
hereby waives all such rights), and no personal liability shall attach to,
any Debt Financing Source with respect to this Agreement, whether directly or
by or through a Claim by or on behalf of the Purchaser against any Debt
Financing Source, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable law,
or otherwise. Recourse against the Purchaser to the extent permitted in this
Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller and its
Affiliates against the Debt Financing Sources in respect of any liabilities
arising under, or in connection with, this Agreement, the Debt Financing and
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this _Section 10.21_ or elsewhere in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this _Section 10.21_ shall limit or otherwise impair any
of the Companys or the Sellers rights under  _Section 10.13_ solely as to
each other.

 



69 10.22 _Release_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, effective as
of the Closing Date, the Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), hereby irrevocably waives any
and all Claims and right to recourse against the Company or any of its
officers, managers or employees with respect to any misrepresentation or
breach of any representation, warranty or indemnity, or noncompliance with any
conditions, covenants or agreements, given or made about or with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in this Agreement and any agreement
and/or certificate delivered pursuant hereto. Neither the Seller nor any of
its Affiliates shall be entitled, directly or indirectly, to contribution
from, subrogation to or recovery against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates from and after the
Closing) with respect to any liability of the Seller or any of its Affiliates
that may arise under or pursuant to this Agreement or any agreement and/or
certificate delivered pursuant hereto; _provided_ that, officers, directors,
managers and employees of Seller and/or its Affiliates shall continue to be
entitled to insurance arising under _Section 6.03_ or indemnification under
any of the organization documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
in each case, as applicable. In consideration of this Agreement, the Seller,
on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates (other than the Company and
its Subsidiaries), executors, heirs, legal representatives, successors
(whether pursuant to testamentary disposition, the Laws of descent and
distribution or otherwise) and permitted assigns (any of the foregoing, a "
_Seller Releasing Party_ ") hereby releases and forever discharges, effective
as of the Closing Date, the Company and the Purchaser, each of their
respective Subsidiaries, and each of their respective officers, managers,
directors, employees and Representatives (each, a " _Seller Released Party_
") from any and all Claims, liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, absolute or contingent, liquidated
or unliquidated, due or to become due, accrued, fixed or otherwise) which
have been or could have been or could be asserted against any Seller Released
Party, which such Seller Releasing Party has or ever had or may have, arising
out of or in any way relating to events, circumstances, actions or omissions,
occurring, existing or taken prior to or as of the Closing Date with respect
to matters relating to the Company; provided, however, that the parties
acknowledge and agree that this _Section 10.22_ does not apply to and shall
not constitute a release of (a) any rights or obligations arising under this
Agreement, including full and complete payment for its Shares in accordance
with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement or any other rights or
obligations arising under this Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement or any other agreements contemplated hereby, (b) any
rights or obligations arising under or related to the ownership of the
Purchaser Shares, (c) if such Seller Affiliate is an employee or consultant
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, rights under any Benefit Plan
(other than as it relates to the provision of equity or equity-based
compensation or other forms of incentive or deferred compensation) or rights
to earned but unpaid wages or compensation, unpaid vacation and unreimbursed
business expenses and (d) rights to directors and officers insurance arising
under _Section 6.03_ or indemnification under any of the organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

and individually as a " _Party_." Capitalized terms used herein but not
defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Purchase Agreement
(as defined below).

WHEREAS, Seller, Purchaser, and other parties thereto are parties to that
certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 10, 2014 (the "
_Purchase Agreement_ ");

WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement and as part of the
transactions contemplated thereby, Seller and Purchaser agreed to enter into
this Agreement and deposit the Escrow Amount (as defined below) with the
Escrow Agent for the purposes set forth herein;

WHEREAS, Section 1.04(vi) of the Purchase Agreement provides that, at the
Closing, Purchaser shall deliver the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent to be
held in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the Parties and the Escrow Agent desire to more specifically set
forth their rights and obligations with respect to the Escrow Amount and the
distribution and release thereof;

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants set forth herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Parties and the Escrow Agent hereby agree as
follows.

1\. _Appointment of Escrow Agent_. Seller and Purchaser hereby appoint the

the " _Escrow Funds_ "). The Escrow Agent shall establish and maintain the
escrow account in which the Escrow Funds will be held (the " _Escrow Account_
"). The Escrow Agent shall not distribute or release the Escrow Funds except
in accordance with the express terms and conditions of this Agreement.

3\. _Permitted Investments_.

 

(a) The Escrow Agent shall follow the Joint Instructions (as defined below) of
the Parties concerning any investment or reinvestment from time to time of
the funds held in the Escrow Account; _provided_ _that_ permissible

to the extent reasonably practicable, in MandT Bank Corporate Deposit Account
(the " _CDA_ ") or such successor or similar fund with the Escrow Agent.
Amounts on deposit in the CDA are insured up to a total of $250,000 per
depositor, per insured bank (including principal and accrued interest) by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ "), subject to the
applicable rules and regulations of the FDIC. The Parties understand that
deposits in the CDA are not secured. Neither of the Parties nor the Escrow
Agent shall be liable or responsible in any manner for any loss or
depreciation resulting from any such Permitted Investment or any liquidation
thereof, or for any costs in connection therewith, and all of said losses and
costs shall be borne by the Escrow Account. The Escrow Agent is hereby
authorized to execute purchases and sales of investments through the
facilities of its own trading or capital markets operations or those of
any affiliated entity. The Escrow Agent shall send statements to each of the
Parties on a monthly basis reflecting activity in the Escrow Account for the
preceding month. The Escrow Agent will act upon investment instructions the
day that such instructions are received; _provided_ _that_ the instructions
are communicated within a reasonable amount of time to allow the Escrow Agent
to make the specified investment. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Joint Instructions_ " shall mean a written direction executed by both (i) a
Person whose signature appears on _Exhibit A-1_ hereto and (ii) a Person whose
signature appears on _Exhibit A-2_ hereto, directing the Escrow Agent
to disburse all or a portion of the Escrow Funds or to take or refrain from
taking any other action pursuant to this Escrow Agreement.

(b) The Parties recognize and agree that the Escrow Agent will not provide
supervision, recommendations or advice relating to either the investment of
moneys held in the Escrow Account or the purchase, sale, retention or other
disposition of any Permitted Investment.

(c) Although the Parties recognize that they may obtain a broker confirmation
or written statement containing comparable information at no additional cost,
the Parties hereby agree that confirmations of Permitted Investments are not
required to be issued by the Escrow Agent for each month in which a monthly
statement is rendered.

 

(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the delivery of the escrowed
property is subject to the sale and final settlement of
Permitted Investments. Proceeds of a sale of Permitted Investments will be
delivered on the Business Day on which the appropriate instructions are
delivered to the Escrow Agent if received prior to the deadline for same day
sale of such Permitted Investments. If such instructions are received after
the applicable deadline, proceeds will be delivered on the next succeeding
Business Day.

4.  _Release of Escrow Funds_. The Escrow Funds shall be distributed and
released only as follows.

(a) _Post-Closing Adjustment_. Pursuant to Section 1.05(c)(i) of the Purchase
Agreement, if the Final Cash Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Cash
Purchase Price (as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.05(b) of the
Purchase Agreement), Seller and Purchaser will deliver to the Escrow Agent
Joint Instructions directing the Escrow Agent to make payment, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to, or as directed by, Seller, all
remaining funds in the Escrow Account.

 

(b) Pursuant to Section 1.05(c)(ii) of the Purchase Agreement, if the Final
Cash Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Cash Purchase Price (as
finally determined pursuant to Section 1.05(b) of the Purchase Agreement),
Seller and Purchaser will deliver to the Escrow Agent Joint Instructions
directing the Escrow Agent to make payment, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to, or as directed by, (x) Purchaser, the amount of any such
shortfall and (y) Seller, any amount remaining in the Escrow Account after the
payment of such shortfall.

 



2 5\. _Conditions to Escrow_. The Escrow Agent agrees to hold the Escrow Funds
and to perform its obligations in accordance with the terms and provisions of
this Agreement. The Parties agree that the Escrow Agent shall not assume any
responsibility for the failure of the Parties to perform in accordance with
the Purchase Agreement or this Agreement. The acceptance by the Escrow Agent
of its responsibilities hereunder is subject to the following terms and
conditions, which the parties hereto agree shall govern and control with
respect to the Escrow Agents rights, duties and liabilities hereunder.

(a) _Documents_. The Escrow Agent shall be protected in acting upon any
written notice, request, waiver, consent, receipt or other paper or document
furnished to it, not only as to its due execution and validity and the
effectiveness of its provisions, but also as to the truth and accuracy of any
information therein contained, which the Escrow Agent in good faith believes
to be genuine and what it purports to be. Should it be necessary for the
Escrow Agent to act upon any instructions, directions, documents or
instruments issued or signed by or on behalf of any corporation, partnership,
fiduciary or individual acting on behalf of another party hereto, it shall
not be necessary for the Escrow Agent to inquire into such corporations,
partnerships, fiduciarys or individuals authority. The Escrow Agent is also
relieved from the necessity of satisfying itself as to the authority of the
persons executing this Agreement in a representative capacity on behalf of any
of the Parties. Concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser and
Seller shall deliver to the Escrow Agent authorized signers forms in the
form of _Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_ to this Agreement.

(b)  _Liability_. Provided the Escrow Agent complies with Joint Instructions
furnished to it by Purchaser and Seller, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable
for anything which it may do or refrain from doing in connection herewith,
except for its own gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud.

(c) _Legal Counsel_. The Escrow Agent may consult with, and obtain advice
from, outside legal counsel in the event of any question as to any of the
provisions hereof or its duties hereunder, and it shall incur no liability and
shall be fully protected in acting in good faith in accordance with the
opinion and instructions of such counsel.

(d) _Limitation of Duties_. The Escrow Agent shall have no duties except those
which are expressly set forth herein and it shall not be bound by any
agreements of the other parties hereto, including, without limitation, the
Purchase Agreement (whether or not it has any knowledge thereof). The Escrow
Agent shall not be deemed a fiduciary for any party to this Agreement.
PROVIDED THE ESCROW AGENT COMPLIES WITH JOINT INSTRUCTIONS FURNISHED TO IT BY
PURCHASER AND SELLER OR A FINAL ORDER, THE ESCROW AGENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE,
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY (I) DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES ARISING OUT
OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER, OTHER THAN DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES
WHICH HAVE BEEN FINALLY ADJUDICATED TO HAVE DIRECTLY RESULTED FROM THE ESCROW
AGENTS FRAUD, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, OR (II) SPECIAL,
INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF THE ESCROW AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF
ACTION.

 

(e) _Resignation or Termination of Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent shall have
the right to resign at any time by giving thirty (30) calendar days prior
written notice of such resignation to the Parties and the Parties shall have
the right to terminate the services of the Escrow Agent hereunder at any time
by giving joint written notice (with such written notice being signed by the
Parties) of such

 



3  termination to the Escrow Agent, in each case specifying the effective date
of such resignation or termination. Within thirty (30) days after receiving or
delivering the aforesaid notice, as the case may be, the Parties agree to
appoint a successor escrow agent to which the Escrow Agent shall distribute
the property then held hereunder in accordance with the terms hereof. If a
successor escrow agent has not been appointed and has not accepted such
appointment by the end of such thirty (30)-day period, the Escrow Agent may
apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor
escrow agent, and the reasonable costs and expenses which are incurred
in connection with any such proceeding shall be paid one-half by Seller and
one-half by Purchaser. Except as otherwise agreed to in writing by the
Parties, in the event of the Escrow Agents resignation or termination, no
Escrow Funds shall be released from the Escrow Account unless and until a
successor escrow agent has been appointed in accordance with this _Section
5(e)_.

 

(f) _Discharge of Escrow Agent_. Upon delivery of all of the Escrow Funds
pursuant to the terms of _Section 4_ above or to a successor escrow agent,
the Escrow Agent shall thereafter be discharged from any further obligations
hereunder. The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in any and all events, to
comply with and obey any and all fixed, nonappealable judgments, orders and
decrees of any court of competent jurisdiction which may be filed, entered or
issued (each a " _Final Order_ "), and, if it shall so comply or obey, it
shall not be liable to any other person by reason of such compliance
or obedience. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to receive and may
conclusively rely upon an opinion of counsel to the effect that a judgment,
order or decree is final, nonappealable and from a court of competent
jurisdiction.

 

(g) _Interpleading of Assets upon Dispute_. In the event that (i) any dispute
shall arise between the Parties with respect to the disposition or
disbursement of any of the assets held hereunder or (ii) the Escrow Agent
shall be uncertain as to how to proceed in a situation not explicitly
addressed by the terms of this Agreement whether because of conflicting
demands by the other parties hereto or otherwise, the Escrow Agent shall be
permitted to interplead all of the assets held hereunder into a court of
competent jurisdiction, and thereafter be fully relieved from any and all
liability or obligation with respect to such interpleaded assets or may, at
its option, retain the assets until the Escrow Agent receives Joint
Instructions. The Parties further agree to pursue any redress or recourse in
connection with such a dispute, without making the Escrow Agent a party to
the same.

(h) _Agency_. The Escrow Agent shall have the right to perform any of its
duties hereunder through agents, attorneys, custodians or nominees.

(i) _Merger of Escrow Agent_. Any banking association or corporation into
which the Escrow Agent may be merged, converted or with which the Escrow
Agent may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Escrow Agent shall be a party, or any
banking association or corporation to which all or substantially all of the
corporate trust business of the Escrow Agent shall be transferred, shall
succeed to all the Escrow Agents rights, obligations and immunities hereunder
without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part
of any of the Parties, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.

(j) _Garnishment of Escrow Funds_. In the event that any of the Escrow Funds
shall be attached, garnished or levied upon by any court order, or the
delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an order of a court, or any
order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court
order affecting the property deposited under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent
is hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply
with all writs, orders or decrees so entered or issued, which it is advised by
legal counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without
jurisdiction, and in the event that the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with
any such writ, order or decree it shall not be liable to any of the parties
hereto or to any other person, firm or corporation, by reason of such
compliance notwithstanding such writ, order or decree being subsequently
reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

 



4 6\. _Taxation_. Seller hereby acknowledges that, for federal and state income
Tax purposes, any interest, dividends, gains and other income earned on the
Escrow Funds (the " _Escrow Earnings_ ") shall be income of Seller. The Escrow
Agent shall be responsible for reporting any Escrow Earnings to the Internal
Revenue Service;  _provided_ _that_ the Parties acknowledge that payments of
any Escrow Earnings will be subject to backup withholding penalties unless a
properly completed Internal Revenue Service form W-8 or W-9 certification is
submitted to the Escrow Agent on behalf of Seller. Seller hereby acknowledges
that, unless otherwise required by applicable law and subject to the
immediately preceding sentence, the Escrow Agent is not required to prepare
and file any income or other Tax Returns applicable to the Escrow Account with
the IRS or any required state or local departments of revenue in any year
income is earned in any particular Tax year. Any Taxes payable on the Escrow
Earnings shall be paid by Seller, whether or not the income was distributed by
the Escrow Agent during any particular year and to the extent required under
the provisions of the Code.

 

7\. _Indemnification_. Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other
hand, hereby agree, severally and not jointly, to indemnify the Escrow Agent
for and to hold it harmless against any loss, liability or reasonable expense
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred without gross
negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on the part of the Escrow
Agent arising out of or in connection with its performance under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, Seller, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other hand, shall each be responsible for not more than 50%
of any such losses, liabilities, fees or expenses.

8\. _Escrow Costs_. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to be paid a fee for
its services pursuant to the attached _Exhibit B_ and to be reimbursed for
its reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with maintaining the
Escrow Account hereunder, which fees, costs and expenses shall be paid one-
half by Seller and one-half by Purchaser. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled
and is hereby granted the right to set off and deduct from the Escrow Funds
any unpaid fees, non-reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied indemnification
rights from such Escrow Funds. In the event that the Escrow Agent exercises
its right to set off set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, the
amount of such set off for which (i) Seller is responsible shall be repaid by
Seller to Purchaser and (ii) Purchaser is responsible shall be replenished by
Purchaser into the Escrow Funds.

9\. _Limitations on Rights to Escrow Funds_. None of the Parties shall have
any right, title or interest in or to, or possession of, the Escrow Account
and therefore shall not have the ability to pledge, convey, hypothecate or
grant as security all or any portion of the Escrow Funds unless and until
such Escrow Funds have been released pursuant to _Section 4_ above.
Accordingly, the Escrow Agent shall be in sole possession of the Escrow Funds
and shall not act as custodian of the Parties under this Agreement for
the purposes of perfecting a security interest therein, and no creditor of
any of the Parties shall have any right to have or to hold or otherwise attach
or seize all or any portion of the Escrow Funds as collateral for any
obligation and shall not be able to obtain a security interest in any of the
Escrow Funds unless and until such Escrow Funds have been released pursuant to
_Section 4_ above.

 

10\. _Notices_. All notices, demands and other communications to be given or
delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been given (i) when personally delivered,
sent by fax or email (with hard copy to follow) or sent by reputable overnight
express courier (charges prepaid), or (ii) three business days following
mailing by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid and return receipt
requested. Unless another address is specified in writing, notices, demands
and communications to Seller, Purchaser, and the Escrow Agent shall be sent
to the addresses indicated below.

11\. _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement, together with the
Purchase Agreement, contains the entire understanding of the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior
understandings or agreements by or among the parties hereto, whether written
or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way. This
Agreement may be amended, or any provision of this Agreement may be waived,
so long as such amendment or waiver is set forth in a writing executed by each
of the Parties (a copy of which shall be promptly provided to the Escrow
Agent); _provided_   _that_ , if any such amendment or waiver would have the
effect of increasing or expanding the Escrow Agents obligations or duties
under this Agreement, the written consent of the Escrow Agent shall be
required in addition to the written consent of the Parties. No course of
dealing between or among the parties hereto shall be deemed effective to
modify, amend or discharge any part of this Agreement of any rights or
obligations of any party hereto under or by reason of this Agreement.

12\. _Assigns and Assignment_. This Agreement and all actions taken hereunder
shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon all of the parties
hereto and upon all of their respective successors and assigns; _provided_

hereunder except as provided in  _Sections 5(e)_ and _5(i)_ above and (b) no

unless and until written notice of such assignment is delivered to and
acknowledged by the Escrow Agent.

 

13\. _No Other Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing herein expressed or implied
is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or to give any Person other
than the Escrow Agent, the Parties and their permitted assigns any rights or
remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

14\. _Interpretation_. The headings in this Agreement are inserted for
convenience of reference only and shall not be a part of or control or affect
the meaning hereof.

15\. _No Waiver_. No failure or delay by a party hereto in exercising any
right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no
single or partial exercise thereof shall preclude any right of further
exercise or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The right of
the Parties to receive all or a portion of the Escrow Funds under the
circumstances described in _Section 4_ above is in addition to, and not in
lieu of, any other remedies that any Person may have against another Person
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement in the event of a breach of, or other
liability under, the Purchase Agreement.

16\. _Severability_. The parties hereto agree that (a) the provisions of this
Agreement shall be severable in the event that for any reason whatsoever the
provisions hereof are invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, (b) such
invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable provisions shall be
automatically replaced by other provisions that are as similar as possible in
terms to such invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable provisions but are
valid and enforceable and (c) the remaining provisions shall remain
enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

 



7 17\. _No Strict Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their

provision contained herein. Each defined term used in this Agreement has a

18\. _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the construction,
validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the domestic laws of the State of

the State of Delaware. Jurisdiction as between Seller and Purchaser shall be
governed by Section 10.17 of the Purchase Agreement.

 

19\. _Banking Days_. If any date on which the Escrow Agent is required to make

the next succeeding banking day.

20.  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto
individually or in any combination, in one or more counterparts (including by
means of telecopied or PDF signature pages), each of which shall be an
original and all of which shall together constitute one and the same
agreement.

21\. _Conflicts_. The Parties agree and acknowledge that to the extent

or in conflict with any term, condition or provision of the Purchase
Agreement, the Purchase Agreement shall govern and control. Unless and until

conflict exists between this Agreement and this Purchase Agreement, it shall
be entitled to conclusively assume that no such inconsistency or conflict

meaning of 11 U.S.C. § 541\.

23.  _Specific Performance_. The obligations of the parties hereto (including
the Escrow Agent) are unique in that time is of the essence, and any delay in
performance hereunder by any party will result in irreparable harm to the
other parties hereto. Accordingly, any party may seek specific performance
and/or injunctive relief before any court of competent jurisdiction in order
to enforce this Agreement or to prevent violations of the provisions hereof,
and no party will object to specific performance or injunctive relief as an
appropriate remedy. The Escrow Agent acknowledges that its obligations, as
well as the obligations of any party hereunder, are subject to the equitable
remedy of specific performance and/or injunctive relief.

24\. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate when all of the Escrow

with _Section 4_. Upon such termination this Agreement shall have no further
force and effect, except that the provisions of this _Section 24_ and

Securities (and the Holder shall cease to have any registration rights with
respect thereto under this Agreement) at the Registration Rights Termination
Time or, if earlier than the Registration Rights Termination Time, on the date

before the Registration Rights Termination Time, the Holder shall not cease to
have registration rights with respect to the Registrable Securities covered by
such Demand Registration Notice or Piggyback Registration Notice solely by
reason of the subsequent occurrence of the Registration Rights Termination
Time.

2.2 _Demand Registration_.

 

(a) At any time during the period beginning on the Demand Rights Commencement
Date and ending at the Registration Rights Termination Time, the Holder may
deliver a written request to the Company (the " _Demand Registration Notice_
") to file a Registration Statement (the " _Demand Registration Statement_ ")
for the registration of Registrable Securities to be offered and sold
pursuant to an Underwritten Offering (the " _Demand Registration_ "). The
Demand Registration Notice shall specify the aggregate number of Registrable
Securities requested to the registered pursuant to the Demand Registration.
Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2.6(a), the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to file as soon as reasonably practicable with
the SEC (and, unless otherwise agreed to by the Holder, on or before
20 Business Days after its receipt of the Demand Registration Notice or, if
financial statements required to be included in such a filing are not
reasonably available on or before the expiration of such period of 20 Business
Days, as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter), and cause to become or
be declared effective under the Securities Act as soon as reasonably
practicable, a Demand Registration Statement as will permit the sale and
distribution of all or such portion of the Holders Registrable Securities as
are specified in the Demand Registration Notice. The Company shall promptly
notify the Holder of the date on which the Demand Registration Statement
becomes or is declared effective.

 

(b) The Holder shall have the right to cause the Company to effect one Demand
Registration pursuant to Section 2.2(a). A Demand Registration requested
pursuant to Section 2.2(a) shall not be deemed to be effected for purposes of
this Section 2.2 if (i) the Demand Registration Statement for such

thereunder or (ii) no Registrable Securities have been sold under such Demand
Registration Statement.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.2(a), the Company shall not be

shall have a reasonably anticipated net aggregate offering price (after
deduction of underwriting discounts and fees and offering expenses) of less
than $35,000,000, as determined in good faith by the Company at the time of
its receipt of the Demand Registration Notice, or (ii) the Company shall have
consummated a registration of Common Stock under the Securities Act (other

delivery of a Demand Registration Notice.

 



7 (d) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2.4(a), the Company shall
have the right to include in any Demand Registration Statement such number of
shares of Common Stock as it may specify.

2.3 _Piggy-Back Registration_.

(a) If at any time beginning on the Closing Date, the Company shall propose to
file a Registration Statement under the Securities Act relating to a public
offering of Common Stock (other than in connection with an Excluded
Registration) for the Companys own account or for the account of any security
holder (other than the Holder), in each case, on a registration form and in a
manner that would permit the registration of Registrable Securities for sale
to the public under the Securities Act, and the lead managing underwriters of
such offering determine that, in their judgment, the amount of proceeds from
any such offering, after deduction of underwriting discounts and fees, which
may be raised (the " _Proposed Offering Amount_ ") without an Adverse Offering
Effect (as defined below) exceeds the Minimum Primary Offering Amount, the
Company shall (x) give written notice (the " _Primary Offering Notice_ ") at
least 15 Business Days prior to the filing thereof to the Holder, specifying
the approximate date on which the Company proposes to file such Registration
Statement and the Proposed Offering Amount, and advising the Holder of its
right to have any and all of the Registrable Securities included among the
securities to be covered thereby, subject, however, to (A) the limitations
of Section 2.3(b) and Section 2.3(c) (as applicable, the " _Piggyback
Limitations_ ") and (B) reduction in accordance with Section 2.4(b), Section
2.4(c) or Section 2.4(d), as the case may be (as applicable, the "
_Underwriter Cutback_ "), and (y) at the written request of the Holder given
to the Company within ten Business Days after written notice from the Company
has been given to the Holder (a " _Piggyback Registration Notice_ "), include
among the securities covered by such Registration Statement the number of
Registrable Securities which the Holder shall have requested to be so included
in accordance with the Piggyback Limitations and the Underwriter Cutback.

(b) In any Early Initial Offering, the Company shall have the right to include
for the Companys own account such number of shares of Common Stock as shall
be expected to result (in the judgment of the lead managing underwriters of
such offering) in proceeds to the Company, after deduction of underwriting
discounts and fees, equal to the Minimum Primary Offering Amount (the "
_Company Initial Tranche_ "). Upon receipt of a Primary Offering Notice
indicating a Proposed Offering Amount with respect to such Early Initial
Offering that is greater than the Minimum Primary Offering Amount,
Holder shall have the right initially to include in the Early Initial
Offering for the Holders account the number of Registrable Securities that is
equal to the lesser of (x) all Registrable Securities requested by the Holder
to be so included and (y) Registrable Securities with an aggregate offering
value (in the judgment of the lead managing underwriters of such offering and
after deduction of underwriting discounts and fees) equal to the difference
between the Proposed Offering Amount and the Minimum Primary Offering Amount,
subject to any subsequent Underwriter Cutback. Upon receipt of any subsequent
notice from the Company which indicates that in the judgment of the lead
managing underwriters the Proposed Offering Amount may be increased above the
initial Proposed Offering Amount (an " _Upsize Notice_ "), the Holder shall
have the right to include additional Registrable Securities with an aggregate
offering value (in the judgment of the lead managing underwriters of such
offering and after deduction of underwriting discounts and fees) in an amount
up to the amount of the Proposed Offering Amount increase, subject to any
subsequent Underwriter Cutback. If, in any Early Initial Offering,
the aggregate offering value (in the judgment of the lead managing
underwriters of such offering and after deduction of underwriting discounts
and fees) of (x) the Company Initial Tranche plus (y) the Registrable
Securities to be included in such

 



8  Early Initial Offering in accordance with this Section 2.3(b) (collectively,
the " _Combined Tranche_ ") is less than the Proposed Offering Amount, before
or after delivery of any Upsize Notice, the Company shall have the right to
include for the Companys own account additional shares of Common Stock with
an aggregate offering value (in the judgment of the lead managing underwriters
of such offering and after deduction of underwriting discounts and fees) in
an amount up to the difference between the Proposed Offering Amount and the
Combined Tranche, subject to any subsequent Underwriter Cutback.

 

(c) In any Later Initial Offering in which the Proposed Offering Amount shall
be less than or equal to $250 million (the " _Full Liquidity Level_ "), the
Company shall have the right to include for the Companys own account at least
60% of the total number of shares of Common Stock to be offered in such Later
Initial Offering. Upon receipt of a Primary Offering Notice (or an Upsize
Notice) with respect to such Later Initial Offering indicating a Proposed
Offering Amount with respect to such Later Initial Offering that is less than
or equal to the Full Liquidity Level, the Holder shall have the right
to include Registrable Securities constituting up to 40% of the total number
of shares of Common Stock to be offered in such Later Initial Offering. In the
event that (x) the initial Proposed Offering Amount for such Later Initial
Offering is greater than the Full Liquidity Level, (y) the Holder shall not
exercise in full the Holders right to include Registrable Securities in the
Later Initial Offering, or (z) in the judgment of the lead managing
underwriters the Proposed Offering Amount may be increased above the initial
Proposed Offering Amount and such increase shall result in an aggregate
offering value greater than the Full Liquidity Level, the Company shall have
the right to include for the Companys own account a total number of shares
of Common Stock with an aggregate offering value (in the judgment of the lead
managing underwriters of such offering and after deduction of underwriting
discounts and fees) equal to (A) the final Proposed Offering Amount less (B)
the aggregate offering value (in the judgment of the lead managing
underwriters of such offering and after deduction of underwriting discounts
and fees) of the Registrable Securities to be offered in such Later
Initial Offering.

(d) Nothing in this Section 2.3 shall create any liability on the part of the
Company to the Holder if for any reason the Company shall decide not to file,
or to delay the filing of, a Registration Statement proposed to be filed
pursuant to Section 2.2(a) or Section 2.3(a) or to withdraw such Registration
Statement subsequent to the filing thereof, regardless of any action
whatsoever that the Holder may have taken, whether as a result of the issuance
by the Company of any notice hereunder or otherwise, _provided_ that the
Company shall not be relieved of its obligation hereunder to pay
the Registration Expenses in connection with any such filing or proposed
filing.

2.4 _Cutbacks_.

 

(a) In connection with any offering covered by a Demand Registration Statement
filed pursuant to Section 2.2(a), if the lead managing underwriters of such
offering shall give written notice (a " _Cutback Notice_ ") to the Company
(which Cutback Notice the Company shall deliver to the Holder as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter) that, in their judgment
(and notwithstanding any Proposed Offering Amount determined for such
offering), the Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
offering and any shares of Common Stock which the Company proposes to sell for
its own account in such offering exceed the number which can be sold in such
offering without being reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
the offering price, timing or distribution of the shares offered or the market
for the shares offered (an " _Adverse Offering Effect_ "), the Company shall
include in such offering only the number of Registrable Securities and such
other shares that, in the judgment of such underwriters, can be included
without being reasonably likely to have an Adverse Offering Effect, in
accordance with this Section 2.4.

 



9 (b) In the event that, after the Holder delivers a Piggyback Registration
Notice but before the consummation of an Early Initial Offering, the lead
managing underwriters thereof shall give a Cutback Notice to the Company
(which Cutback Notice the Company shall deliver to the Holder as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter) with respect to a reduction of the Early
Initial Offering amount, the number of shares of Common Stock initially
included for the account of the Company and the number of Registrable
Securities initially included for the account of the Holder shall be reduced
pro-rata based on the numbers of shares of Common Stock initially included for
the accounts of the Company and the Holder, respectively, _provided_ that, if
such a pro-rata reduction would result in the Company receiving less than the
Minimum Primary Offering Amount, in the judgment of the lead managing
underwriters of the Early Initial Offering, the number of Registrable
Securities to be included in the Early Initial Offering shall be reduced to an
amount that would result in the Company receiving at least the Minimum Primary
Offering Amount, in the judgment of the lead managing underwriters of the
Early Initial Offering, even if such reduction shall require the exclusion
from the Early Initial Offering of more Registrable Securities than shares of
Common Stock to be offered therein for the Companys account. For purposes of
illustration only, if 2,000,000 shares and 1,000,000 shares were initially
included in the Early Initial Offering for the accounts of the Company and the
Holder, respectively, a pro-rata reduction of a total of 600,000
shares specified in the Cutback Notice shall require a reduction of 400,000
shares to be offered for the account of the Company and 200,000 shares to be
offered for the account of the Holder. If, however, in the judgment of the
lead managing underwriters of the Early Initial Offering (after taking into
account a pro-rata reduction of 600,000 shares provided for in the Cutback
Notice in order to avoid an Adverse Offering Effect, and for purposes of
illustration with respect to an Early Initial Offering only), (A) the sale of
1,600,000 shares would be expected to yield an amount of net proceeds, after
deduction of underwriting discounts and fees, of less than the Minimum Primary
Offering Amount, and (B) the sale of 1,800,000 shares for the account of the
Company would be necessary to yield an amount of net proceeds to the Company,
after deduction of underwriting discounts and fees, exactly equal to the
Minimum Primary Offering Amount, then the Early Initial Offering shall
include (i) 1,800,000 shares for the account of the Company (reflecting a
reduction in shares offered for the account of the Company of 200,000 shares),
and (ii) 600,000 shares for the account of the Holder (reflecting a reduction
in shares offered for the account of the Holder of 400,000 shares), for a
total of 2,400,000 shares to be included in the Early Initial Offering.

 

(c) In the event that, after the Holder delivers a Piggyback Registration
Notice but before the consummation of a Later Initial Offering, the lead
managing underwriters thereof shall give a Cutback Notice to the Company
(which Cutback Notice the Company shall deliver to the Holder as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter) with respect to a reduction of the Later
Initial Offering amount, the number of shares of Common Stock initially
included for the account of the Company and the number of Registrable
Securities initially included for the account of the Holder shall be
reduced pro-rata based on the numbers of shares of Common Stock initially
included for the accounts of the Company and the Holder, respectively. For
purposes of illustration only, if 1,500,000 shares and 1,000,000 shares were
initially included in the Later Initial Offering for the accounts of the
Company and the Holder, respectively, a pro-rata reduction of a total of
600,000 shares specified in the Cutback Notice shall require a reduction of
360,000 shares to be offered for the account of the Company and 240,000 shares
to be offered for the account of the Holder.

 



10 (d) In connection with the inclusion of Registrable Securities pursuant to
Section 2.3(a) in any Subsequent Offering, if the lead managing underwriters
of an Underwritten Offering deliver a Cutback Notice to the Company (which
Cutback Notice the Company shall deliver to the Holder as soon as reasonably
practicable thereafter), the Company shall include in such offering the
shares of Common Stock the Company proposes to sell for its own account or for
the account of any security holder (other than the Holder) and the shares of
Registrable Securities requested to be included pursuant to Section 2.3(a)
that, in the judgment of such lead managing underwriters, can be included
without being reasonably likely to have an Adverse Offering Effect. In such
event, the shares of Common Stock proposed to be included for the account of
the Company and the number of Registrable Securities designated in the
Piggyback Registration Notice shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis.

 

2.5 _Selection of Underwriters_. In connection with any Demand Registration
Statement filed pursuant to Section 2.2(a), the Holder shall have the right
to select a lead managing underwriter or underwriters to administer such
offering exclusively from among at least four underwriting firms which the
Company shall designate in a writing delivered to the Holder. Any such list
of underwriting firms shall include J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated and Morgan Stanley and Co, or
comparable investment banking firms of nationally recognized standing.

 

2.6 _Blackout Periods; Holdback_.

 

(a) If the Company determines that the registration and distribution of
Registrable Securities (i) would materially impede, delay, interfere with or
otherwise adversely affect any pending financing, registration of securities
by the Company in a primary offering for its own account, acquisition,
corporate reorganization, debt restructuring or other significant
transaction involving the Company or (ii) would require disclosure of
material non-public information that the Company has a _bona fide_ business
purpose for preserving as confidential, as determined by the Company in good
faith, the Company shall be entitled to defer the filing or effectiveness of
a Registration Statement, or to suspend the use of an effective Registration
Statement, for the shortest period of time reasonably required (each such
period, a " _Blackout Period_ ")  _provided_ that the Company shall not be
entitled to obtain deferrals or suspensions under (x) clause (i) of this
Section 2.7(a), for more than an aggregate of 120 days in any 12-month period
or (y) clause (ii) of this Section 2.7(a), for more than 30 days on any one
occasion, on more than two occasions in any 12-month period or for more than
an aggregate of 60 days in any 12-month period. The Company shall not under
any circumstances be entitled to obtain deferrals or suspensions for more than
an aggregate of 120 days in any 12-month period. The Company shall notify the
Holder of the initiation and expiration or earlier termination of a Blackout
Period and, as soon as reasonably practicable after such expiration or
termination, shall amend or supplement any effective Registration Statement to
the extent necessary to permit the Holder to resume use thereof in connection
with the offer and sale of the Registrable Securities in accordance with
applicable law. The Holder agrees to treat as confidential the delivery of any
notice by the Company to the Holder pursuant to this Section 2.6(a) and the
information set forth in any such notice. The Company shall extend by the
number of days in any Blackout Period the period during which any effective
Demand Registration Statement is required to be maintained effective as
provided in Section 2.7(b).

 

(b) In the case of an Underwritten Offering of securities of the Company, the
Holder agrees, if and only if requested in writing by the lead managing
underwriter or underwriters of such Underwritten Offering, to enter into a
customary lock-up agreement with the Company and the

 



11  underwriters of such Underwritten Offering in which the Holder shall agree
that it shall not effect any Lock-up Period Transactions during the period
beginning seven days before, and ending 90 days (or such shorter period as
may be permitted by such lead managing underwriters) after, the effective date
of the Registration Statement filed in connection with such registration,
except for the offering and sale of Registrable Securities included in such
registration and except for such other transactions as are customarily
excepted from such lock-up.

(c) In the case of any Underwritten Offering of Registrable Securities
initiated by a Holder pursuant to 
Section 2.2(a), the Company agrees, if requested in writing by the lead
managing underwriter or underwriters of such Underwritten Offering, not to
effect (or register for sale) any public sale or distribution of Common Stock
or other securities that are Similar Securities for the Companys own account
during the period beginning seven days before, and ending 90 days (or such
lesser period as may be permitted by such lead managing underwriter) after,
the effective date of the Registration Statement filed in connection with such
registration, except for securities of the Company to be offered for the
Companys account in such Underwritten Offering. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company may effect a public sale or distribution of Common
Stock and other securities that are Similar Securities for the Companys own
account during the period described above (i) pursuant to registrations on
Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor registration forms under the Securities Act,
(ii) as part of any registration of securities for offering and sale solely to
employees, directors or consultants of the Company pursuant to any stock plan
or other benefit plan arrangement or (iii) pursuant to a Rule 144A Resale
Shelf Registration.

2.7  _Registration Procedures_. In connection with the registration
obligations of the Company under Sections 2.2 and 2.3, the Company shall:

 

(a) prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement with respect to the
Registrable Securities on any registration form adopted by the SEC for which
the Company then qualifies or which counsel for the Company shall deem
appropriate and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration
Statement to become and remain effective, _provided_ that, at least
five Business Days prior to filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus or
any amendment or supplement thereto, the Company shall furnish to a single
counsel selected by the Holder copies of such Registration Statement or
Prospectus (or amendment or supplement) as proposed to be filed (including,
upon the request of such counsel, documents to be incorporated by reference
therein), which documents shall be subject to the reasonable review and
comments of such counsel and the Holder;

 

(b) prepare and file with the SEC amendments and post-effective amendments to
such Registration Statement and such amendments and supplements to the
Prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration or as may be required by the rules,
regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form utilized by
the Company or by the Securities Act or rules and regulations thereunder
necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective until the earlier of
(i) the date on which the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration
Statement cease to be Registrable Securities or have been sold pursuant to,
or withdrawn from, such registration and (ii) subject to Sections 2.6(a),
2.7(e) and 2.7(k), in the case of a Demand Registration Statement filed
pursuant to Section 2.2(a), for such period (not to exceed 90 days after the
effective date thereof) as, in the opinion of counsel for the underwriter or
underwriters of the Underwritten Offering thereunder, is required by law for
the delivery of a Prospectus in connection with the sale of Registrable
Securities by an underwriter or dealer, and cause the Prospectus as so amended
and supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the

 



12  Securities Act, and otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to comply
with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of
all securities covered by such Registration Statement until such time as is
specified in clause (i) or (ii) above, as the case may be;

(c) furnish to the Holder such number of copies of such Registration
Statement and of each amendment and post-effective amendment thereto, any
Prospectus or Prospectus supplement and such other documents as the Holder may
reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable
Securities by the Holder (the Company hereby consenting to the use (subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 2.8(b)) of the Prospectus or any
amendment or supplement thereto in connection with such disposition);

(d) use commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement under such other securities
or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Holder shall reasonably request,
and to do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary
to enable the Holder to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of
such Registrable Securities, except that the Company shall not be required for
any such purpose to qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation
in any jurisdiction where, but for the requirements of this Section 2.7(d),
it would not be obligated to be so qualified, to subject itself to taxation in
any such jurisdiction, or to consent to general service of process in any such
jurisdiction;

 

(e) promptly notify the Holder, at any time when a Prospectus relating thereto
is required to be delivered under the Securities Act within the applicable
period referred to in Section 2.7(b), that the Company has become aware that
the Prospectus included in such Registration Statement, as then in effect,
includes an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then
existing (the period during which the Holder is required in such case pursuant
to Section 2.8(b) to refrain from effecting public sales or distributions of
Registrable Securities referred to herein as a " _Section 2.7(e) Suspension
Period_ "), and prepare and furnish to the Holder, as soon as reasonably
practicable, without charge to the Holder, a reasonable number of copies of
an amendment to such Registration Statement or supplement to such related
Prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the
purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such Prospectus shall not include
an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing, _provided_
that if the Company gives such notice, the Company shall extend the period
during which such Registration Statement is required to be maintained
effective as provided in Section 2.7(b) by the number of days in the Section
2.7(e) Suspension Period;

(f) promptly notify the Holder:

 

(i) when the Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment has been filed and, with respect to the Registration Statement or
any post-effective amendment, when the Registration Statement or such post-
effective amendment has become effective;

 

(ii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order of which the Company is
aware suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any order
preventing the use of a related Prospectus, or the initiation of any
proceedings for such purposes; and

 



13 (iii) of the receipt by the Company of any written notification of the
suspension of the qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale
in any jurisdiction or the initiation of any proceeding for such purpose;

 

(g) make available to its stockholders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an
earnings statement that shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the
Securities Act, _provided_ that the Company shall be deemed to have complied
with this Section 2.7(g) if it has complied with Rule 158 under the Securities
Act;

 

(h) if the registration involves an Underwritten Offering, enter into a
customary underwriting agreement and in connection therewith:

 

 (i) make such representations and warranties to the underwriters in form and,
to the extent possible, substance and scope as are customarily made by
issuers to underwriters in comparable Underwritten Offerings;

 (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain opinions of counsel to
the Company (in form, scope and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
managing underwriters), addressed to the underwriters, and covering the
matters customarily covered in opinions requested in comparable Underwritten
Offerings;

 (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain "comfort" letters and
bring-downs thereof from the Companys independent registered public
accounting firm addressed to the underwriters, such letters to be in customary
form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "comfort" letters
by independent registered public accounting firms in connection with
Underwritten Offerings; and

 (iv) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested
by the managing underwriters to evidence compliance with any customary
conditions contained in the underwriting agreement;

 

(i) cooperate with the Holder and the managing underwriter or underwriters or
agents, if any, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of
certificates (not bearing any restrictive legends) representing the securities
to be sold under such Registration Statement, and enable such securities to be
in such denominations and registered in such names as the managing
underwriter or underwriters or agents, if any, or the Holder may request;

(j) if reasonably requested by the managing underwriter or underwriters
or the Holder, incorporate in a Prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment to the Registration Statement such information as the managing
underwriters and the Holder agree should be included therein relating to the
plan of distribution with respect to the Registrable Securities being offered
thereby and make all required filings of such Prospectus supplement or post-
effective amendment upon being notified of the matters to be incorporated in
such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment;

(k) in the event of the issuance of any stop order of which the Company is
aware suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, or of any
order suspending or preventing the use of any related Prospectus or suspending
the qualification of any Registrable Securities included in the Registration
Statement for sale in any jurisdiction, use commercially reasonable

 



14  efforts to obtain at the earliest practicable time the withdrawal of such
stop order or other order (the period between the issuance and withdrawal of
any stop order or other order referred to herein as a _"Section 2.7(k)
Suspension Period_ "), _provided_ that the Company shall extend the period
during which such Registration Statement is required to be maintained
effective as provided in Section 2.8(b) by the number of days in the Section
2.7(k) Suspension Period;

(l) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Common Stock covered by
such Registration Statement to be listed on any securities exchange on which
the Common Stock is then listed, if the Common Stock covered by such
Registration Statement is not already so listed and if such listing is then
permitted under the rules of such securities exchange;

(m) in the case of an Underwritten Offering, cause the senior executive
officers of the Company to participate in the customary "road show"
presentations (including "electronic road show" presentations) that may be
reasonably requested by the lead managing underwriter or underwriters in any
such Underwritten Offering and otherwise to cooperate with and participate in
customary selling efforts related thereto;

(n) provide a CUSIP number for all Registrable Securities and, unless such
Registrable Securities shall be registered in book-entry form, provide the
applicable transfer agent and registrar for such Registrable Securities with
printed certificates for the Registrable Securities, which certificates shall
be in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company;

(o) provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and registrar for all
Registrable Securities covered by the applicable Registration Statement from
and after a date not later than the effective date of such Registration
Statement; and

 

(p) make available upon reasonable notice at reasonable times and for
reasonable periods for inspection by one representative appointed by the
Holder, by any managing underwriter or underwriters participating in any
Underwritten Offering to be effected pursuant to such Registration Statement,
and by any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by the Holder or any
such managing underwriter, all pertinent financial and other records,
pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company, and use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all of the Companys officers,
directors and employees and the independent registered public accounting firm
that has certified the Companys financial statements to make themselves
available during normal business hours to discuss the business of the Company
and to supply all information reasonably requested by the Holder or managing
underwriter or agent thereof in connection with such Registration Statement as
shall be necessary to enable such Persons to exercise their due diligence
responsibility (subject to the entry by each Person referred to in
this Section 2.7(p) into customary confidentiality agreements in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Company).

2.8 _Agreements of Holder_.

(a) As a condition to the Companys obligation under this Agreement to cause
Registrable Securities to be included in a Registration Statement, the Holder
shall timely provide the Company with all of the information required to be
provided in the Registration Statement with respect to the Holder pursuant to
Items 507 and 508 (or any successor Items) of Regulation S-K under the
Securities Act and such other information with respect to the Holder as shall
be required to be included in such Registration Statement pursuant to the
Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.

 



15 (b) The Holder shall comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of the
Securities Act in connection with the offer and sale of Registrable
Securities made by the Holder pursuant to any Registration Statement. Upon
receipt of any notice from the Company of the occurrence of any event of the
kind described in Section 2.7(e) or Section 2.7(k), the Holder shall
forthwith discontinue the disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to
the Prospectus or Registration Statement covering such Registrable Securities
until the Holders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended
Prospectus contemplated by Section 2.7(e) or the withdrawal of any stop order
or other order referred to in Section 2.7(k), and, if so directed by the
Company, shall deliver to the Company all copies, other than permanent file
copies then in the Holders possession, of the Prospectus covering such
Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such notice.

 

(c) To the extent required by the Securities Act or rules or regulations
thereunder, as reasonably determined by the Company, the Holder shall consent
to disclosure in any Registration Statement to the effect that the Holder is
or may be deemed to be an underwriter for purposes of the Securities Act in
connection with the offering of Registrable Securities by the Holder.

 

(d) The Holder shall (i) comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act in
connection with the offer and sale of Registrable Securities made by the
Holder pursuant to any Registration Statement and (ii) provide the Company
with such information about the Holders offer and sale of Registrable
Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement as the Company shall
reasonably request to enable the Company and its Affiliates to comply with
Regulation M under the Exchange Act in connection with any such offer and
sale.

 

2.9 _Registration Expenses_. The Company shall pay all Registration Expenses
in connection with all registrations pursuant to this Agreement to the extent
provided herein. In connection with all such registrations, the Holder shall
pay all underwriting discounts and fees, brokerage and sales commissions, and
transfer and documentary stamp taxes, if any, relating to the sale
or disposition of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration
Statement, and, except as provided in clause (g) of the definition of
Registration Expenses, all fees and expenses of counsel for the Holder.

 

2.10 _Indemnification; Contribution_.

 

(a) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the Holder in any offering or sale of
Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement, each Person, if any, who
participates as an underwriter in any such offering and sale of Registrable
Securities, and each Person, if any, who controls the Holder or such
underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section
20 of the Exchange Act and their respective directors, trustees, officers,
partners, agents, employees and affiliates against all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees,
disbursements and expenses, as incurred, and any amounts paid in any
settlement effected with the Companys consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) (collectively, " _Losses_ ") incurred by
such party pursuant to any actual or threatened action, suit, proceeding or
investigation arising out of or based upon: (i) any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in, or any omission or alleged
omission of a material fact required to be stated in, the Registration
Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment or supplement
to any of the foregoing, any Free Writing Prospectus or any
"issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d)
under the Securities Act, or necessary to make the statements therein (in the
case of a Prospectus, a preliminary Prospectus, a Free Writing Prospectus or
"issuer information," in the light

 



16  of the circumstances then existing) not misleading, except in each case
insofar as such statements or omissions arise out of or are based upon (A) any
such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission made in reliance on and in conformity with information with respect
to the Holder furnished in writing to the Company by the Holder or its counsel
expressly for use therein, (B) the use of any Prospectus, Free Writing
Prospectus or "issuer information" after such time as the obligation of the
Company to keep effective the Registration Statement of which such Prospectus
forms a part has expired or (C) the use of any Prospectus, Free Writing
Prospectus or "issuer information" after such time as the Company has advised
the Holder that the filing of an amendment or supplement thereto is required,
except such Prospectus, Free Writing Prospectus or "issuer information" as so
amended or supplemented; or (ii) any violation by the Company of any other
federal or state securities laws or regulations applicable to the Company and
relating to action required of or inaction by the Company in connection with
any such registration. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.10(a), the Company shall not be liable to the Holder or any
underwriter or to any other indemnified party under the indemnity
agreement in this Section 2.10(a) for any Losses that arise out of or are
based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission made in any Prospectus if either: (i) (A) the Holder or such
underwriter failed to send or deliver a copy of the Prospectus prior to the
time of the sale of Registrable Securities by the Holder or such underwriter
to the Person asserting the claim from which such Losses arise and (B) the
Prospectus would have corrected such untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or such omission or alleged omission; or (ii) (A) such untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission is
corrected in an amendment or supplement to the Prospectus and (B) having
previously been furnished by or on behalf of the Company with copies of the
Prospectus as so amended or supplemented as required hereunder, the Holder or
such underwriter thereafter fails to deliver such Prospectus, as so
amended or supplemented, prior to the time of the sale of Registrable
Securities by the Holder or underwriter to the Person asserting the claim from
which such Losses arise. Such rights to indemnity and reimbursement of
expenses shall survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities by such
indemnified party.

(b) In connection with any Registration Statement filed pursuant to
this Agreement, the Holder shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the Company, each Person, if any, who participates as
an underwriter in any such offering and sale of Registrable Securities and
each Person, if any, who controls the Company or such underwriter within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act,
and their respective directors, trustees, officers, partners, agents,
employees and affiliates, against all Losses incurred by such party pursuant
to any actual action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or
based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained
in, or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be
stated in, the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or
any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing, any Free Writing
Prospectus or "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to
Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or necessary to make the statements
therein (in case of a Prospectus, preliminary Prospectus or Free Writing
Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances then existing) not misleading,
but only to the extent that any such untrue statement or omission is made in
reliance on and in conformity with information with respect to the Holder
furnished in writing to the Company by the Holder or its counsel specifically
for use therein, _provided_  that the Holder shall not be required to
indemnify the Company or any other indemnified party under this Section
2.10(b) with respect to any amount in excess of the amount of the total net
proceeds received by the Holder from sales of the Registrable Securities
under such Registration Statement.

 



17 (c) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder agrees to give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party after the receipt by such
indemnified party of any written notice of the commencement of any action,
suit, proceeding or investigation or threat thereof made in writing for which
such indemnified party may claim indemnification or contribution pursuant to
this Agreement, _provided_ that failure to give such notification shall not
affect the obligations of the indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.10
except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been actually and
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. In case any such action
shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the
indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall
be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish,
jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the
defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified
party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party
of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall
not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than
reasonable costs of investigation, unless in the reasonable judgment of any
indemnified party, based on the opinion of counsel, a conflict of interest is
likely to exist between the indemnifying party and such indemnified party and
any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim, in which
event the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of
(i) more than one counsel for the Holder (which selection shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Company), (ii) more than one counsel for the underwriters
in an Underwritten Offering or (iii) more than one counsel for the Company, in
each case in connection with any one action or separate but similar or
related actions. An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not
to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and
expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such
indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable
judgment of any indemnified party, based on the opinion of counsel, a conflict
of interest is likely to exist between an indemnified party and any other of
such indemnified parties with respect to such claim, in which event the
indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of such
additional counsel, _provided_ that the indemnifying party shall not be liable
for the fees and expenses of (i) more than one counsel for the Holder (which
selection shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company), (ii) more than one
counsel for the underwriters in an Underwritten Offering or (iii) more than
one counsel for the Company, in each case in connection with any one action
or separate but similar or related actions. No indemnifying party, in defense
of any such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall, except with the
consent of each indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or
entry into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a
release from all liability in respect to such action, suit, proceeding or
investigation to the extent such liability is covered by the indemnity
obligations set forth in this Section 2.10. No indemnified party shall consent
to entry of any judgment or entry into any settlement without the consent of
each indemnifying party.

(d) If the indemnification from the indemnifying party provided for in
this Section 2.10 is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect
of any Losses, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such
indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party as a result of such Losses in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and
indemnified party in connection with the actions which resulted in such
Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations, _provided_
that the Holder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of
the amount of the total net proceeds received by the Holder from sales of the
Registrable Securities under the applicable Registration Statement. The
relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified

 



18  party shall be determined by reference to, among other matters, whether any
action in question, including any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact,
has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying
party or indemnified party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge,
access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The
amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the Losses referred to above
shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section
2.10(c), any legal or other fees and expenses reasonably incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. No
Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The
parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant
to this Section 2.10(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other
method of allocation that does not take into account the consideration
referred to in this Section 2.10(d). If indemnification is available under
this Section 2.10, the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified
party to the full extent provided in Section 2.10(a) or 2.10(b), as the case
may be, without regard to the relative fault of such indemnifying parties or
indemnified party or any other equitable consideration provided for in this
Section 2.10(d).

 

(e) The provisions of this Section 2.10 shall be in addition to any liability
which any indemnifying party may have to any indemnified party and shall
survive the termination of this Agreement.

(f) The indemnification and contribution required by this Section 2.10 shall
be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of any
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, as and when invoices are received
or Losses are incurred.

 

2.11 _Participation in Underwritten Offerings_. The Holder may not participate
in any Underwritten Offering pursuant to this Agreement unless the Holder (a)
agrees to sell the Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any
underwriting arrangements approved by the Company, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (b) completes and executes
all customary questionnaires, powers of attorney, custody agreements,
indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required
under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

 

2.12 _Reports Under the Exchange Act_. For so long as any Registrable
Securities remain outstanding and the Company is required under the Exchange
Act and rules and regulations thereunder to file with the SEC reports pursuant
to Section 13 or 15(a) of the Exchange Act, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to file such reports with the SEC in a timely manner.

 

2.13 _No Inconsistent Agreements_. The Company shall not after the date of
this Agreement enter into any agreement which is inconsistent with the rights
granted pursuant to this Agreement to the Holder. The Holder agrees for
purposes of this Section 2.13 that a registration rights agreement in
customary form relating to a Rule 144A Resale Shelf Registration shall not be
deemed inconsistent with the rights of the Holder hereunder.

 



19 2.14 _Assignment of Registration Rights_.

 



(a) The right to cause the Company to register Registrable
Securities pursuant to this Agreement may not be assigned by the Holder.

(b) In connection with any merger, consolidation, reorganization or similar
transaction involving the Company (i) in which the Company is not the
surviving corporation or entity or (ii) which results in the Company becoming
the wholly-owned subsidiary of another corporation or other entity,
effective provision shall be made in the instruments pursuant to which such
transaction shall be consummated so that the surviving corporation (in the
case of a transaction of the type specified in clause (i)) or the entity which
becomes the wholly-owned parent of the Company (in the case of a transaction
of the type specified in clause (ii)) shall expressly assume the obligations
of the Company hereunder effective upon the consummation of such transaction.
In such event, all references herein to the Company shall thereafter be
references to the assuming entity and all references to the Common Stock shall
thereafter be references to the class of equity securities (if any) of the
assuming entity issued to all holders of the Common Stock as consideration
pursuant to such transaction.

ARTICLE 3

 

3.1 _Voting_. At all times prior to the Registration Rights Termination Time,
the Seller shall take all such action as may be required so that, solely with
respect to any matter referred to in Rule 14a-6(a) under the Exchange Act to
be voted on by the Companys stockholders (assuming that the exclusion from
filing preliminary proxy material referred to therein shall apply), all
Purchaser Shares beneficially owned by the Seller and its Affiliates are voted
either (a) in accordance with the recommendations of the Company Board or (b)
for or against any such matter in the same proportion as the shares owned by
all other stockholders (excluding the Seller and each of its Affiliates that
is a stockholder of the Company) are voted with respect to such matter. The
Seller and all Affiliates of the Seller beneficially owning any Purchaser
Shares shall be present (or shall cause all record holders of such Purchaser
Shares to be present), in person or by proxy, at all meetings of stockholders
of the Company so that all such Purchaser Shares beneficially owned by
the Seller and any such Affiliate may be counted for the purposes of
determining the presence of a quorum at such meeting.

TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

 

4.1 _Lock-up_. For a period of 180 days following the Closing Date, and except
as otherwise provided by this Agreement, the Holder shall not, directly or
indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Company, Transfer any of
the Purchaser Shares or any options or warrants to purchase any Purchaser
Shares, or any securities convertible into, exchangeable for or that
represent the right to receive the Purchaser Shares or engage in any hedging
or other transaction which is designed to or which reasonably could be
expected to lead to or result in a sale or disposition of the Purchaser
Shares. However, nothing in this Section 4.1 shall prevent or restrict the
Holder from (a) Transferring any Purchaser Shares in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and/or (b) pledging any of the Purchaser Shares to any _bona
fide_ Third Party lender or Transferring Purchaser Shares in connection with
a sale of the Company approved by the Board of Directors of the Company
(whether by merger, consolidation, sale of shares of capital stock, other
business combination transaction, sale of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company or otherwise) or a tender or

 



20  exchange offer for all of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock;
_provided_ that, in each such case, it shall be a condition to any such
Transfer that (a) the lender or transferee either execute and deliver an
investor representation letter in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
the Company and (b) there shall be no further Transfer of such Purchaser
Shares except in accordance with the lock-up provisions of this Section 4.1.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 4.1 shall be construed to
apply to any shares of capital stock of the Company owned by the Holder other
than the Purchaser Shares.

 

4.2 _Compliance with Law_.

 

(a) The Seller shall, and shall ensure that any of its Affiliates acquiring
Purchaser Shares shall, observe and comply with the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and applicable state securities laws, and the rules and
regulations promulgated under all such laws, and all other Requirements of Law
in connection with any permitted Transfer of Purchaser Shares, including,
without limitation, all Requirements of Law relating to the use of insider
information or the trading of securities while in the possession of material
non-public information.

 

(b) In furtherance of the foregoing, and in addition to the restrictions
specified above, the Seller shall not, and shall ensure that any of its
Affiliates acquiring Purchaser Shares do not, Transfer any Purchaser Shares
unless at such time at least one of the following is satisfied:

 

(i) a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Purchaser
Shares proposed to be Transferred, describing the manner and terms of the
proposed sale, transfer or other disposition, and containing a current
prospectus, shall have been filed with the SEC and made effective under the
Securities Act;

 

(ii) counsel representing the Seller or such Affiliate, as the case may be,
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, shall have advised the Company in a
written opinion letter reasonably satisfactory to the Company and its counsel,
and upon which the Company and its counsel may rely, that no registration
under the Securities Act would be required in connection with the proposed
Transfer; or

(iii) an authorized representative of the SEC shall have rendered written
advice to the Seller or such Affiliate (requested by the Seller or such
Affiliate or counsel to the Seller or such Affiliate, with a copy thereof and
of all other related communications delivered to the Company) to the effect
that the SEC would take no action, or that the staff of the SEC would not
recommend that the SEC take action, with respect to the proposed Transfer.

4.3 _Restrictive Legend_.

 

Each certificate evidencing the Purchaser Shares shall bear the following
restrictive legend, either as an endorsement or on the face thereof, until,
in the reasonable judgment of the Company, the Transfer of the Purchaser
Shares shall not be subject to restrictions under the Securities Act:
