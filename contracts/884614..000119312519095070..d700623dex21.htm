the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Units in exchange for the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of Public Common Units represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Units, as applicable, which may have been
previously surrendered in connection with an Election. Promptly after the
Effective Time, upon surrender of Certificates, if any, for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent together with such letters of transmittal, properly
completed and duly executed, and such other documents (including in respect of
Book-Entry Units) as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions,
each holder who held Public Common Units immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be entitled to receive upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Units therefor (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) (A) New
Parent Shares representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of New Parent
Shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article
III_ (after taking into account all Public Common Units then held by such
holder) and/or (B) a check in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of cash
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article III_ ,
including (x) cash in an amount equal to the product of (A) the number of
Public Common Units represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Units in the name of such holder multiplied by (B)
the Cash Consideration or the cash portion of the Mixed Consideration, if and
as applicable, (y) cash payable in lieu of any fractional New Parent Shares
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(d)_ and (z) dividends pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 3.3(c)_, if any. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration, any cash payment in lieu of fractional New Parent Shares, or
any Parent dividends payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(c)_. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Public Common Units that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Partnership, the Merger

 



17

    

 Consideration payable in respect of such Public Common Units may be paid to
a transferee, if the Certificate representing such Public Common Units or
evidence of ownership of the Book-Entry Units is presented to the Exchange
Agent, and in the case of both certificated and book-entry Public Common
Units, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect
such transfer, and the Person requesting such exchange will pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of
the delivery of the Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the
record holder of such Public Common Units, or will establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not
payable. Until all such required documentation has been delivered and
Certificates, if any, have been surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_
__ _ 3.3_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Unit will be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration upon such delivery and surrender, and any cash or dividends or
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.3(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.3(d)_.

 

(c) _Dividends with Respect to_ _Unexchanged_ _Public Common Units_. No
dividends declared or made with respect to Parent Shares with a record date
after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any Public Common Units
with respect to New Parent Shares that such holder would be entitled to
receive in accordance herewith, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional New
Parent Shares nor any part of the Merger Consideration, will be paid to any
such holder until such holder has delivered the required documentation and
surrendered any Certificates or Book-Entry Units as contemplated by this 
_Section_ __ _ 3.3_. Subject to applicable Law, following compliance with the
requirements of _Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)_, there will be paid to such holder of
New Parent Shares issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i)
promptly after the time of such compliance, the amount of any cash payable in
lieu of fractional New Parent Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(d)_ (which shall be paid by the Exchange Agent as
provided therein) and the amount of dividends with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to New Parent Shares and payable
with respect to such New Parent Shares, and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends with a record date after the Effective Time but
prior to such delivery and surrender and a payment date subsequent to such
compliance payable with respect to such New Parent Shares (which shall be paid
by Parent).

(d) _No Fractional New Parent Shares_. No certificates or scrip for New
Parent Shares representing fractional New Parent Shares or book entry credit
of the same will be issued upon the surrender of Public Common Units
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)_, and such fractional interests will not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any New Parent
Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
Public Common Units converted in the Merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a New Parent Share (after taking into
account all Public Common Units exchanged by such holder) will receive, in
lieu thereof, cash (without interest rounded up to the nearest whole cent) in
an amount equal to the product of (i) the Average Closing Price as of the
Closing Date and (ii) the fraction of a New Parent Share that such holder
would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article III_. As
promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, Parent will cause the
Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests
subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof.

 



18

    

(e) _No Further Rights in Public_ _Common Units_. The Merger
Consideration issued upon conversion of a Public Common Unit in accordance
with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.3(d)_) will be deemed to have been issued and/or paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such Public Common Unit (other than any
distribution in respect of the Common Units with a record date occurring prior
to the Effective Time that may have been declared by the Partnership on the
Common Units in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Partnership Agreement and which remains unpaid at the Effective Time).

 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Public Common Units after 180 days
following the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand by Parent
and, from and after such delivery, any former holders of Public Common Units
who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ will thereafter
look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration or other consideration as
applicable, payable in respect of such Public Common Units, any cash in lieu
of fractional New Parent Shares to which they are entitled pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(d)_, or any dividends with respect to New Parent Shares to
which they are entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(c)_, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of
Public Common Units immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority
will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of Parent. Without limitation of the foregoing, after 180 days following the
Effective Time, any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Public Common
Units will become the property of Parent, subject to the legitimate claims of
any Person previously entitled thereto hereunder or under abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the Partnership, Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Entity, the General Partner, the Exchange Agent, or any other Person shall be
liable to any former holder of Public Common Units for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate is lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of an indemnity agreement or a
bond, in a customary amount, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate and affidavit the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of Public Common Units represented by
such Certificate, and any amounts to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.3(d)_.

 

(h) _Withholding_. The Partnership, Holdings, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Exchange Agent are entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts or
securities as the Partnership, Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent reasonably deems to be required to deduct and withhold under the Code
or any provision of state, local, or foreign tax Law, with respect to the
making of such payment or issuance. To the extent that amounts or securities
are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid or issued to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made. If withholding is taken in securities, the Partnership,
Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be
treated as having sold such consideration for an amount of cash equal to the
fair market value of such consideration at the time of such deemed sale and
paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate Governmental Authority.

 



19

    

(i) _Book Entry Shares_. All New Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger
will be issued in book-entry form, without physical certificates.

(j) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. Parent will cause the Exchange
Agent to invest the cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily
basis, in Parents sole discretion; _provided, however_ , that no such
investment or loss thereon will affect the amounts payable or the timing of
the amounts payable to the holders of Public Common Units pursuant to the
other provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments will be paid promptly to Parent.

Section 3.4 _Election Procedures_. Each holder of record of a Public
Common Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Election Deadline
(a " _Partnership Holder_ ") shall have the right, subject to the limitations
set forth in this _Article III_ , to submit an Election on or prior to the
Election Deadline in accordance with the following procedures:

(a) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the Partnership
(the " _Form of Election_ "), which shall be mailed or caused to be mailed or
delivered by Parent to record holders of Public Common Units so as to permit
the Partnership Holders to exercise their right to make an Election prior to
the Election Deadline.

(b) Each Partnership Holder may specify on the Form of Election in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ and the
instructions on such form (an " _Election_ "), (i) the number of Public Common
Units with respect to which such Partnership Holder desires to make a Share
Election, (ii) the number of Public Common Units with respect to which such
Partnership Holder desires to make a Mixed Election and (iii) the number of
Public Common Units with respect to which such Partnership Holder desires to
make a Cash Election.

(c) Not less than 20 Business Days prior to the anticipated Election
Deadline (the " _Mailing Date_ "), Parent shall mail or cause to be mailed or
delivered, as applicable, the Form of Election to record holders of Public
Common Units as of a record date that is five Business Days prior to the
Mailing Date or such other date as mutually agreed to by Parent and the
Partnership. Parent shall make available one or more Forms of Election as may
reasonably be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders of
record of Public Common Units during the period following the record date for
the Partnership Unitholder Meeting and prior to the Election Deadline, and the
Partnership shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably
necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform as specified herein. 

(d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent
shall have received, prior to the Election Deadline, a Form of Election
properly completed and signed and accompanied by Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu of the Certificates), if any, for the Public Common Units to
which such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in
form acceptable for transfer on the books of the Partnership or by an
appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such Certificates as set forth
in such Form of Election, from a 

 



20

    

 firm that is an eligible guarantor institution (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15
under the Exchange Act); _provided_ , that such Certificates are in
fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee
of delivery, and, in the case of Book-Entry Units, any additional documents
specified in the procedures set forth in the Form of Election. Failure to
deliver Public Common Units covered by such a guarantee of delivery within
the time set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any
otherwise properly made Election, unless otherwise determined by Parent, in
its sole and absolute discretion. As used herein, unless otherwise jointly
agreed in advance by the Partnership and Parent, " _Election Deadline_ " means
5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal office of the
Exchange Agent is located) on a date mutually agreed by the Partnership and
Parent but which in no event shall be less than one Business Day prior to the
anticipated Closing Date. Parent and the Partnership shall issue a joint press
release reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the
anticipated date of the Election Deadline not more than 15 Business Days
before, and at least five Business Days prior to, the anticipated date of the
Election Deadline. Without limiting the other provisions set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 3.4_, any Public Common Units with respect to which the
Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly completed Form of
Election prior to the Election Deadline shall also be deemed to be Non-
Election Units.

(e) Any Partnership Holder may, at any time prior to the Election
Deadline, change or revoke such Partnership Holders Election by written
notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline
accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised Form of Election or by
written withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of such Partnership
Holders Certificates or of the guarantee of delivery of such Certificates or
any documents in respect of Book-Entry Units, previously deposited with the
Exchange Agent. In the event an Election is revoked prior to the Election
Deadline, the Public Common Units represented by such Election shall be deemed
to have made no Election, except to the extent a subsequent Election is
properly made prior to the Election Deadline. After an Election is validly
made with respect to any Public Common Units, any subsequent transfer of such
Public Common Units shall automatically revoke such Election. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Elections shall
be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of written
notification from the Partnership that this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with _Article VIII_. The Exchange Agent shall have reasonable
discretion to determine if any Election is not properly made with respect to
any Public Common Units (none of the parties or the Exchange Agent being under
any duty to notify any Partnership Holder of any such defect). In the event
the Exchange Agent makes such a determination, such Election shall be deemed
to be not in effect, and the Public Common Units covered by such Election
shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Election Units unless a proper
Election is thereafter timely made with respect to such Public Common Units.

(f) Parent, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the
right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement, governing the manner and extent to which Elections are to be taken
into account in making the determinations prescribed by  _Section_ __ _
3.6_.

Section 3.5 _No Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal
rights shall be available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 3.6 _Proration_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the
aggregate number of Public Common Units to be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)_ (the "
_Cash Conversion Number_ ") shall be equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (i) the Cash Component minus the product obtained by multiplying (A)
the number of Mixed Election Units by (B) $7.63, by (ii) the Cash
Consideration. The " _Cash Component_ " shall be equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (i) the number of Public Common Units issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) $7.63. All other Public Common
Units (other than Mixed Election Units, which shall be converted into the
Mixed Consideration) shall be converted into the right to receive the Share
Consideration, subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.6(b)(ii)_.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation of Merger Consideration
among the holders of Public Common Units as follows:

 

(i) if the sum of the aggregate number of Cash Election Units (such sum,
the " _Total Cash Election Number_ ") exceeds the Cash Conversion Number,
then (A) all Share Election Units and all Non-Election Units shall be
converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration, (B) all Mixed
Election Units shall be converted into the right to receive the Mixed
Consideration and (C) Cash Election Units of each holder thereof shall be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of
that number of Cash Election Units equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Units held by such holder by (y) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Conversion Number and the
denominator of which is the Total Cash Election Number (with the Exchange
Agent to determine, consistent with _Section_ __ _ 3.3_, whether fractions of
Cash Election Units shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of
such holders Cash Election Units being converted into the right to receive
the Share Consideration;

(ii) if the Total Cash Election Number equals the Cash Conversion Number,
then (A) all Cash Election Units shall be converted into the right to receive
the Cash Consideration, (B) all Mixed Election Units shall be converted into
the right to receive the Mixed Consideration, and (C) all Share Election
Units and all Non-Election Units shall be converted into the right to receive
the Share Consideration; and

 

(iii) if the Total Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion
Number (the amount by which the Cash Conversion Number exceeds the Total Cash
Election Number being referred to herein as the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then
(A) all Cash Election Units shall be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration, (B) all Mixed Election Units shall be converted into the
right to receive the Mixed Consideration and (C) the Share Election Units and
the Non-Election Units shall be treated in the following manner: 

(1) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the aggregate number
of all Non-Election Units (the " _Aggregate Non-Election Number_"), then all
Share Election

 



22

    

 Units shall be converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration,
and the Non-Election Units of each holder thereof shall be converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Non-
Election Units equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of
Non-Election Units held by such holder by (B) a fraction, the numerator of
which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the Aggregate
Non-Election Number __ (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with
_Section_ __ _ 3.3_, whether fractions of Non-Election Units shall be rounded
up or down), with the remaining number of such holders Non-Election Units
being converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration; or

 

(2) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the Aggregate Non-Election Number,
then all Non-Election Units shall be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration, and the Share Election Units of each holder thereof shall
be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of
that number of Share Election Units equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the number of Share Election Units held by such holder by (B)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which (x) the Shortfall
Number exceeds (y) the Aggregate Non-Election Number, and the denominator of
which is the total number of Share Election Units (with the Exchange Agent to
determine, consistent with this _Section_ __ _ 3.6_, whether fractions of
Share Election Units shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number
of such holders Share Election Units being converted into the right to
receive the Share Consideration.

Section 3.7 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. Notwithstanding any provision of
this _Article III_ to the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time the number of outstanding Common Units or Parent Shares
shall have been changed between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
into a different number of shares or units or a different class or series
after the date hereof by reason of any subdivisions, reclassifications,
splits, share distributions, combinations or exchanges of Common Units or
Parent Shares, then the Merger Consideration will be correspondingly adjusted
to provide to the holders of Public Common Units the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ _,_ _however_ ,
that nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 3.7_ shall be deemed to permit or
authorize any party hereto to affect any such change that it is not otherwise
authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 3.8 _Treatment of_ _Partnership LTIP Awards_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the General Partner and the Partnership shall take all action
as may be necessary or required in accordance with applicable Law and each
Partnership Long-Term Incentive Plan (including the award agreements in
respect of awards granted thereunder) to give effect to this _Section_ __ _
3.8_ as follows:

(a) _Partnership Performance Units other than Partnership TUR Units_.
Each award of Partnership Performance Units, other than Partnership TUR Units
(as defined below), that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically, without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into a number of
cash-settled performance-based restricted stock units relating to Parent
Shares determined by multiplying the target number of Partnership Performance
Units subject to such award by the number of Parent Shares as comprises the
Share Consideration (after such

 



23

    

 conversion, the " _Converted Gain/Loss PSUs_ "); provided that such
Converted Gain/Loss PSUs shall remain subject to the same terms, conditions
and restrictions (including the same performance vesting requirements) as
applied to the corresponding Partnership Performance Units as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except for such terms rendered inoperative by
reason of the Merger (it being understood and agreed by the parties hereto
that the performance vesting requirements of such awards are not rendered
inoperative by reason of the Merger), and subject to such adjustments as are
reasonably determined by the Parent Board or a committee thereof to be
necessary or appropriate to give effect to the conversion described in this
_Section_ __ _ 3.8(a)_.

 

(b) _Partnership TUR Units_. Each award of Partnership Performance Units
or portion thereof that was eligible to be earned based on the Partnerships
total unitholder return over a designated performance period subject to any
applicable modifier (the " _Partnership TUR Units_ "), that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time,
automatically, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted into a number of cash-settled restricted stock units
relating to Parent Shares determined by multiplying (i) the target number of
Partnership TUR Units subject to such award, times (ii) the number of Parent
Shares as comprises the Share Consideration, times (iii) the TUR Performance
Multiplier (after such conversion, the " _Converted TUR PSUs_ "). The
Converted TUR PSUs shall remain subject to the same terms, conditions and
restrictions as applied to the corresponding Partnership TUR Units as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except (i) for such terms
rendered inoperative by reason of the Merger, and (ii) that such Converted
TUR PSUs shall vest solely based on the holders continued employment or
service with the Parent and its Affiliates through the end of the original
performance period as applied to the corresponding Partnership TUR Units and
shall not be subject to performance vesting requirements. For purposes of the
foregoing, the " _TUR Performance Multiplier_ " shall be equal to the greater
of 100% or such percentage as is determined in accordance with the terms of
the applicable award agreement governing the applicable Partnership TUR Units,
but based on a shortened performance period that ends on the last trading day
prior to the Closing Date. The Converted TUR PSUs shall also be subject to
such adjustments as are reasonably determined by the Parent Board or a
committee thereof to be necessary or appropriate to give effect to the
conversion described in this  _Section_ __ _ 3.8(b)_.

(c) _Partnership Restricted Units_. Each award of Partnership Restricted
Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, automatically, without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and converted into a number of cash-settled restricted
stock units relating to Parent Shares determined by multiplying the number of
Partnership Restricted Units subject to such award by the number of Parent
Shares as comprises the Share Consideration (after such conversion, the "
_Converted Restricted Stock_ "); provided that, such Converted Restricted
Stock shall remain subject to the same vesting and other terms, conditions and
restrictions as applied to the corresponding Partnership Restricted Units as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for such terms rendered
inoperative by reason of the Merger, and subject to such adjustments as are
reasonably determined by the Parent Board or a committee thereof to be
necessary or appropriate to give effect to the conversion described in this
_Section_ __ _ 3.8(c)_.

(d) _Partnership Phantom Units_. Each award of Partnership Phantom Units
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective
Time, automatically, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted into a number of 

 



24

    

 cash-settled restricted stock units relating to Parent Shares determined by
multiplying the number of Partnership Phantom Units subject to such award by
the number of Parent Shares as comprises the Share Consideration (after such
conversion, the " _Converted Phantom RSUs_ " and, together with the Converted
Gain/Loss PSUs, Converted TUR PSUs and Converted Restricted Stock, the "
_Converted LTIP Awards_ "); provided that such Converted Phantom RSUs shall
remain subject to the same terms, conditions and restrictions as applied to
the corresponding Partnership Phantom Units as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except for such terms rendered inoperative by reason of the
Merger, and subject to such adjustments as are reasonably determined by the
Parent Board or a committee thereof to be necessary or appropriate to give
effect to the conversion described in this  _Section_ __ _ 3.8(d)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, all payments with respect to Partnership Phantom Units for
which a deferral election has been made under the terms of the applicable
award agreement shall be made in accordance with the terms of the applicable
deferral election.

(e) _Distribution Equivalent Rights_. All amounts accrued with respect to
distribution equivalent rights relating to a Partnership LTIP Award as of the
Effective Time shall carry over to the corresponding Converted LTIP Award and
shall be paid or forfeited on the same terms, conditions and restrictions
as apply under the agreements governing the Partnership LTIP Award after
giving effect to the conversions described in this _Section_ __ _ 3.8_. All
Converted LTIP Awards shall include dividend equivalent rights, if any, to the
same extent as distribution equivalent rights applied with respect to the
corresponding Partnership LTIP Award, provided that from and after the
Effective Time, such dividend equivalent rights shall be based on dividends of
Parent and subject to such adjustments as are reasonably determined by the
Parent Board or a committee thereof to be necessary or appropriate to give
effect to the conversion described herein.

 

(f) _Assumption of Partnership Long-Term Incentive Plans_. As of the
Effective Time, Parent shall assume the obligations of the General Partner
and the Partnership under the Partnership Long-Term Incentive Plans and such
plans shall be deemed amended to conform to all of the terms and form of the
UGI Corporation 2013 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (as amended, the "
_Parent Plan_ ") and shall be combined with the Parent Plan; provided,
however, that (i) the number of Common Units remaining available for grant and
delivery pursuant to the Partnership Long-Term Incentive Plans as of the
Effective Time (including unissued Common Units subject to outstanding
Partnership LTIP Awards that are cancelled pursuant to this Section 3.8) shall
be adjusted and converted into a number of Parent Shares to become available
for grant and delivery pursuant to the Parent Plan following the Effective
Time based on the conversion ratio implied by the Share Consideration as
determined by the Parent Board or a committee thereof (the " _Assumed Share
Reserve_ "), (ii) notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of Parent Shares
as comprises the Assumed Share Reserve shall not, when combined with the other
Parent Shares issued or to become issued in connection with the Merger or any
related transactions, exceed 19.99% of the number of Parent Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) from and after
the Effective Time, awards from the Assumed Share Reserve may be granted only
to those individuals who were eligible to receive awards under the
Partnership Long-Term Incentive Plans immediately before the Effective Time
(but including any individuals hired after the Effective Time by Parent or its
Subsidiaries).

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARTNERSHIP AND THE GENERAL PARTNER_

 

Except as disclosed in (a) the Partnership SEC Documents filed or publicly
furnished with the SEC on or after October 1, 2016 and prior to the date of
this Agreement (but excluding any disclosure contained in any such Partnership
SEC Documents under the heading "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking
Information" or similar heading (other than any factual information contained
within such headings, disclosure or statements)) or (b) the disclosure letter
delivered by the Partnership to Parent (the " _Partnership Disclosure
Schedule_ ") prior to the execution of this Agreement ( _provided_ , that (i)
disclosure in any section of such Partnership Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other section of this Agreement to
the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that
it is applicable to such other section notwithstanding the omission of a
reference or cross reference thereto and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in
such Partnership Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation
or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a
material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item
has had, would have or would reasonably be expected to have a Partnership
Material Adverse Effect), each of the Partnership and the General Partner,
jointly and severally, represent and warrant to Parent as follows:

 

Section 4.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

 

(a) Each of the Partnership, the General Partner and their respective
Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the applicable Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
incorporated, formed or organized, as applicable, and has all requisite
limited liability company, corporate, partnership or other applicable
entity power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
where the failure to have such power or authority has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Partnership (a " _Partnership Material Adverse Effect_
").

 

(b) Each of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or
qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location
of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so

be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Partnership Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(c) All of the outstanding limited liability company interests, partnership
interests, shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each
material Subsidiary of the Partnership that are owned directly or indirectly
by the Partnership have been duly authorized and validly issued in accordance

effect on the date of this Agreement and on the Closing Date) and are fully

company, to the extent required under the Organizational Documents of such
entity) and nonassessable (to the extent such Subsidiary is a corporate
entity) and are owned free and clear of all liens, pledges, charges,
mortgages,

grant of such Partnership LTIP Award was by its terms to be effective by all
necessary action, including, as applicable, approval by the GP Board (or
a duly authorized committee thereof) and any required member or unitholder

or affected or (iii) result in the exercisability of any right to purchase or
acquire any material asset of the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries,
except, in the case of _clause (ii)_ of this sentence, for such
violations, conflicts, losses, defaults, terminations, cancellations,
accelerations or Liens that have not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Partnership Material Adverse
Effect.

the execution of this Agreement, the Partnership Unitholder Approval is the

Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.5 _Partnership SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities; Internal
Controls_.

 

(a) The Partnership and its Subsidiaries have filed or furnished all
reports, schedules, forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration,
proxy and other statements required to be filed or furnished by them with the
SEC since October 1, 2016 (collectively and together with all documents filed
or publicly furnished on a voluntary basis on Form 8-K, and in each case
including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by
reference therein, the " _Partnership SEC Documents_ "). The Partnership SEC
Documents, as of their respective effective dates (in the case of Partnership
SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the
requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing
dates (in the case of all other Partnership SEC Documents), or, if amended,
as finally amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the
case may be, applicable to such Partnership SEC Documents, and none of the
Partnership SEC Documents as of such respective dates contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



30

    

(b) The consolidated financial statements of the Partnership included in
the Partnership SEC Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of
the date of the last such amendment) comply as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated
in the notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
Partnership and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations, cash flows and changes in partners
capital for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments, none of which has
been or will be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the
Partnership and its consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

(c) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the balance
sheet of the Partnership and its consolidated Subsidiaries (including the
notes thereto) included in the Partnership SEC Documents filed by the
Partnership and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii)
for liabilities and obligations incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (iii) for
liabilities and obligations incurred under or in accordance with this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, neither the Partnership nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued or
contingent), that would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a
consolidated balance sheet of the Partnership prepared in accordance with GAAP
or the notes thereto, other than as have not and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Partnership Material
Adverse Effect.

(d) No Subsidiary of the Partnership is required to file reports, forms or
other documents with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. There are no
outstanding comments from, or unresolved issues raised by, the staff of the
SEC with respect to the Partnership SEC Documents. No enforcement action has
been initiated against the Partnership relating to disclosures contained or
omitted from any Partnership SEC Document.

 

(e) The Partnership makes and keeps books, records, and accounts and has
devised and maintains a system of internal controls, in each case, in all
material respects, as required pursuant to Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange
Act. The Partnership has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act and
the applicable listing standards of the NYSE. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports that it files under
the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to its management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The
General Partners principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to the
Partnerships auditors and the Audit Committee of the GP Board (i) all
significant deficiencies in the designation or operation of internal controls
which could adversely affect the Partnerships ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and have identified for the Partnerships
auditors any material weakness in internal controls and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Partnerships internal controls.

 



31

    

(f) Since October 1, 2016, the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the General Partner have made all certifications (without
qualification or exceptions to the matters certified, except as to knowledge)
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the statements contained in any
such certifications are complete and correct, and none of such entities or
its officers have received notice from any Governmental Authority questioning
or challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or
submission of such certification. As of the date of this Agreement, and
except as disclosed in a Partnership SEC Document filed with the SEC prior to
the date of this Agreement, none of such entities has any knowledge of any
material weaknesses in the design or operation of such internal controls over
financial reporting.

Section 4.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since the Balance
Sheet Date, there has not occurred any change, effect, event or occurrence
that, individually or in the aggregate, has resulted, or would reasonably be
likely to result, in a Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.7 _Legal Proceedings_. There are no Proceedings pending or, to
the knowledge of the Partnership, threatened in writing with respect to the
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries or Proceedings pending or, to the
knowledge of the Partnership, threatened in writing with respect to any of
their respective properties or assets at law or in equity before any
Governmental Authority, and there are no orders, judgments, decrees or similar
rulings of any Governmental Authority against the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case except for those that have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.8 _Compliance_ _With_ _Laws; Permits_.

 

(a) The Partnership and its Subsidiaries are, and since the later of
September 30, 2016 and their respective dates of incorporation, formation or
organization have been, in compliance with and are not in default under or in
violation of any applicable federal, state, local or foreign or provincial
law, statute, tariff, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order,
injunction, stipulation, determination, award or decree or agency requirement
of or undertaking to any Governmental Authority, including common law
(collectively, " _Laws_ " and each, a " _Law_ "), except where such non-
compliance, default or violation has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Partnership Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The Partnership and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all
franchises, tariffs, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements,
variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any
Governmental Authority (" _Permits_ "), necessary for the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and assets or to
carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted (collectively, the "
_Partnership Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any of the
Partnership Permits has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Partnership Material Adverse Effect. All
Partnership Permits are in full force and effect, except where the failure to
be in full force and effect has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,

 



32

    

 a Partnership Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any
of the Partnership Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of the Partnership,
threatened in writing, except where such suspension or cancellation has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Partnership Material Adverse Effect. The Partnership and its
Subsidiaries are not, and since September 30, 2016 have not been, in
violation or breach of, or default under, any Partnership Permit, except where
such violation, breach or default has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Partnership Material
Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, no event or condition has
occurred or exists which would result in a violation of, breach, default or
loss of a benefit under, or acceleration of an obligation of Partnership or
any of its Subsidiaries under, any Partnership Permit, or has caused (or
would cause) an applicable Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to issue,
renew or extend, any Partnership Permit (in each case, with or without notice
or lapse of time or both), except for violations, breaches, defaults, losses,
accelerations or failures that have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Partnership Material
Adverse Effect. The Partnership Permits will not be subject to suspension,
modification, revocation or non-renewal as a result of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except, in each case, as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect. No Proceeding is
pending or, to the knowledge of the Partnership, threatened with respect to
any alleged failure by the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries to have
any material Permit necessary for the operation of any asset or the conduct
of their businesses or to be in compliance therewith, except, in each case, as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Partnership Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 4.8(a)_, none of the
Partnership, its Subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of the Partnership, any
consultant, agent or representative of any of the foregoing (in their
respective capacities as such), (i) has violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, and any other U.S. and foreign anti-corruption Laws that are
applicable to the Partnership or its Subsidiaries; (ii) has, to the knowledge
of the Partnership, been given written notice by any Governmental Authority of

representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 5.9_, none of the information supplied (or to be supplied) in
writing by or on behalf of the Partnership and the General Partner

registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC by Parent in
connection with the issuance of Parent Shares in connection with the Merger

") will, at the time the Registration Statement, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, is filed with the SEC or at the time it becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, (b) the Proxy Statement will, on
the date it is first mailed to Limited Partners and at the time of
the Partnership Unitholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading or 

 



33

    

 (c) the Schedule 13E-3 will, at the time the Schedule 13E-3, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be

or permit termination, modification or acceleration, under any such
Partnership Material Contract and (iv) as of the date of this Agreement no
other party to any Partnership Material Contract is in default thereunder,
nor does any condition exist that with notice or lapse of time or both would
constitute a default by any such other party thereunder, or permit
termination, modification or acceleration under any Partnership Material
Contract other than in accordance with its terms nor has any other party
repudiated any provision of any Partnership Material Contract.

or opinion letter as to such qualification from the Internal Revenue Service,

reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that it is applicable to
such other section notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross

Merger Sub and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of this

 



40

    

 Agreement by the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of them

_Takeover Laws_ ") do not, and will not, apply to this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated this Agreement, including the
Merger and the Parent Stock Issuance.

 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent,
Holdings and Merger Sub, nor the consummation by Parent, Holdings and Merger
Sub of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, nor compliance by
Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub with any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement, will (i) contravene, conflict with, violate any provision of,
result in any breach of, or require the consent of any Person under, the
terms, conditions or provisions of the Organizational Documents of Parent,
Holdings or Merger Sub or any of Parents material Subsidiaries, (ii)

default) under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or
cancellation under, give rise to a right to receive a change of
control payment (or similar payment) under, accelerate the performance
required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective
properties or assets of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract or Parent Permit to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound or affected or (iii) result in
the exercisability of any right to purchase or acquire any material asset of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of _clause (ii)_ of

cancellations, accelerations or Liens that have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

NYSE, no consents or approvals of, or filings, declarations or registrations
with, any Governmental Authority are necessary for the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, other than such other consents, approvals, filings, declarations
or registrations that are not required to be obtained or made prior to the
consummation of such transactions or, if not obtained, made or given, would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.5 _Parent SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities; Internal
Controls_. 

(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries have filed or furnished all reports,
schedules, forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and
other statements required to be filed or furnished by them with the SEC since
October 1, 2016 (collectively and together with all documents filed or
publicly furnished on a voluntary basis on Form 8-K, and in each case
including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by
reference therein, the " _Parent SEC Documents_ "). The Parent SEC Documents,
as of their respective effective dates (in the case of the Parent SEC
Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements
of the Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing dates (in the
case of all other Parent SEC Documents), or, if amended, as finally amended
prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, as the case may be, applicable to such Parent SEC Documents, and
none of the Parent SEC Documents as of such respective dates contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

(b) The consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent
SEC Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the
last such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the
notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders equity for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, to
normal year-end audit adjustments, none of which has been or will
be, individually or in the aggregate, material to Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

 

(c) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the balance
sheet of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries (including the notes
thereto) included in the Parent SEC Documents filed by Parent and publicly
available prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) for liabilities and
obligations incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and (iii) for liabilities and
obligations incurred under or in accordance with this Agreement or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature (whether

 



42

    

 or not accrued or contingent), that would be required to be reflected or
reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent prepared in
accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, other than as have not and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(d) No Subsidiary of Parent is required to file reports, forms or other
documents with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. There are no outstanding
comments from, or unresolved issues raised by, the staff of the SEC with
respect to the Parent SEC Documents. No enforcement action has been initiated
against Parent relating to disclosures contained or omitted from any Parent
SEC Document.

(e) Parent makes and keeps books, records, and accounts and has devised and
maintains a system of internal controls, in each case, in all material
respects, as required pursuant to Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act. Parent
has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e)
and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by
Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act and the applicable listing standards of
the NYSE. Such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to
ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by Parent in the
reports that it files under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and
communicated to its management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Parents principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent
evaluation, to Parents auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board
(A) all significant deficiencies in the designation or operation of internal
controls which could adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and have identified for Parents auditors
any material weakness in internal controls and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Parents internal controls.

 

(f) Since October 1, 2016, the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of Parent have made all certifications (without
qualification or exceptions to the matters certified, except as to knowledge)
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the statements contained in any such
certifications are complete and correct, and none of such entities or its
officers have received notice from any Governmental Authority questioning or
challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or submission
of such certification. As of the date of this Agreement, and except as
disclosed in a Parent SEC Document filed with the SEC prior to the date of
this Agreement, none of such entities has any knowledge of any material
weaknesses in the design or operation of such internal controls over financial
reporting.

 

Section 5.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since the Balance
Sheet Date, there has not occurred any change, effect, event or occurrence
that, individually or in the aggregate, has resulted, or would reasonably be
likely to result, in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.7 _Legal Proceedings_. There are no Proceedings pending or, to
the knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing with respect to Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or Proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened in writing with respect to any of their respective properties or
assets at law or in equity before any Governmental Authority, and there are
no orders,

 



43

    

 judgments, decrees or similar rulings of any Governmental Authority against
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case except for those that have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.8 _Compliance _ _With_ _Laws; Permits_.

(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries are, and since the later of September 30,
2015 and their respective dates of incorporation, formation or organization,
have been, in compliance with and are not in default under or in violation of
any applicable Law, except where such non-compliance, default or violation
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Parent and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all Permits necessary
for Parent and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties
and assets or to carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted
(collectively, the " _Parent Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any
of the Parent Permits has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All
Parent Permits are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in
full force and effect has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No
suspension or cancellation of any of the Parent Permits is pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing, except where such suspension
or cancellation has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and
its Subsidiaries are not, and since September 30, 2016 have not been, in
violation or breach of, or default under, any Parent Permit, except where
such violation, breach or default has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, no event or condition has occurred
or exists which would result in a violation of, breach, default or loss of a
benefit under, or acceleration of an obligation of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any Parent Permit, or has caused (or would cause) an
applicable Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to issue, renew or extend,
any Parent Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time or
both), except for violations, breaches, defaults, losses, accelerations or
failures that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The Parent
Permits will not be subject to suspension, modification, revocation or non-
renewal as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except, in each case, as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. No Proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
with respect to any alleged failure by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
have any material Permit necessary for the operation of any asset or
the conduct of their businesses or to be in compliance therewith, except, in
each case, as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 5.8(a)_, none of
Parent, its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any consultant,
agent or representative of any of the foregoing (in their respective
capacities as such), (i) has violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,
and any other U.S. and foreign anti-corruption Laws that are applicable to
Parent or its Subsidiaries; (ii) has, to the knowledge of Parent, been given
written notice by any Governmental Authority of any facts which, if true,
would constitute a violation of the U.S. 

 



44

    

 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other U.S. or foreign anti-corruption
Laws by any such Person; and (iii) to the knowledge of Parent, is being (and
has not been) investigated by any Governmental Authority except, in each case
of the foregoing _clauses (i)_ through _(iii)_ , as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

representations and warranties of the Partnership and the General Partner,
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.9_, none of the information supplied (or to be
supplied) in writing by or on behalf of Parent specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (a) the Registration Statement will, at the
time the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, is
filed with the SEC or at the time it becomes effective under the Securities
Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, (b) the Proxy Statement will, on the date
it is first mailed to Limited Partners and at the time of the Partnership
Unitholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading
or (c) the Schedule 13E-3 will, at the time the Schedule 13E-3, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy

that to the extent any such action was taken solely by Representatives of
Parent or by the Partnership at the explicit direction of Representatives of
Parent, it will not be deemed a " _Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change_
").

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
Partnership Unitholder Approval, (i) the Partnership has received an
unsolicited written Alternative Proposal that the Audit Committee believes is
bona fide, (ii) the Audit Committee, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that (A) such
Alternative Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to or
result in a Superior Proposal and (B) failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law, as modified by the
Partnership Agreement, and (iii) such Alternative Proposal did not result from
a material breach of  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_, then the Partnership may,
subject to _clauses (x)_ and _(y)_ below, (A) furnish information, including
confidential information, with respect to the Partnership and its Subsidiaries
to the Person making such Alternative Proposal and (B) participate in
discussions or negotiations regarding such Alternative Proposal; _ provided_,
__ that (x) the Partnership will not, and will use reasonable best efforts
to cause its Representatives not to, disclose any non-public information to
such Person unless the Partnership has, or first enters into, an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with such Person and (y) the Partnership will
provide to Parent non-public information about the Partnership or its
Subsidiaries that was not previously provided or made available to Parent
prior to or substantially concurrently with providing or making available
such non-public information to such other Person.

 

(c) In addition to the other obligations of the Partnership set forth in
this _Section 6.3_ , the Partnership shall promptly advise Parent, orally and
in writing, and in no event later than 48 hours after receipt, if any
proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact is received by, any information is
requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated
or continued with, the Partnership in respect of any Alternative Proposal, and
shall, in any such notice to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person
making such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact and the terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers or the nature of any inquiries or
contacts (and shall include with such notice copies of any written materials
received from or on behalf of such Person relating to such proposal, offer,
inquiry or request), and thereafter shall promptly keep Parent reasonably
informed of all material developments affecting the status and terms of any
such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests (and the Partnership shall
promptly provide Parent with copies of any additional material written
materials received by the Partnership or that the Partnership has delivered to
any third party making an Alternative Proposal that relate to such proposals,
offers, inquiries or requests) and of the status of any such discussions
or negotiations.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval, the Audit Committee
may effect a Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an
Alternative Proposal or an Intervening Event if the Audit Committee, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law, as modified by the
Partnership Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the Audit Committee may not
effect a Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to the foregoing
unless:

(i) if the Audit Committee intends to effect such Partnership Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Alternative Proposal:



     | (1) |

such Alternative Proposal is bona fide, in writing and has not been withdrawn
or abandoned;  

---|---|--- 
 



55

         | (2) |

the Audit Committee has determined, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments offered by
Parent pursuant to _clause (5)_ below; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (3) |

the Audit Committee or Partnership has provided prior written notice to Parent
in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 9.10_ (the " _Superior Proposal Notice_
") of the Audit Committees intention to effect a Partnership Adverse
Recommendation Change, and such Superior Proposal Notice has specified the
identity of the Person making such Alternative Proposal, the material terms
and conditions of such Alternative Proposal, and complete copies of any
written proposal or offers (including proposed agreements) received by the
Partnership in connection with such Alternative Proposal; 

---|---|--- 



     | (4) |

during the period that commences on the date of delivery of the Superior
Proposal Notice as determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.10_ and
ends at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the date that is the fifth calendar day
following the date of such delivery (the " _Superior Proposal Notice Period_
"), the Audit Committee shall (A) negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the
extent Parent seeks to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would permit the Audit Committee not to effect
a Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change; and (B) keep Parent reasonably
informed with respect to the status and changes in the material terms and
conditions of such Alternative Proposal or other change in circumstances
related thereto; _ provided,_ __ _ however_, that any material revisions to
such Alternative Proposal (it being agreed that any change in the purchase
price in such Alternative Proposal shall be deemed a material revision)
shall require delivery of a subsequent Superior Proposal Notice and a
subsequent Superior Proposal Notice Period in respect of such revised
Alternative Proposal, except that such subsequent Superior Proposal Notice
Period shall expire upon the later of (x) the end of the initial Superior
Proposal Notice Period and (y) 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the date that is the
third calendar day following the date of the delivery of such subsequent
Superior Proposal Notice; and 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (5) |

the Audit Committee shall have considered all revisions to the terms of this
Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by Parent and, at the end of the
Superior Proposal Notice Period, shall have determined in good faith that (A)
such Alternative Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal even if
such revisions were to be given effect and (B) failure to effect a
Partnership 

---|---|--- 
 



56

         |  Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its
duties under applicable Law, as modified by the Partnership Agreement, even if
such revisions were to be given effect.  
---|--- 

(ii) if the Audit Committee intends to effect such Partnership Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event:



     | (1) |

the Partnership has provided prior written notice to Parent in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 9.10_ (the " _Partnership Recommendation Change Notice_
") of the Audit Committees intention to effect a Partnership Adverse
Recommendation Change, and such Partnership Recommendation Change Notice has
specified the details of such Intervening Event and the reasons for the
Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change; 

---|---|--- 



     | (2) |

during the period that commences on the date of delivery of the Partnership
Recommendation Change Notice as determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _

calendar day following the date of such delivery (the " _Partnership
Recommendation Change Notice Period_ "), the Partnership shall (A) negotiate
with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement as would permit the Audit Committee not to effect a
Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change; and (B) keep Parent reasonably
informed of any change in circumstances related thereto; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (3) |

the Audit Committee shall have considered all revisions to the terms of this
Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by Parent and, at the end of the
Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change Notice Period, shall have determined
in good faith that the failure to effect a Partnership Adverse Recommendation
Change would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law, as
modified by the Partnership Agreement, even if such revisions were to be given
effect. 

---|---|--- 
 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Partnership or
the GP Board from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Alternative Proposal if the GP
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that its failure to do so would be reasonably likely to constitute a
violation of applicable Law; _ provided_, __ that any Partnership Adverse
Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with _Section 6.3(d)_.
For the avoidance of doubt, a public statement that describes the
Partnerships receipt of an Alternative Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed a Partnership Adverse
Recommendation Change.

 



57

    

Section 6.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Parent, on the one hand, and each of the
Partnership and the General Partner, on the other hand, shall cooperate with
the other and use and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use its

actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things, necessary, proper or
advisable to cause the conditions to the Closing to be satisfied as promptly

for the avoidance of doubt, in the case of Parent and the General Partner
until the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, retaining
ownership and voting control over all Common Units beneficially owned by
Parent and the General Partner as of the date of this Agreement or acquired
thereafter and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious

Parent or its Affiliates acquire beneficial or direct ownership of any Common
Units.

Section 6.5 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release
with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press

Thereafter, neither the Partnership nor Parent shall issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement (to the extent
not previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by applicable
Laws or by any applicable listing agreement with the NYSE as determined in the
good faith judgment of the party proposing to make such release (in
which case such party shall not issue or cause the publication of such press
release or other public announcement without prior consultation with the other
party); _provided, however_ , that neither the Partnership nor Parent shall be
required by this  _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ to consult with any other party with
respect to a public announcement in connection with a Partnership Adverse
Recommendation Change but nothing in this proviso shall limit the obligations
of the Partnership, the General Partner, the GP Board, the Audit Committee,
Parent or the Parent Board under _Section_ __ _ 6.3_; _provided, further_ ,
that each party and their respective controlled Affiliates may make statements
that are consistent with statements made in previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made by Parent or the Partnership in
compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_.

 

Section 6.6 _Access to Information_. Upon reasonable advance notice and
subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each
party shall, and shall cause each of its material Subsidiaries to afford to
the other party and its Representatives, reasonable access

 



58

    

 during normal business hours (and, with respect to books and records, the
right to copy) to all of its and its Subsidiaries properties, commitments,
books, Contracts, records and correspondence (in each case, whether in
physical or electronic form), officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other Representatives, in each case for the purpose of
completing diligence related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , that such access shall be provided on a basis that
minimizes the disruption to the operations of the requested party and its
Representatives. Subject to applicable Laws, during such period, Parent shall
furnish promptly to the Partnership (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed, published, announced or
received by it in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal, state
or foreign Laws (including pursuant to the Securities Act, the Exchange Act
and the rules of any Governmental Authority thereunder), as applicable (other
than documents which such party is not permitted to disclose under applicable
Laws) and (ii) all information concerning Parents business, properties and
personnel as the Partnership may reasonably request, including all information
relating to environmental matters, for the purpose of completing the
Partnerships due diligence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall
have an obligation to provide access to any information the disclosure of
which the other party has concluded may jeopardize any privilege available to
such party or any of its Affiliates relating to such information or would be
in violation of a confidentiality obligation binding on such party or any of
its Affiliates.

 

Section 6.7 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Laws, Parent and the Surviving Entity jointly and severally
agree to (i) indemnify and hold harmless against any reasonable costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs,
expenses and obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses, court
costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as
well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in
or participate in, any Proceeding, including any Proceeding relating to a
claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified
Person), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities, penalties
and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other
charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) in
connection with any actual or threatened Proceeding, and, upon receipt by
Parent of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay
such amount if it shall be determined in a final and non-appealable judgment
entered by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Indemnified Person is
not entitled to be indemnified, provide advancement of expenses with respect
to each of the foregoing to, all Indemnified Persons and (ii) honor the
provisions regarding elimination of liability of officers and directors,
indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of
expenses contained in the Organizational Documents of the Partnership and the
General Partner immediately prior to the Effective Time, and ensure that the
Organizational Documents of the Partnership and the General Partner or any of
their respective successors or assigns, if applicable, shall, for a period of
six years following the Effective Time, contain provisions no less favorable
with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of
present and former directors, officers and employees of the Partnership and
the General Partner than are presently set forth in such Organizational
Documents. Any right of an Indemnified Person pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.7(a)_ shall not be amended, repealed, terminated or

 



59

    

 otherwise modified at any time in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights of such Indemnified Person as provided herein, and shall be enforceable
by such Indemnified Person and their respective heirs and representatives
against Parent and the General Partner and their respective successors and
assigns.

 

(b) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Parent shall
maintain in effect Parents current directors and officers liability
insurance policies covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time with respect to Indemnified Persons ( _provided_ , that Parent
may substitute therefor policies with reputable carriers of at least the same
coverage containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the
Indemnified Persons); _provided, however_ , that in no event shall Parent be
required to expend pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.7(b)_ more than an
amount per year equal to 300% of current annual premiums paid by Parent for
such insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_ "). In the event that, but for the
proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, Parent would be required to
expend more than the Maximum Amount, Parent shall obtain the maximum amount of
such insurance as is available for the Maximum Amount. If Parent in its sole
discretion elects, then, in lieu of the obligations of Parent under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.7(b)_, Parent may (but shall be under no obligation to),
prior to the Effective Time, purchase a "tail policy" with respect to acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time
that were committed or alleged to have been committed by such Indemnified
Persons in their capacity as such; _provided_ , that in no event shall the
cost of such policy exceed the Maximum Amount.

 

(c) The rights of any Indemnified Person under this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_
shall be in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may have
under the Organizational Documents of the Partnership and the General Partner,
any indemnification agreements, or the DLLCA and DRULPA. The provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and are expressly intended to benefit each of
the Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and representatives. If
Parent and/or the General Partner, or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of their businesses or assets to
any other Person, then, in each such case, to the extent necessary, a proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and/or
the General Partner shall assume the obligations of Parent and the General
Partner set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_.

 

Section 6.8 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section_
__ _ 8.2_ and  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement including all
legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting and all other fees and
expenses of third parties incurred by a party in connection with the
negotiation and effectuation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be the obligation of
the respective party incurring such fees and expenses, except (a) Parent and
the Partnership shall each bear and pay one half of the expenses incurred in
connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Registration
Statement, the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 and (b) Parent shall pay
all costs and fees of the Exchange Agent and all expenses associated with the
exchange process.

 

Section 6.9 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Partnership shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent
permitted under applicable Laws) to

 



60

    

 cause any dispositions of Common Units (including derivative securities with
respect to Common Units) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to the Partnership, or will become subject to such reporting
requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.10 _Listing_. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement to be approved for listing (subject, if applicable, to notice of

Section 6.11 _Dividends and Distributions_.

 

(a) After the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 6.11(b)_, each of Parent and the Partnership shall coordinate
with the other regarding the timing of any declaration of any dividends or
distributions in respect of Parent Common Stock and Partnership Interests and
the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention
of the parties that holders of Partnership Interests shall not receive, for
any quarter, distributions both in respect of Partnership Interests and also
dividends in respect of Parent Common Stock that they receive in exchange
therefor in the Merger, but that they shall receive for any such quarter
either: (i) only distributions in respect of Partnership Interests or (ii)
only dividends in respect of Parent Common Stock that they receive in
exchange therefor in the Merger.

(b) After the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, the
General Partner shall (and the Parent shall, directly or indirectly, cause
its Representatives on the GP Board to), determine, declare, and cause the
Partnership to pay regular quarterly cash distributions on the Common Units
for each quarter in accordance with the Partnership Agreement and in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, including with
respect to the timing of record dates and payment dates; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that subject to Section 18-607 of the DRULPA and the Partnership
Agreement, any such regular quarterly distribution shall not be less than
$0.95 per Common Unit. The General Partner shall (and the Parent shall,
directly or indirectly, cause its Representatives on the GP Board to)
designate the record date for the quarterly cash distribution related to the
quarter immediately prior to the quarter in which the Closing occurs so that
such record date precedes the Effective Time so as to permit the payment of
such quarterly distribution to the holders of the Common Units.

 

Section 6.12 _Audit Committee_. Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time
and the termination of this Agreement, Parent shall not and it shall not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, and it shall not and shall not permit any
of its Subsidiaries to take any action intended to cause the General Partner
to, without the consent of a majority of the then existing members of the
Audit Committee, eliminate the Audit Committee, revoke or diminish the
authority of the Audit Committee or remove or cause the removal of any
director of the General Partner that is a member of the Audit Committee either
as a director or as a member of such committee. For the avoidance of doubt,
this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ shall not apply to the filling, in accordance with
the provisions of the General Partner Bylaws, of any vacancies caused by
the resignation, death or incapacity of any such director.

 



61

    

Section 6.13 _Performance by the General Partner_. Parent will cause the
General Partner, the Partnership and their respective Subsidiaries to comply
with the provisions of this Agreement and, with respect to the General
Partner, the Support Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is
understood and agreed that actions or inactions by the Partnership and the
General Partner and their respective Subsidiaries shall not be deemed to be
breaches or violations or failures to perform by Parent of any of the
provisions of this Agreement unless such action or inaction was or was not
taken, in either case, at the direction of Parent. In no event shall the
General Partner or the Partnership have any liability for, or be deemed to
breach, violate or fail to perform any of the provisions of this Agreement by
reason of, any action taken or omitted to be taken by the General Partner, the
Partnership, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives at the direction of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Representatives.

Section 6.14 _Cooperation with Debt and Equity Financing_. From and after
the date of this Agreement, the Partnership shall, and the Partnership shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries and use reasonable best efforts to cause its
and their representatives (including their auditors) to, use its respective
reasonable best efforts to provide all customary cooperation (including
providing reasonably available financial and other information regarding the
Partnership and its Subsidiaries for use in marketing and offering documents
and to enable Parent to prepare pro forma financial statements) as reasonably
requested by Parent to assist Parent in the arrangement of any bank debt
financing or any capital markets debt or equity financing, any repayment,
restructuring or refinancing of debt contemplated by this Agreement or
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation
of the Merger; it being understood that the arrangement of any bank
debt financing or any capital markets debt financing or the repayment,
restructuring or refinancing of any debt shall not be a condition to Parents
or Merger Subs obligations to effect the Merger. Parent shall indemnify and
hold harmless the General Partner, the Partnership and their respective
Subsidiaries from and against any and all losses or damages actually suffered
or incurred by them directly in connection with the arrangement of any such
bank debt financing or any capital markets debt financing.

Section 6.15 _Tax Treatment_. For United States federal income tax
purposes (and for purposes of any applicable state, local or foreign Tax that
follows the United States federal income tax treatment), the parties agree to
treat the Merger as a taxable sale of the Public Common Units to Holdings in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. The parties will prepare and file all
Tax Returns consistent with the foregoing and will not take any inconsistent
position on any Tax Return, or during the course of any Proceeding with
respect to Taxes, except as otherwise required by applicable Laws following a
final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
administrative settlement with or final administrative decision by the
relevant Governmental Authority.

 

Section 6.16 _Takeover Statutes_. Parent shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, take any action that would, or would reasonably be
expected to, cause any Takeover Law to become applicable to this Agreement,
the Merger, the Parent Stock Issuance or the other transactions contemplated
hereby or related thereto. If any Takeover Law shall become applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger, the Parent Stock Issuance or the other
transactions contemplated hereby or related thereto, Parent and the Parent
Board shall grant such approvals and shall use 

 



62

    

 reasonable best efforts to take such actions so that the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger and the Parent Stock Issuance, may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby
and otherwise use reasonable best efforts to eliminate or minimize the effects
of such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger and the Parent Stock Issuance.

 

Section 6.17 _Securityholder_ _Litigation_. The Partnership and the
General Partner shall give Parent prompt notice and the opportunity to
participate in the defense or settlement of any securityholder litigation
against the Partnership and the General Partner and/or their directors (as
applicable) relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
no such settlement shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of
Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
_provided_ , that the Partnership and the General Partner shall in any
event control such defense and/or settlement and shall not be required to
provide information if doing so would be reasonably expected to violate the
confidentiality obligations of such party or threaten the loss of any
attorney-client privilege or other applicable legal privilege.

date); (ii) the representations and warranties of Parent contained in
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_ shall be true and correct in all respects, other than
immaterial misstatements or omissions, both when made and at and as of the
Closing Date, as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent
expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date); and
(iii) all other representations and warranties of Parent set forth herein
shall be true and correct both when made and at and as of the Closing Date, as
if made at and as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of an
earlier date, in which case as of such date), except, in the case of this
_clause (iii)_ , where the failure of such representations and warranties to
be so true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to
"materiality" or "Parent Material Adverse Effect" set forth in any individual
representation or warranty, other than in _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ and _Section_
__ _ 5.9_ and the definition of Parent Material Contract in _Section_ __ _
5.11(a)_)

 does not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The Partnership shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by an executive officer of
Parent to such effect.

(b) _Performance of Obligations of the Parent and Merger Sub_. Each of
Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub shall have performed in all material respects
all obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or
prior to the Closing Date. The Partnership shall have received a certificate
signed on behalf of Parent by an executive officer of Parent to such effect.

 

Section 7.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_.

 

(a) None of the Partnership nor the General Partner may rely on the failure
of any condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was
due to the failure of either such party to perform and comply in all material
respects with the covenants and agreements in this Agreement to be performed
or complied with by it prior to the Closing.

 

(b) None of Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any
condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was
due to the failure of any such party to perform and comply in all
material respects with the covenants and agreements in this Agreement to be
performed or complied with by it prior to the Closing.

ARTICLE VIII 

_TERMINATION_

 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement abandoned at any time prior to
the Effective Time:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Partnership and Parent duly
authorized by the Parent Board and the Audit Committee, respectively.

(b) by either of the Partnership or Parent:

(i) if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before November
1, 2019 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided, however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)(_ _i_ _)_ shall not
be available (A) to a party if the inability to satisfy such condition was
due to the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement or (B) to a party if the other party has filed (and is then
pursuing) an action seeking specific performance as permitted by _Section_ __
_ 9.9_;

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section_ __ _
7.1(b)_ shall be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable;
_provided, however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a party if such
Restraint was due to the failure of such party to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement; or

 



65

    

(iii) if the Partnership Unitholder Meeting shall have concluded and the
Partnership Unitholder Approval shall not have been obtained.

(c) by Parent:

 

(i) if a Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred
prior to receipt of the Partnership Unitholder Approval; or

(ii) if the Partnership or the General Partner shall have breached or
failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement (or if any of the representations or
warranties of the Partnership or the General Partner set forth in this
Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (A) would (if it
occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the failure of
a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_
and (B) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by the Partnership or
the General Partner within 30 days following receipt of written notice from
Parent of such breach or failure; _provided, however_ , that Parent shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8.1(c)(ii)_ if Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub is then in material breach of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement.

(d) by the Partnership (which termination may be effected for the
Partnership by the Audit Committee without the consent, authorization or
approval of the GP Board) if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of Parent set
forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (A)
would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ or _Section_
__ _ 7.3(b)_ and (B) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by Parent
within 30 days following receipt of written notice from the Partnership of
such breach or failure; _provided_ , that the Partnership shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_ if
the Partnership or the General Partner is then in material breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement.

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, written notice thereof
shall be given to the other party or parties, specifying the provision of this
Agreement pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement
shall forthwith become null and void (other than the provisions in the last
sentence of _Section_ __ _ 6.6_, the provisions in _Section_ __ _ 6.8_,
this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ and _Article IX_ , all of
which shall survive termination of this Agreement), and, except as otherwise
provided in this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, there shall be no liability on the
part of any of Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub or the Partnership and the General
Partner or their respective directors, officers and Affiliates; _provided,
however_ , that no such termination shall relieve any party hereto from (a)
its obligation to pay the Parent Expense Reimbursement or the Partnership
Termination Fee, as applicable, if, as and when required pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.3_, (b) any liability for any failure to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement when required pursuant
to this Agreement or (c) any liability for intentional fraud or a willful
breach of any covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement. For
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, " _willful breach_ " shall mean a
material breach of this Agreement that is a consequence of a deliberate act or
a deliberate failure 

 



66

    

 to act by the breaching party with the knowledge that the taking of such act
(or the failure to take such act) would (i) cause a material breach of this
Agreement and (ii) prevent or materially delay the Closing. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event shall the General Partner or the Partnership have
any liability for any matter set forth in the proviso of the preceding
sentence for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the General Partner,
the Partnership, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives at the direction of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective Representatives.

 

Section 8.3 _Termination Fees; Expenses_.

 

(a) In the event this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)(_ _i_ _)_ ( _Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change_
), (ii) by the Partnership or Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)(iii)_
( _Failed Partnership Unitholder Vote_ ) in a case where a Partnership
Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred, or (iii) by the Partnership
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)(_ _i_ _)_ ( _Outside Date_ ) and, at the
time of such termination under this  _clause (iii)_ , (A) the Partnership
Unitholder Approval shall not have been obtained and (B) Parent would have
been permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(c)(_ _i_ _)_  ( _Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change_ ), then the
Partnership shall pay to Parent a termination fee equal to $20 million (the "
_Partnership Termination Fee_ ") within two Business Days after the date of
termination. 

(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement by (i) the Partnership or
Parent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)(iii)_ ( _Failed Partnership
Unitholder Vote_ ) (or termination by the Partnership pursuant to a different
provision of _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ at a time when this Agreement was
terminable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)(iii)_ ( _Failed Partnership
Unitholder Vote_ ) other than if the General Partner, the Parent and its
Affiliates, each in their capacity as a Partnership Unitholder, shall have
failed to vote in favor of approval of the Merger at the Partnership
Unitholder Meeting, or (ii) Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)(ii)_ (
_Partnership or General Partner Uncured Breach_ ), then the Partnership shall
promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days after receipt of an
invoice (with supporting documentation) therefor from Parent, pay Parents
designee all of the reasonably documented out-of-pocket expenses (including
all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, financing
sources, hedging counterparties, experts and consultants) incurred by Parent
and its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby up to a maximum amount of $5 million (the " _Parent
Expense Reimbursement_ ").

 

(c) In the event of termination of this Agreement by the Partnership
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_ ( _Parent Uncured Breach_ ), then Parent
shall promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days after receipt of
an invoice (with supporting documentation) therefor from the Partnership, pay
the Partnerships designee all of the reasonably documented out-of-pocket
expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment
bankers, financing sources, hedging counterparties, experts and consultants)
incurred by the Partnership and its Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby up to a maximum amount of
$5 million (the " _Partnership Expense Reimbursement_ ").

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the Partnership
Termination Fee, Parent Expense Reimbursement and Partnership Expense
Reimbursement are not intended to

 



67

    

 be a penalty, but rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate the other party, as applicable, in the circumstances in which
such amounts are due and payable and which do not involve fraud or willful
and material breach, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
forgone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and
on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. In no event shall a party be entitled to more than one payment of
the Partnership Termination Fee, Parent Expense Reimbursement and Partnership
Expense Reimbursement, as applicable, in connection with a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to which such amounts are payable.

 

(e) The parties acknowledge that the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and that,
without these agreements, none of the Partnership, General Partner, Parent,
Holdings or Merger Sub would enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, in the
event that the Partnership shall fail to pay the Partnership Termination Fee
required pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ when due, such fee shall accrue
interest for the period commencing on the date such fee became past due, at a
rate equal to the prime rate set forth in  _The_ __ _ Wall Street Journal_
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus 5%. In
addition, if the Partnership shall fail to pay the Partnership Termination Fee
when due, the Partnership shall also pay all of Parents reasonable costs and
expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with efforts
to collect such fee.

 

ARTICLE IX

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 

Section 9.1 _No Survival, Etc._ The representations, warranties and
agreements in this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
schedule, instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement)
shall terminate at the Effective Time or, except as otherwise provided in
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_ or  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, upon the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, as the case may be, except that
the agreements set forth in _Article I_ , _Article II_ , _Article III,_
the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 6.6_, _Section_ __ _ 6.8_, _Section_ __
_ 6.10_ and _Article IX_ and any other agreement in this Agreement that
contemplates performance after the Effective Time shall survive the Effective
Time.

Section 9.2 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the Partnership Unitholder Approval, by
written agreement of the parties, by action taken or authorized by the Parent
Board and the GP Board; _provided, however_ , that the GP Board may not take
or authorize any such action unless it has been approved by the Audit
Committee; _provided, further_ , that following receipt of the Partnership
Unitholder Approval, there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions
of this Agreement which by applicable Laws or stock exchange rule would
require further approval by the Limited Partners without such approval.

 

Section 9.3 _GP Board Consent_. Unless otherwise expressly set forth in
this Agreement, whenever a determination, decision, approval, consent, waiver
or agreement of the Partnership or the General Partner is required pursuant to
this Agreement (including any determination to exercise or refrain from
exercising any rights under _Article VIII_  or to enforce the terms of this
Agreement

 



68

    

 (including _Section_ __ _ 9.9_)), such determination, decision, approval or
consent must be authorized by the GP Board; _provided, however_ , that the GP
Board may not take or authorize any such action unless it has been approved
in writing by the Audit Committee.

 

Section 9.4 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc._ At any time prior to the
Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto,
(b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
any other party hereto, (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of
the agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive
any of such partys conditions or (d) make or grant any consent under this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the GP Board may not take or authorize
any such action unless it has been approved in writing by the Audit Committee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Partnership, the
General Partner, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

 

Section 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Holdings
(including any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Holdings created after the
date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time), but no
such assignment shall relieve Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not
permitted under this _Section_ __ _ 9.5_ shall be null, void and ineffective.

 

Section 9.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties. Signatures to this Agreement
transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in "portable
document format" (" _.pdf_ ") form, or by any other electronic means intended
to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will
have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the
original signature.

 

Section 9.7 _Entire Understanding; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, the Support Agreement, the Partnership Disclosure Schedule, the
Parent Disclosure Schedule and any certificates delivered by any party
pursuant to this agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement and
understanding, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement and thereof and (b) shall not confer upon any Person other than
the parties hereto any rights (including third-party beneficiary rights or
otherwise) or remedies hereunder, except for, in the case of _clause (b)_ of
this sentence, the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ and _Section_ __ _
9.12_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, _Section_
__ _ 9.8_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.12_ shall be for the benefit of, and
enforceable by, any financing sources or lender providing financing in
connection with the Merger.

 



69

    

Section 9.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to
be performed entirely within that State.

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware
Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto consents to service being made
through the notice procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.10_, irrevocably
submits with regard to any such action or Proceeding for itself and in respect
of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction
of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties
hereto irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or Proceeding with respect to this
Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.8_, (ii) any claim that it or its
property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or from
any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable Laws, any claim that (A) the suit, action or
Proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of
such suit, action or Proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the
subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each party

hereto expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is intended to be
irrevocable under the Law of the State of Delaware and of the United States
of America; _provided, however_ , that each such partys consent to
jurisdiction and service contained in this _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)_ is solely
for the purpose referred to in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)_ and shall not be
deemed to be a general submission to such courts or in the State of Delaware
other than for such purpose.

 

(c) EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 9.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at
law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
and it is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or

 



70

    

 injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 9.9_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery
or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of
the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the
basis that (a) either party has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity (it being understood that nothing in this sentence shall prohibit the
parties hereto from raising other defenses to a claim for specific performance
or other equitable relief under this Agreement). Each party further agrees
that no party shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 9.9_, and each party irrevocably waives
any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any
such bond or similar instrument.

 

Section 9.10 _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder
must be in writing and will be deemed duly given if delivered personally or

this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, all other terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that

manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

financing source, lender, agent, attorney, representative or Affiliate of any

is expressly a party to this Agreement) shall have any liability (whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise) for any obligations or liabilities arising
under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 9.12_
