Working Capital and the Closing Date Cage Cash, shall be final and binding on
the parties and not subject to any appeal. The Stockholders\' Representative
and Parent agree to request that the Accountants resolve all such difference
and disputes within 15 days of submission to the Accountants. Parent and the
Stockholders\' Representative shall each pay (solely, in the case of the
Stockholders\' Representative, by deduction from the Disputed Holdback Amount
prior to the making of any payments to Parent pursuant to SECTION
2.2(C)(III)) the percentage of the amount of the fees and expenses of the
Accountants equal to (A) the aggregate amount of the disputed
matters submitted to the Accountants that are not settled in favor of such
party (as finally determined by the Accountants), divided by (B) the
aggregate amount of all disputed matters submitted to the Accountants. The
Disputed Holdback Amount, less (x) any fees and expenses of the Accountants
and (y) any expenses of the Stockholders\' Representative, in the case of
each of clauses (x) and (y), to be paid from, or reimbursed by deduction
from, the Holdback Amount pursuant to this SECTION 2.2(C)(II)or SECTION
9.10(D) and not previously paid from the Holdback Amount, is referred to as
the "REMAINING HOLDBACK AMOUNT." The date that the Closing Date Schedule,
including the Closing Balance, the Closing Date Working Capital and the
Closing Date Cage Cash, become final and binding on the parties and not
subject to any appeal is referred to as the "FINAL DETERMINATION DATE."  
(iii) Within 10 days following the Final Determination Date pursuant to
SECTION 2.2(C)(II), final adjustments to the Enterprise Price (the "FINAL
ADJUSTMENTS") shall be made and paid as follows (the date the
Final Adjustments are so made and paid, the "FINAL ADJUSTMENT DATE"):   (1)
if (A) the sum of (x) the Closing Date Working  Capital and (y) the Closing
Date Cage Cash is less than (B) the sum of (x)  the Estimated Working Capital
and (y) the Estimated Cage Cash, then a  portion of the Remaining Holdback
Amount equal to such difference shall be  released by the Escrow Agent,
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, and paid to  Parent; , PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that in the event that the amount of the  Remaining Holdback Amount is less
than the amount of such difference (the  amount by which the Remaining
Holdback Amount is less than the amount of  such difference, the "HOLDBACK
SHORTFALL"), then a portion of the  Indemnification Escrow Fund equal to such
Holdback Shortfall (up to the  amount of the Indemnification Escrow Fund),
shall be released by the Escrow  Agent, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, and
paid to Parent; and   (2) if the sum of (x) the Closing Date Working 
Capital and (y) the Closing Date Cage Cash is greater than (B) the sum of 
(x) the Estimated   6    Working Capital and (y) the Estimated Cage Cash,
then Parent shall promptly  pay, or cause to be paid to the Paying Agent, as
agent for the  Stockholders, an amount in cash equal to such difference (such
amount, the  "FINAL BALANCE SHEET ADJUSTMENT") for distribution to the
Stockholders in  accordance with the Escrow Agreement and their Applicable
Percentages.   Upon the instruction of the Stockholders\' Representative in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, any Holdback Amount that remains after
making (A) any payment required to be made to Parent pursuant to SECTION
2.2(C)(III)(1) and (B) any payment of any expenses of the Stockholders\'
Representative to be paid from, or reimbursed by deduction from, the Holdback
Amount in accordance with SECTION 9.10(D) and not previously paid from the
Holdback Amount (such remaining Holdback Amount, the "FINAL HOLDBACK AMOUNT")
shall be promptly released by the Escrow Agent to the Paying Agent for
distribution to the Stockholders in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and
their Applicable Percentages.   (iv) On the later of (x) the Final
Adjustment Date and (y) the 46th day following the Closing, Parent shall pay,
or cause to be paid to the Paying Agent, as agent for the Stockholders, an
amount in cash equal to the amount of any retention bonuses paid by the
Company at Closing to any employees that have been terminated by the
Surviving Corporation within forty-five days following the Closing (such
amount, the "RETENTION BONUS ADJUSTMENT" and, together with the Final Balance
Sheet Adjustment, the "FINAL ADJUSTMENT CONSIDERATION") for distribution to
the Stockholders in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and their Applicable
Percentages.   (v) Nothing in this SECTION 2.2(C) shall preclude any
party from exercising, or shall adversely affect or otherwise limit in any
respect the exercise of, any right or remedy available to it hereunder for
any misrepresentation or breach of warranty hereunder, but none of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company shall have any right to dispute the Closing
Schedule, including Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Date Working Capital
or the Closing Date Cage Cash, or any portion thereof, once it has been
finally determined in accordance with SECTION 2.2(C)(II).   (d) DEPOSIT;
ESCROW. On the date hereof, Parent shall deposit in readily available funds
of Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000) (such amount, including the interest
accrued, and any other income earned, thereon, the "DEPOSIT"), with Chicago
Title Company of Nevada, Inc. (the "ESCROW AGENT"), pursuant to an escrow
agreement dated as of the date hereof, a copy of which is attached hereto as
EXHIBIT C (as it may be amended from time to time, the "ESCROW AGREEMENT"),
executed and delivered by Parent, the Stockholders\' Representative and the
Escrow Agent. At the Closing, (i) the Deposit (less the Holdback Amount)
shall be released by the Escrow Agent to the Paying Agent pursuant to SECTION
2.3(A)(I) and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, and (ii)
the Holdback Amount shall continue to be held by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement until released pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement and SECTION 2.2(C) of this Agreement. Upon
the termination of this Agreement, the Deposit shall be payable pursuant to
SECTION 6.3, and thereafter shall be promptly released by the Escrow Agent to
Parent or the Company, as applicable, pursuant to SECTION 6.3 and the terms
of the Escrow Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms
and provisions of the Escrow Agreement and the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall control, absent
an express written agreement between the parties hereto to the contrary which
acknowledges this SECTION 2.2(D).   (e) INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW FUND.
Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, on the Closing Date, Parent shall
deposit in escrow a portion of the Total Transaction Consideration equal to
Fifteen Million ($15,000,000) (the "INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW AMOUNT"), in
readily available funds   7   (the Indemnification Escrow Amount,
together with the interest accrued and any other income earned thereon, the
"INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW FUND") with the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement. The Indemnification Escrow Fund shall be held and disbursed as
provided in the Escrow Agreement, which shall provide, among other things,
that (i) any fees or expenses payable to the Escrow Agent under the Escrow
Agreement on account of, in connection with or related to the Indemnification
Escrow Fund (the "ESCROW COSTS") shall first be paid out of any income and
interest accrued on the Indemnification Escrow Amount in the Indemnification
Escrow Fund; (ii) the Indemnification Escrow Fund shall be disbursed (A) to
Parent to satisfy any Holdback Shortfall pursuant to SECTION 2.2(C)(III)(1)
and (B) to the Parent Indemnitees to satisfy any indemnification obligation
of the Stockholders under SECTION 7.2, in the case of this clause (B) only,
when the conditions for indemnification set forth in SECTION 7.2 have
been satisfied; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that to the extent that the balance of
the Indemnification Escrow Fund is not sufficient to satisfy any
indemnification obligations of the Stockholders to the Parent Indemnitees
under SECTION 7.2 when the conditions for indemnification set forth in
SECTION 7.2 have been satisfied, then such shortfall shall be satisfied from
any balance remaining in the PMR/RWB Escrow Funds pursuant to, and in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of, the PMR/RWB
Escrow Agreement; (iii) any income or interest on the Indemnification Escrow
Amount (net of any Escrow Costs) shall be distributed to the Stockholders as
provided in the Escrow Agreement (such net amount, the "INDEMNIFICATION
ESCROW NET EARNINGS"); and (iv) as of the one year anniversary of the Closing
Date, any amount of cash remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Fund (other
than any amount of cash required to satisfy the maximum amount of the
aggregate of any claims for indemnification for which written notice has been
given to the Indemnifying Party in accordance with ARTICLE VII and which
as of such one-year anniversary have not been finally determined), including
any income or interest accrued thereon but less any Escrow Costs and less
any amounts then due and payable from the Indemnification Escrow Fund to any
Parent Indemnitee pursuant to SECTION 7.2, shall be distributed by the Escrow
Agent to the Paying Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement (any such
remaining amounts, the "INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW FINAL BALANCE") and, together
with the Indemnification Escrow Net Earnings, the "INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW
SURPLUS"). Parent shall be treated as the owner of the Indemnification Escrow
Fund for all tax purposes.   SECTION 2.3 MERGER FUND; EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES.   (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint
a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to
act as paying agent under this Agreement (the "PAYING AGENT") for the purpose
of exchanging shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration
and, as applicable, the Additional Consideration. At the Effective Time, (i)
the Deposit (less the Holdback Amount) shall be released by the Escrow Agent
and deposited with the Paying Agent, as agent for the Stockholders, subject
to and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, (ii) Parent
shall irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, as
agent for the Stockholders, cash in an aggregate amount equal to the Total
Transaction Consideration minus (1) the Deposit, (2) the Indemnification
Escrow Amount and (3) the Termination Amount (the sum of the immediately
preceding clauses (i) and (ii), together with any Additional Consideration
deposited with or paid to the Paying Agent pursuant to SECTION 2.2(C)(II),
2.2(C)(III) or 2.2(C)(IV), the "MERGER FUND") and (iii) Parent shall pay the
Termination Amount in accordance with the instructions of the Company and
Peter A. Morton. Pending distribution pursuant to SECTION 2.3(B), the Merger
Fund, the Deposit and the Indemnification Escrow Fund shall be held in trust
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and shall not be used except as permitted by
the Escrow Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Surviving Corporation may
direct the Paying Agent to invest the Merger Fund, PROVIDED that such
investments (i) shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States
of America, in commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating from
either Moody\'s Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation,
in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of domestic commercial banks with equity capital exceeding $500,000,000 or in
money market funds and (ii) shall have maturities that   8   will not
prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to SECTION 2.3(B) and that do
not exceed, in any event, 90 days. Each holder of a certificate
or certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock canceled
and extinguished at the Effective Time pursuant to SECTION 2.1 may thereafter
in accordance with the provisions of SECTION 2.3(B), surrender such
certificate or certificates to the Paying Agent, as agent for such
Stockholder, to effect the exchange of such certificate or certificates for
the Per Share Transaction Consideration on such holder\'s behalf for a period
ending twelve months after the Effective Time.   (b) (i) At the Closing,
the Stockholders may surrender the certificate or certificates representing
their shares of Company Common Stock to the Paying Agent (or such other agent
or agents as may be appointed by the Surviving Corporation), as agent for the
Stockholders, for cancellation. Upon surrender of such certificate or
certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent (or such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by the Surviving Corporation), the certificate or
certificates so surrendered shall be cancelled and the Paying Agent shall pay
(A) on the Closing Date (by check or wire transfer as directed by such
Stockholder in writing delivered to the Paying Agent (or such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by the Surviving Corporation)) as soon as
practicable prior to the Closing Date to the Stockholder who surrendered such
certificate or certificates an amount of cash equal to the product of (x) the
Per Share Merger Consideration and (y) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock represented by the certificate or certificates so surrendered and (B)
thereafter, promptly following the release of any Additional Consideration by
the Escrow Agent to the Paying Agent in accordance with SECTION 2.2(C) and
the Escrow Agreement, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the Pro
Rata Portion of any such Additional Consideration (as determined pursuant to
SECTIONS 2.2(C)(II), 2.2(C)(III), 2.2(C)(IV) and 2.2(E) and (y) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock represented by the certificate or certificates
so surrendered.   (ii) With respect to any certificates not so surrendered
at the Closing, the Surviving Corporation, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder
of record of Company Common Stock represented by such certificates, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to such certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of such certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form
and have such other provisions not inconsistent with this Agreement as the
Surviving Corporation may specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of such certificates in exchange for payment of the Per Share
Transaction Consideration. Upon surrender of a certificate or certificates
for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may
be appointed by the Surviving Corporation, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and completed, the holder of such certificate or
certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, for each
share of Company Common Stock, formerly represented by such certificate or
certificates, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the Per Share
Merger Consideration and (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by the certificate or certificates so surrendered and (B)
thereafter, promptly following the release of any Additional Consideration by
the Escrow Agent to the Paying Agent in accordance with SECTION 2.2(C) and
the Escrow Agreement, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the Pro
Rata Portion of any such Additional Consideration (as determined pursuant to
SECTIONS 2.2(C)(II), 2.2(C)(III), 2.2(C)(IV) and 2.2(E) and (y) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock represented by the certificate or certificates
so surrendered, and the certificate or certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled.   (iii) After the Effective Time, until so
surrendered in accordance with SECTION 2.3(B)(I) or 2.3(B)(II), each
certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed, for
all corporate purposes thereafter, to evidence only the right to receive an
amount of cash equal to the product of (x) the Per Share Transaction
Consideration   9   and (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
evidenced by such certificate. No consideration will be paid to, or delivered
on behalf of the holder of any unsurrendered certificate with respect to
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby until the holder
of record of such certificate shall surrender such certificate pursuant
hereto.   (c) If payment is to be made to a Person other than
the registered holder of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
the certificate or certificates surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be
a condition to such payment that the certificate or certificates so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying
Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of such shares of Company Common
Stock or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has
been paid or is not payable.   (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be
no further transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation
of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this
Agreement.   (e) If any cash deposited with the Paying Agent for purposes
of payment in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock remains unclaimed
twelve months after the Effective Time, such cash, together with all interest
and earnings thereon, shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon
demand, and any such holder who has not converted his, her or its shares of
Company Common Stock into the Per Share Transaction Consideration prior to
that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment
of the Per Share Transaction Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable unclaimed property laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
holders of shares of Company Common Stock five years after the Effective Time
(or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.   (f) Following the Final Adjustment Date, the
Surviving Corporation shall have the right to demand that the Paying Agent
return to the Surviving Corporation such portion of the cash deposited with
the Paying Agent pursuant to SECTION 2.3(A) that represents the Per Share
Transaction Consideration in respect of shares of Company Common Stock for
which dissenters\' rights have been perfected in accordance with the NRS.  
(g) No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate for shares of Company
Common Stock.   (h) In the event that any certificate representing shares
of Company Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
Parent\'s receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of that fact
by the Person claiming such certificate representing shares of Company Common
Stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, (i) an amount in
cash equal to the product of (x) the Per Share Merger Consideration and (y)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such certificate,
and (ii) thereafter, promptly following the release of any Additional
Consideration by the Escrow Agent to the   10   Paying Agent in
accordance with SECTION 2.2(C) or 2.2(E) and the Escrow Agreement, an amount
in cash equal to the product of (x) the Pro Rata Portion of any Additional
Consideration (as determined pursuant to SECTIONS 2.2(C)(II), 2.2(C)(III),
2.2(C)(IV) and 2.2(E)) and (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such certificate.   SECTION 2.4 DISSENTERS\' RIGHTS.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by a Stockholder who has properly exercised
his, her or its dissenter\'s rights under the NRS (the "DISSENTING SHARES")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Transaction
Consideration pursuant to SECTION 2.1(A), but, instead, such shares shall be
converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined
to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to
the requirements of the NRS. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect,
or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, his, her or its right to dissent
from the Merger under the NRS, each share of such holder\'s Company Common
Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective
Time, into the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the Per Share
Transaction Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
notice or demands for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common Stock
received by the Company.   ARTICLE III  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

any subsequent Company SEC Report filed prior to the date of this Agreement,
none of the Company SEC Reports contained, when filed, any untrue statement

respects in compliance with its terms (including contribution requirements)
and applicable laws, including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Code, and

letter for such plan, and, except as set forth in SCHEDULE 3.1(O)(III) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, to the Knowledge of the Company, no circumstances
exist and no events have occurred that would be reasonably expected to
adversely affect the qualified status of any such plan or any related
trust.   (iv) Except as set forth in SECTION 3.1(O)(IV) of the Company

"multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of section 413(c) of the Code)

business which together with the Company would be deemed a "single employer"
within the meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA (an "ERISA AFFILIATE") has at any

occurred with respect to the Company in connection with which the Company
could be subject to any material liability with respect to any Employee
Benefit Plan under ERISA or the Code.   (vi) SECTION 3.1(O)(VI) of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth (i) a list of any Employee Benefit Plan
under which the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or any related event would (either alone

Parent and Merger Sub hereby jointly and severally represents and warrants to
the Company as follows:   (a) ORGANIZATION AND STANDING. Parent is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware, and Merger Sub is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Nevada. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite power and
authority to carry on its business as now being conducted, to own or use the
properties and assets that it purports to own or use, and to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and its other material contracts, in each
case, except as would not reasonably be expected to prevent consummation of
the Merger.   (b) AUTHORITY. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by each of Parent and Merger Sub and the performance by each of Parent and
Merger Sub of its obligations under this Agreement have been duly authorized
by all necessary action on the part of each of Parent and Merger Sub. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger
Sub and, assuming the due execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of
Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by (i)
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws now or
hereafter in effect relating to creditors\' rights generally and (ii) general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is sought in a
proceeding in equity or at law).   (c) NO CONFLICT. The consummation of the
transactions under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement will not require
the consent, waiver or approval of any party to any material contract to
which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates is a party or by which
any of them is bound, or the consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
the registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority,
except for (i) any approvals or filings of notice under, or in connection
with, the Gaming Laws and the HSR Act, (ii) the filing and recordation of the
Articles of Merger as required by the NRS, and (iii) those consents, waivers
and approvals that relate to or are applicable to the Company or any of its
Affiliates but not to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates. Assuming
the consents, waivers and approvals set forth in the immediately preceding
clauses (i) and (ii) are obtained or made, as applicable, the execution,
delivery and performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement,
and the execution, delivery and performance by Parent of the Escrow
Agreement, will not (x) violate any law applicable to Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their Affiliates, (y) result in a breach or violation of any provision
of, or constitute a default under, any contract to which Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their Affiliates is a party or by which any of them is bound, or
(z) conflict with any provision of the charter, bylaws or
other organizational documents of Parent or Merger Sub, except in the case of
clauses (x) and (y) above, for any such breach, violation or default which
would not reasonably be expected to delay or prevent consummation of the
Merger.   (d) LITIGATION. There is no suit, action or proceeding
pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent, Merger Sub
or, if applicable, the Gaming Operator, or any of their Affiliates before
any Governmental Authority, which could prevent or delay the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (e) FINANCING. Parent has
obtained written commitments (the "FINANCING COMMITMENTS") for any and all
financing (whether equity financing, debt financing or otherwise) necessary
to pay the Enterprise Price and all fees, costs and expenses related to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"FINANCING"). Parent has provided true, accurate and complete copies of the
Financing Commitments to the Company, and Parent has paid all commitment fees
and any other fees and amounts due at or prior to the date hereof under the
Financing Commitments.   18   None of the Financing Commitments has been
amended, modified or terminated, and the respective commitments contained in
the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect
in any way materially adverse to the Company. The Financing Commitments are
in full force and effect and no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time (other than the expiration of the term thereof) or
both, would constitute a default on the part of Parent under any of the
Financing Commitments. There are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as set forth in or contemplated by the Financing
Commitments. The aggregate proceeds to be disbursed pursuant to the
agreements contemplated by the Financing Commitments, together with Parent\'s
cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient for Parent to pay the
Enterprise Price and all fees, costs and expenses related to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent has no reason
to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by the
Financing Commitments will not be satisfied or that Parent will not receive
the proceeds of the Financing on or prior the Closing Date.   (f) NO VOTE
REQUIRED. No vote of the stockholders of Parent is required by law, Parent\'s
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or otherwise for Parent and Merger Sub
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (g)
OPERATIONS OF MERGER SUB. Merger Sub is a direct wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent, was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and has engaged in no other
business activities.   (h) BROKERS, FINDERS, ETC. Except for Jefferies and
Company, Inc., neither Parent nor Merger Sub is subject to any valid claim of
any broker, investment banker, finder or other intermediary in connection
with the transactions under this Agreement. Parent is solely responsible for
any payment, fee or commission that may be due to Jefferies and Company, Inc.
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (i)
LICENSABILITY OF PRINCIPALS. None of Parent, Merger Sub or, if applicable,
the Gaming Operator, or any of their directors, officers, employees or
Affiliates, or other related Persons subject to licensure by a Gaming
Authority, has ever been denied, or had revoked or suspended, a
gaming license by any Gaming Authority. There are no facts, which if known to
the Gaming Authorities, would (a) be reasonably likely to result in the
denial, revocation, limitation or suspension of a gaming license or (b)
result in a negative outcome to any finding of suitability proceedings
currently pending, or under the suitability proceedings necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (j)
INVESTIGATION BY PARENT AND MERGER SUB. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges and agrees that it has conducted its own
independent investigation, review and analysis of the business, operations,
assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition, software,
technology and prospects of the Company, which investigation, review and
analysis was done by Parent and its Affiliates and, to the extent Parent
deemed appropriate, by Parent\'s agents and representatives. Without
limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that
the Total Transaction Consideration has been negotiated based on Parent\'s
express agreement that there would be no contingencies (financial or
otherwise) to Closing other than the conditions set forth in ARTICLE V. Each
of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that, should the Closing occur, except
as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will
acquire the Company and its business, properties, assets and liabilities in
an "as is" condition and on a "where is" basis, without any representation or
warranty of any kind, express or implied, except such representations and
warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement. Further, without limiting
any representation, warranty or covenant of the Company expressly set forth
herein, except as otherwise set forth in ARTICLE V, each of Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledges   19   that it has waived and hereby waives as a
condition to Closing any further due diligence reviews, inspections or
examinations with respect to the Company, including, without limitation, with
respect to engineering, environmental, title, survey, financial, operational,
regulatory and legal compliance matters.   ARTICLE IV  COVENANTS

AGREEMENT.   (a) Parent shall use its best efforts, at its expense, to
(i) repay or otherwise satisfy on or prior to the Closing Date all
outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, all accrued and unpaid
interest thereon and all other Obligations under the Credit Agreement, and
(ii) subject to SECTION 4.4(B) below, on or prior to the Closing Date, to
defease, repay or otherwise satisfy the entire outstanding aggregate
principal amount of the Company Bonds, all accrued and unpaid interest
thereon and all other Obligations under the Company Bonds (it being
understood that any amounts repaid or otherwise satisfied by Parent pursuant
to this SECTION 4.4 shall be deemed to be outstanding as of the Closing Date
for purposes of SECTION 2.2(A)(VII)(B)). Parent shall indemnify the Company,
the Stockholders and their respective directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates and representatives for any and all liabilities arising out of or
in connection with any action taken by the Company or any of the foregoing
Persons at the request of Parent and pursuant to this SECTION 4.4 to the
maximum extent permitted by law. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this

any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, including, without
limitation, SECTIONS 4.4(A) and 5.3(C), if (i) allowing a portion of the
Company Junior Notes to remain outstanding would not violate any provision of
law or regulation applicable to the Company or Parent or their respective
shareholders, and (ii) such portion of the Company Junior Notes may remain
outstanding without breaching the Financing Commitments or causing a
condition to the Financing Commitments not to be satisfied, then (A) Parent
shall not be obligated to pay, defease, redeem, purchase or otherwise satisfy
such portion of the Company Junior Notes and (B) the fact that Parent has not
caused such portion of Company Junior Notes to be paid, defeased, redeemed,
purchased or otherwise satisfied shall not affect or impair the obligations
of Parent or the Company hereunder.   24     SECTION 4.5 EMPLOYEE
BENEFIT PLANS. Parent hereby agrees that:   (a) For a period of one year
following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or one of its subsidiaries, to provide each employee of the
Company who was an employee of the Company (other than employees subject to
collective bargaining or similar agreements) immediately prior to the Closing
(each, an "AFFECTED EMPLOYEE") compensation and benefits that are
substantially similar, in the aggregate, to those benefits provided by the
Company Benefit Plans; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, in lieu of the foregoing,
Parent at its sole option may provide such Affected Employee with employee
benefits that, in the aggregate, are substantially similar to
those applicable to similarly situated employees of Parent.   (b) With
respect to each employee benefit plan, practice or policy of Parent or any of
its Affiliates, each Affected Employee shall be given credit under such plan
for all service prior to the Closing Date with the Company or any predecessor
employer (to the extent such credit was given by the Company or any
predecessor employer under a comparable plan, practice or policy), for
purposes of determining eligibility and vesting and levels of benefits;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, such service need not be credited to the extent (i) it
would result in a duplication of benefits or for benefit accrual
under defined benefit plans or (ii) is prohibited by applicable law.   (c)
If any Affected Employee is discharged by the Company as of or after the
Closing, then Parent shall be responsible for any and all severance costs for
such Affected Employee, including payments owing under those agreements,
plans or arrangements listed in SCHEDULE 3.1(O) of the Company Disclosure
Letter. Parent shall be responsible and assume all liability for all notices
or payments due to any Affected Employees, and all notices, payments, fines
or assessments due to any governmental entity, pursuant to any
applicable foreign, federal, state or local law, common law, statute, rule or
regulation with respect to the employment, discharge or layoff of employees
by the Company on or after the Closing Date, including the WARN Act or
similar state statute, Section 4980B of the Code and any rules or regulations
as have been issued in connection with the foregoing; PROVIDED, however, that
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent (including
giving notices if requested by Parent) in the giving of notices pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence, if any such notices are to be given.  
(d) Parent shall take all action as may be necessary and appropriate to cause
a tax-qualified 401(k) plan in which it or any of its subsidiaries sponsors
to accept the rollovers of all Affected Employees who elect such rollovers of
their 401(k) plan accounts and to provide the Affected Employees with a tax-
qualified 401(k) type plan effective immediately as of the Closing Date,
which plan shall recognize service with the Company and any predecessor
employer for purposes of eligibility, participation and vesting.   (e) In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as
prohibited by applicable law:   (i) at the Effective Time, each Affected
Employee immediately shall be eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all employee benefit plans of Parent and its Affiliates
(other than the Company and its subsidiaries) providing benefits to any
Affected Employees after the Effective Time (the "NEW PLANS") to the extent
coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a similar or comparable
Company Benefit Plans in which such Affected Employee participated
immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "OLD
PLANS");   25    (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
welfare benefits to any Affected Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions of such new Plan to be waived for such Affected
Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent such pre-existing
condition exclusions were in applicable to or had been satisfied by such
Affected Employee and his or her covered dependents immediately prior to the
Effective Time under the relevant Old Plan; and   (iii) each Affected
Employee and their eligible dependents shall receive credit for the plan year
in which the Effective Time (or commencement of participation in a New Plan)
occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for
expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time (or the date of commencement of
participation in a New Plan).   (f) From and after the Closing, Parent shall
be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the
Stockholders and their respective directors, officers, Affiliates,
representatives and agents, and the fiduciaries (including plan
administrators) of the Employee Benefit Plans of the Company, from and
against, any and all claims, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including
attorneys\' fees and expenses) and other liabilities and obligations relating
to or arising out of (i) all salaries, wages, commissions, employee incentive
or other compensation, severance, holiday, vacation, or retirement benefits
earned but unpaid as of the Closing and post-Closing bonuses due to any
Affected Employee; and (ii) any claims of, or damages or penalties sought by,
any Affected Employee, or any Governmental Authority on behalf of or
concerning any Affected Employee, with respect to any act or failure to act
by Parent to the extent arising from the employment, discharge, layoff or
termination of any Affected Employee, including any failure to perform or
breach by Parent under this SECTION 4.5.   (g) With respect to any accrued
but unused personal, sick or vacation time to which any Affected Employee is
entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or vacation policies applicable to
such Affected Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "PSV
POLICIES"), such Affected Employee shall be allowed to use such accrued
personal, sick or vacation time following the Closing Date, in accordance
with such PSV Policies.   (h) Parent acknowledges and agrees that any
employment loss within the meaning of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act (the "WARN ACT"), 29 U.S.C. ss.ss. 2101 et seq., suffered by
any employee immediately upon or within 90 days of the Closing, shall have
been caused by Parent\'s decision not to continue the employment of such
employee, and not by the sale of the Company. The Company acknowledges and
agrees that, at Parent\'s request, it shall give any notices required by the
WARN Act if necessary prior to the Closing Date and otherwise cooperate with
Parent. Parent shall be responsible to and shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Company and its Affiliates for any and all claims asserted under the WARN
Act because of a "plant closing" or "mass layoff," as defined therein,
occurring on or after the Closing Date, unless the Company does not cooperate
with Parent or provide requested notices as required by immediately preceding
sentence. For purposes of this Agreement, the Closing Date is and shall be
the same as the "effective date" of the sale within the meaning of the WARN
Act. Effective as of the Closing, Parent shall (i) assume liability for all
active workers\' compensation cases attributable to any employee and (ii)
provide employees with coverage for all workers\' compensation benefits and,
from and after Closing, Parent shall be responsible for all workers\'
compensation claims filed by employees, regardless of whether the underlying
event of such claims occurred prior to the Closing.   (i) Nothing herein
expressed or implied shall confer upon any current or former employee of the
Company or upon any representative of any such person, or upon any collective
bargaining agent, any rights or remedies, including any third party
beneficiary rights or any right to employment or continued employment for any
specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.   26    SECTION 4.6 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]   SECTION 4.7
FINANCIAL INFORMATION   (a) After the Closing, upon reasonable written
notice, Parent and the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the
Stockholders and their respective accountants, counsel and other
representatives access to, during normal business hours, such information
(including records pertinent to the Company) as is reasonably necessary for
financial reporting and accounting matters.   (b) Parent shall retain all
of the books and records of the Company for a period of five years after the
Closing Date or such longer time as may be required by law. After the end of
such period, before disposing of such books or records, Parent shall give
notice to such effect to the Stockholders and give the Stockholders an
opportunity to remove and retain all or any part of such books or records as
the Stockholders may select.   SECTION 4.8 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED].  
SECTION 4.9 PUBLICITY. Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that no public
release or announcement concerning the transactions under this
Agreement shall be issued by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates,
agents or representatives without the prior written consent and approval of
the Company and prior notice by the Company to the Gaming Authorities in
accordance with the Gaming Laws and consistent with the Company\'s
responsibilities as a gaming licensee and until after the Company and its
Affiliates have been given an opportunity to first issue such a public
release or announcement.   SECTION 4.10 CERTAIN UNDERSTANDINGS.   (a) Each
of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that it has received from the Company
certain projections, forecasts and information relating to the Company. Each
of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that (i) there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such projections and forecasts and in such
information, (ii) each of Parent and Merger Sub is familiar with such
uncertainties and is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation
of the adequacy and accuracy of all projections, forecasts and information so
furnished and (iii) neither Parent nor Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates
shall have any claim against the Company, the Stockholders or any of their
respective directors, officers, Affiliates, agents or representatives with
respect thereto. Accordingly, without limiting the generality of SECTION
3.1(U), the Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to such
projections, forecasts or information.   (b) Parent acknowledges that,
except as expressly set forth herein, without limiting the generality of
SECTION 3.1(U), neither the Company nor any other Person has made any
representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding the Company, and neither the
Company nor any other Person will be subject to any liability to Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Person resulting from the distribution to Parent or
Merger Sub, or the use of, any such information. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledges that, should the Closing occur, each of Parent and Merger
Sub will acquire the Company and its business, properties, assets and
liabilities in an "as is" condition and on a "where is" basis, without any
representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied, except such
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this
Agreement. Further, without limiting any representation, warranty or covenant
of the Company expressly set forth herein, each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges that it has waived and hereby waives as a condition to Closing
any further due diligence reviews, inspections or examinations with respect
to the Company,    27   including, without limitation, with respect to
engineering, environmental, title, survey, financial, operational, regulatory
and legal compliance matters.   SECTION 4.11 TAXES. All Taxes arising out
of, in connection with, or attributable to any preparatory act or the
transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement shall be borne (directly or,
if a Company level tax, indirectly) by Parent. In the case of any Transfer
Tax, Parent shall pay all such Transfer Taxes (whether imposed on Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Stockholder), shall prepare and timely file all
relevant Transfer Tax returns required to be filed in respect of such
Transfer Tax and shall pay the Transfer Tax shown on such Transfer Tax
return. For purposes of this Agreement, "TRANSFER TAX" or "TRANSFER TAXES"

recording, ad valorem, privilege, documentary, gross receipts, registration,
conveyance, excise, license, stamp, duties, or similar taxes and fees.  
SECTION 4.12 CERTAIN NOTIFICATIONS. From the date of this Agreement until the
Closing, the Company, on one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall
promptly notify the other in writing regarding (a) any breach of any covenant
or obligation of such party hereunder, as applicable, and (b) any
fact, circumstance, event or action which will result in, or would reasonably
be expected to result in, the failure of such party to timely satisfy any of
the closing conditions specified in ARTICLE V, as applicable.   SECTION
4.13 INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.   (a) Parent agrees that (i)
all rights to indemnification existing in favor of any director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") as provided in
its charter or bylaws or in indemnification agreements with the Company or
any other Person, or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof, shall survive
the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not
less than six years from the Closing Date and (ii) Parent shall guarantee the
performance by the Company of its obligations referred to in immediately
preceding clause (i); PROVIDED that, in the event any claim or claims are
asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification
in respect of any such claim or claims, and Parent\'s guarantee with respect
thereto, shall continue until final disposition of any and all such claims.
Parent also agrees to indemnify all Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law with respect to all acts and omissions arising
out of such individuals\' services as directors, officers, employees or
agents of the Company or as trustees or fiduciaries of any plan for the
benefit of employees or directors of, or otherwise on behalf of, the Company,
occurring prior to the Closing Date including, without limitation, the
transactions under this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, if any such Indemnified Party is or becomes involved in any
capacity in any action, proceeding or investigation in connection with any
matter, arising out of such individuals\' services as directors, officers,
employees or agents of the Company or as trustees or fiduciaries of any plan
for the benefit of employees or directors of, or otherwise on behalf of, the
Company, including the transactions under this Agreement, occurring prior to
or at the Closing, Parent shall pay as incurred such Indemnified Party\'s
reasonable out-of-pocket legal and other expenses (including the cost of any
investigation and preparation) incurred in connection therewith. From and
after the Closing, Parent shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses,
including attorneys\' fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this SECTION
4.13.   (b) Parent agrees that, from and after the Closing, the
Company shall cause to be maintained in effect for not less than six years
from the Closing Date the current policies of the directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance maintained by the Company; PROVIDED that the Company may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms
and conditions which are no less advantageous to the directors and officers
covered by such policies and PROVIDED that such substitution shall not result
in any gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to
the    28   Closing; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the Company shall not be
required to pay an annual premium in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof, and if the Company is
unable to obtain the insurance required by this SECTION 4.13(B) it shall
obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium equal
to such maximum amount.   SECTION 4.14 DEBT FINANCING   (a) From the date

the Company and any necessary "comfort letters," (D) forming, on or prior to
the Closing Date, new wholly owned subsidiaries, and transferring assets into
those subsidiaries, to the extent not prohibited by law or any contracts to
which the Company is a party or is bound (provided that in the event a
contract prohibits such transfer and the transfer cannot otherwise be
structured in a manner to avoid conflict with the terms of such contract, the
Company agrees to use reasonable efforts to obtain consents necessary to
effectuate such transfers), and (E) provide reasonable access to the Owned
Real Property, in accordance with SECTION 4.2, during normal business hours
to the extent necessary for Parent to obtain surveys, engineering reports,

their respective officers, directors or Affiliates to (x) enter into or

debt securities), or (z) obtain any rating agency confirmations or approvals,
(ii) require counsel to the Company or the Stockholders to deliver any legal

(ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation and warranty (without
giving effect to any qualifiers or exceptions relating to knowledge,
Knowledge of the Company, materiality or Material Adverse Effect) made by the
Company in this Agreement if such inaccuracy or breach, individually or
together with all such other inaccuracies or breaches, would be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,  in each case, by
virtue of the failure of such representation or warranty to be true and
correct (i) on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as though made
on and as of the Closing Date (other than any such representation or warranty
that speaks as of a specific date or time other than the Closing Date) or
(ii) on and as of the date or time when made, in the case of

made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement by virtue of its failure to be
true and correct (i) on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as
though made on and as of the Closing Date (other than any such representation

Date) or (ii) on and as of the date or time when made, in the case of any

which there may only be recovered those Losses in excess of the Indemnity
Threshold, subject to the conditions of this ARTICLE VII, including the
limitations set forth in SECTION 7.5.   SECTION 7.5 MAXIMUM
INDEMNIFICATION. The Stockholders shall not be obligated to provide

extent that the balance of the Indemnification Escrow Fund is not
sufficient to satisfy any indemnification obligations of the Stockholders to
the Parent Indemnitees under SECTION 7.2 when the conditions for

shortfall shall be satisfied from any balance remaining in the PMR/RWB Escrow
Funds pursuant to, and in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions of, the PMR/RWB Escrow Agreement.   SECTION 7.6 NO TAX ATTRIBUTE

indemnification shall be provided for the absence or loss of any tax
attributes, including by reason of a breach of SECTION 3.1(N)(I) and/or
SECTION 3.1(N)(VII); provided, that for the avoidance of doubt, the Parent
Indemnitees shall be, subject to the limitations on indemnification otherwise
set forth in this ARTICLE VII, indemnified for (and this SECTION 7.6 does not
limit), a breach of SECTION 3(N)(I) that gives rise to a liability for Taxes
of the Company for pre-Closing periods (as opposed to a reduction of tax
attributes carried forward to a post-Closing period).   SECTION 7.7 NOTICE;
PROCEDURE FOR THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS.   (a) Any Person entitled to
indemnification under Article VII (an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") may seek
indemnification for any Loss or potential Loss by giving written notice to
the applicable party or parties from whom indemnification is sought (the
"INDEMNIFYING PARTY") before, if applicable, the Expiration Date. Written
notice to such Indemnifying Party of the existence of a claim shall be given
by the Indemnified Party as soon as practicable after the Indemnified Party
first receives notice of the potential claim, PROVIDED that any failure to
provide such prompt notice of the existence of a claim to the applicable
Indemnifying Party shall not affect the Indemnified Party\'s right to   
37   seek indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE VII except and only to
the extent that such failure results in such Indemnifying Party actually
incurring an expense or otherwise being prejudiced as a result of such delay.
In the case of a claim involving a Third Party Claim (as hereinafter
defined), (i) the notice of claim shall describe in reasonable detail the
facts known to the Indemnified Party giving rise to such indemnification
claim and the amount, or good faith estimate of the amount, of Losses arising
therefrom, and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Stockholders\'
Representative (if the Indemnified Party is a Parent Indemnitee) or to Parent
(if the Indemnified Party is a Stockholder Indemnitee), as applicable,
promptly after the Indemnified Party\'s receipt thereof, copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Party relating to such Third Party Claim.   (b) In the case of any claim
asserted by a Person that is not a party to this Agreement against an
Indemnified Party (a "THIRD-PARTY CLAIM"), the Indemnified Party shall permit
the Indemnifying Party (at the expense of such Indemnifying Party) to assume
the defense of such Third-Party Claim and any litigation or proceeding
resulting therefrom; provided that (i) counsel for the Indemnifying Party who
shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and (ii) the Indemnified Party may
participate in such defense at such Indemnified Party\'s expense.
Notwithstanding the election of the Indemnifying Party to assume control of
such defense, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain or assume the
defense of such Third-Party Claims (at such Indemnified Party\'s expense) if
(A) the amount of Losses from such claim (x) if the Indemnified Party is a
Parent Indemnitee, could reasonably be expected to exceed, when aggregated
with all other pending claims and unpaid claims for indemnification from such
Indemnifying Party (together with, in the case of any Stockholder as the
Indemnifying Party, pending claims and unpaid claims for indemnification from
each such other Indemnifying Party), the Indemnification Escrow Fund, and (y)
if the Indemnified Party is a Stockholder Indemnitee, otherwise may not,
in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified Party, be capable of being
satisfied in full by such Indemnifying Party; (B) the claim for
indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the business of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation; or (C) the Indemnified Party has been advised in
writing by counsel that a conflict of interest exists between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party with respect to such claim
(including the defense thereof). No Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any
Third-Party Claim, shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement without the consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent may be
withheld in the Indemnified Party\'s sole discretion (unless the terms of
such judgment or settlement include an unconditional full release of the
Indemnified Party from all liability with respect to such Third-Party
Claim and solely the payment of money and all such moneys shall be paid by
the Indemnifying Party, in which case such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld). In the event that the Indemnifying Party does not
accept the defense of any matter as above provided, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to defend against any such claim or demand, and shall be
entitled to settle or agree to pay in full such claim or demand. In any
event, the parties to this Agreement shall cooperate in the defense of any
Third-Party Claim subject to this ARTICLE VII and the records of each shall
be made reasonably available to the other with respect to such defense.  
SECTION 7.8 SURVIVAL OF INDEMNITY. Any matter as to which a claim has been
asserted in good faith by an Indemnified Party, by formal notice satisfying
the requirements of SECTION 7.7, and prior to the Expiration Date, that is
pending or unresolved as of the Expiration Date, by law or otherwise shall
continue to be covered by this Article VII notwithstanding such
limitation (which the parties hereby waive solely with respect to such
circumstances), until such matter is finally terminated or otherwise resolved
by the parties under this Agreement, by an arbitration or by a court of
competent jurisdiction and any amounts payable hereunder are finally
determined and paid.    38    SECTION 7.9 NO CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
person shall be liable to or otherwise responsible for consequential,
incidental or punitive damages.   SECTION 7.10 NO DOUBLE RECOVERY.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to indemnification under any provision of this Agreement for any
amount to the extent such Indemnified Party has been indemnified or
reimbursed for such amount under any other provision of this Agreement
(including, (i) to the extent that such amount reduced Total Transaction
Consideration or Working Capital, if the Indemnified Party is a Parent
Indemnitee, and (ii) to the extent that such amount increased Total
Transaction Consideration or Working Capital, if the Indemnified Party is a
Stockholder Indemnitee) or any other agreement or action at law or equity
