AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of May 19, 2006 (this " _Agreement_ "), by and among Briad Main Street, Inc., a Nevada corporation (" _Parent_ "), Main Street Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent (the " _Purchaser_ "), and Main Street Restaurant Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

 _Recitals_  

   

 WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Parent, the Purchaser, and the Company have each determined that it is fair to and in the best interests of their respective stockholders for Parent to acquire the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, Parent proposes to cause Purchaser to make a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the Company (the " _Shares_ ") (including the associated preferred stock purchase rights (the " _Rights_ ") issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated as of May 23, 2005 between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, Inc., as rights agent, as amended (the " _Rights Agreement_ ")) at a price per Share of $6.40, subject to any applicable withholding for Taxes, net to the seller in cash (such price, or any greater price per Share paid pursuant to the Offer, the " _Share Offer Price_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Board_ ") has unanimously approved the making of the Offer and is recommending that the CompanyÂ’s stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer; 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Parent, the Purchaser, and the Company have each approved this Agreement and declared its advisability and approved the merger of the Purchaser with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding Share not owned directly or indirectly by the Parent, the Purchaser, or the Company will be converted into the right to receive the Share Offer Price in cash; 

  

 WHEREAS, Parent, Purchaser, and Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and the Merger; and 

  

 WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to the willingness of the Parent and the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement (and effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent, Purchaser, and certain stockholders of the Company have entered into a Stock Tender and Voting Agreement dated as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Stockholder Agreement_ "). 

   ##### 

  

  

 _Agreement_  

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements set forth in this Agreement, Parent, Purchaser, and Company agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 
 THE OFFER 

   

 Section 1.01 _The Offer_. 

   

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 8.01, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer promptly after the date of this Agreement, but in any event not later than June 1, 2006. The obligation of the Purchaser to accept for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to (i) the condition (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") that at least the number of Shares that, when added to Shares then owned by Parent and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliates, shall constitute at least ninety percent (90%) of the then outstanding Shares shall have been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer and (ii) the satisfaction or waiver of each of the other conditions set forth in attached Annex I hereto. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive any such conditions, to increase the Offer Price, and to make any other changes in the terms of the Offer; provided that without the prior written consent of the Company, the Purchaser shall not, and Parent shall cause Purchaser not to, waive the Minimum Condition, extend the Offer except as expressly provided below, decrease the price per Share or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, decrease the number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, impose conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex I, or amend any other term of the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of any Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser may, without the prior consent of the Company, prior to the termination of this Agreement, (x) extend the Offer for an aggregate period of not more than 10 business days beyond the scheduled expiration date, which initially shall be 20 business days following the commencement of the Offer (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ "), if, at any scheduled expiration of the Offer, any of the conditions to PurchaserÂ’s obligations to accept the Shares for payment shall not be satisfied or waived, (y) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, or interpretation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), or the staff thereof, applicable to the Offer, or (z) extend the Offer (one or more times) for an aggregate period of not more than 10 business days beyond the latest applicable date that would otherwise be permitted under clause (x) or (y) of this sentence, if, as of such date, all of the conditions to PurchaserÂ’s obligations to accept the Shares for payment are satisfied or waived, but the number of Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer totals less than ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding Shares (including Shares already owned by Parent and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliates). In addition, (1) if, on the Initial Expiration Date, the sole condition remaining unsatisfied is the failure of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), to have expired or been terminated, then Purchaser shall, without the prior written consent of the Company, extend the Offer from time to time until the fifth business day after 

   ##### 

  

   

expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act
or (2) if, on the Initial Expiration Date, the sole condition remaining
unsatisfied is the condition set forth in paragraph (g) of Annex I,
the Purchaser may, for so long as the Company is using its commercially
reasonable efforts to cure such breach, extend the Offer from time to time
until five business days after such breach is cured, provided that Purchaser
shall not be required pursuant to this clause (2) to extend the Offer beyond
30 calendar days after the Initial Expiration Date. The Company agrees that
no Shares held by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company will be
tendered pursuant to the Offer. Subject to the terms of the Offer and this
Agreement and the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by this
Agreement) of all the conditions to the Offer, Purchaser shall, and Parent
shall cause Purchaser to, accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly after the
expiration of the Offer. Each of the Parent and the Purchaser shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to avoid the occurrence of any Event
specified in Annex I or to cure any such Event that shall have occurred. 

   

 (b) Parent shall cause Purchaser to file with the SEC on the date the Offer is commenced a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "), which shall contain (as an exhibit thereto) the PurchaserÂ’s Offer to Purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") which shall be mailed to the holders of Shares with respect to the Offer. The Offer Documents will comply in all material respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities laws and, on the date filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent, or given to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by the Parent or the Purchaser with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents. Each of the Parent and the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Purchaser further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to stockholders of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Offer Documents (including any amendments or supplements thereto) prior to such documents being filed with the SEC. 

   

 (c) Parent, Purchaser, and the Company agree that if all of the conditions to the Offer other than the Minimum Condition have been satisfied as of the expiration date of the Offer (as such expiration date may have been extended in accordance with Section 1.01(a)) and Purchaser elects not to waive the Minimum Condition, then Parent and Purchaser shall terminate the Offer (or otherwise permit the Offer to expire) and the Company shall solicit the approval of its stockholders for a merger (the " _Cash Merger_ ") of the Company with Purchaser in accordance with Article II, and the Cash Merger shall be governed by the other provisions of this Agreement relating to the Merger, Effective Time, Proxy Statement, Merger Price, Closing, and like terms, all of which shall apply to the Cash Merger, and in such case each issued and outstanding Share, Option, and Warrant will be treated in accordance with Article II and Article III. If the Offer is terminated and a Cash Merger is required pursuant to this Section 1.01(c), (i) 

   ##### 

  

   

the Company and Parent shall promptly undertake the actions contemplated by
Section 2.10 as if the Purchaser had accepted for payment and paid for Shares
in the Offer; (ii) the obligations of the Parent, the Purchaser, and the
Company to effect the Cash Merger shall be subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in Annex I hereto; and (iii) each Party
shall continue to have the obligations set forth in Article VI and to be
subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII with respect to the Cash
Merger. 

  

 Section 1.02 _Company Actions_. 

   

 (a) The Company hereby approves of, and consents to, the Offer. The Company shall, contemporaneously with the commencement of the Offer and the filing of the PurchaserÂ’s Schedule TO, file with the SEC and mail to the holders of Shares a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 as required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Schedule 14D-9 shall set forth, and the Company hereby represents and warrants, that the Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has unanimously: (i) determined that this Agreement, the Offer, and the Merger are fair to and in the best interests of the CompanyÂ’s stockholders; (ii) approved this Agreement, the Offer, and the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and declared the advisability of this Agreement; (iii) approved this Agreement, the Offer, and the Merger in accordance with Section 203 of the DGCL; and (iv) resolved to recommend acceptance of the Offer, the tendering of their Shares to Purchaser, and approval of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement by the CompanyÂ’s stockholders; provided, however, that such recommendation and approval may be withdrawn, modified, or amended to the extent that the Board determines in good faith (after having consulted with outside legal counsel) that such action is necessary in order for its directors to comply with their fiduciary duties to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders under applicable law.

If the number of directors who are not Purchaser Insiders is reduced below three for any reason prior to the Effective Time, the remaining directors who are not Purchaser Insiders (or if there is only one director who is not a Purchaser Insider, the remaining director who is not a Purchaser Insider) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be entitled to designate a person (or persons) to fill such vacancy (or vacancies) who is not an officer, director, stockholder, or designee of the Purchaser or any of its affiliates and who shall be a director not deemed to be a Purchaser Insider for all purposes of this Agreement.

The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to such Section and Rule in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.03 and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors as is required under such Section and Rule in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.03; provided, however, that Parent will supply and be responsible for any information with respect to itself and its officers, directors, and affiliates required by such Section and Rule to the Company.

 Section 1.04 _Top-Up Option_. 

   

 (a) The Company hereby grants to the Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase that number of newly issued Shares (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by the Parent and the Purchaser immediately prior to the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute one Share more than 90% of the Shares then outstanding (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) at a price per Share equal to the Share Offer Price; provided, however, that the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable unless immediately after such exercise the Purchaser would own more than 90% of the Shares then outstanding; provided, further, that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of Shares in excess of the CompanyÂ’s then authorized but unissued Shares (giving effect to such Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding Options and Warrants as though such Shares were outstanding.) 

   

 (b) The Purchaser may exercise the Top-Up Option, in whole but not in part, at any one time after the occurrence of a Top-Up Exercise Event and prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time, (ii) the date that is ten business days after the occurrence of a Top-Up Exercise Event, and (iii) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms. For purposes of this Agreement a " _Top-Up Exercise Event_ " shall occur only upon PurchaserÂ’s acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer constituting at least 85% but less than 90% of the Shares then outstanding. 

   

 (c) In the event Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Purchaser shall so notify the Company in writing, and shall set forth in such notice (i) the number of Shares that are expected to be owned by Purchaser immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, and (ii) the place and time of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, notify Purchaser of the number of Shares then outstanding and the number of Top-Up Shares. At the Top-Up Closing, Purchaser shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares (1) by wire transfer of same day funds to a bank account designated by the Company, (2) by delivery of a promissory note on market terms in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and guaranteed by the Parent, or (3) by a combination thereof, and the Company shall cause to be delivered to Purchaser a certificate or certificates representing the Top-Up Shares. 

   

 (d) The obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the following conditions: (i) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act relating to the issuance of the Top-Up Shares shall have expired or been terminated; (ii) no provision of any Law and no order or decree shall prohibit the exercise 

   ##### 

  

   

of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares in respect of any
such exercise; and (iii) either (1) delivery of the Top-Up Shares would not
require the approval of the CompanyÂ’s stockholders pursuant to the rules and
regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market, or (2) Purchaser shall have notified
the Company in writing that it intends to cause the Effective Time to occur
no later than three business days after the Top-Up Closing. 

   

 (e) The Parent and the Purchaser understand that the Shares that the Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public transaction. The Purchaser is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor" (as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act). Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by the Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act. 

   

 (f) Certificates evidencing the Top-Up Shares delivered hereunder may, at the CompanyÂ’s election, contain the following legend: 

  

THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED, OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED
EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT
OF 1933 OR AN EXEMPTION THEREFROM.

ARTICLE III 
 PAYMENT FOR SHARES 

   

 Section 3.01 _Payment For Shares_. 

   

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company shall act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") in effecting the payment of the Merger Price in respect of certificates (the " _Share Certificates_ ") that, prior to the Effective Time, represented Shares entitled to payment of the Merger Price pursuant to Section 2.07. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Price to which holders of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.07 (such funds being referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). 

   

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each record holder of Share Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (other than Share Certificates representing (i) Shares held by the Parent, the Purchaser, any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Parent or the Purchaser, the Company, or any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company or (ii) Dissenting Shares) a form of letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Share Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Share Certificates to the Paying Agent and instructions for use in surrendering such Share Certificates and receiving the aggregate Merger Price in respect of such Shares. Upon the surrender of each such Share Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall pay the holder of such Share Certificate the applicable Merger Price multiplied by the number of Shares formerly represented by such Share Certificate in consideration therefor, and such Share Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered, each such Share Certificate (other than Share Certificates representing (i) Shares held by the Parent, the Purchaser, any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Parent or the Purchaser, the Company, or any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company or (ii) Dissenting Shares) shall represent solely the right to receive the aggregate Merger Price relating to such Shares in cash. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the Merger Price. If the Merger Price (or any portion thereof) is to be delivered to any person other than the person in whose name the Share Certificate formerly representing Shares surrendered therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to such right to receive such Merger Price that the Share Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person surrendering such Share Certificate shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Price to a person other than the registered holder of the Share Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Purchaser that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) Promptly following the date that is 180 days after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation all cash remaining in the Exchange Fund (including interest received with respect thereto), Share Certificates, and other documents in its possession relating to the transactions described in this Agreement, and the Paying AgentÂ’s duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a Share Certificate formerly representing a Share may surrender such Share Certificate to the Surviving Corporation and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat, and similar laws) receive in consideration therefor the aggregate Merger Price relating to such Shares, without any interest or dividends thereon. 

   

 (d) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of any Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Share Certificates formerly representing Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, they shall be surrendered and cancelled in return for the payment of the aggregate Merger Price as provided in this Article III. 

   

 (e) To the fullest extent permitted by law, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of the Paying Agent, the Parent, the Purchaser, the Company, or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares or other securities for any consideration to be paid in the Merger delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar law. 

   

 (f) Each of the Surviving Corporation, the Parent, and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or other securities such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of payments under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local, or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, the Parent, or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or other securities in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, the Parent, or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. 

   

 (g) If any Share Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Share Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed and, if required by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft, or destruction of such Share Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed Share Certificate, the Merger Price, without any interest thereon. 

   

 (h) The Paying Agent shall invest the funds constituting the Exchange Fund as directed by the Parent. Any interest or other income resulting from such investment shall be paid to the Parent.

ARTICLE IV 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 

   

 Except as set forth in the disclosure schedules delivered to the Parent by the Company (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") concurrently herewith (it being understood that any disclosed matter, the import of which is fairly described in one section of the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall be deemed to be effective disclosure in all sections of the Company Disclosure Schedule for which its application is reasonably apparent from such description), the Company hereby represents and warrants to the Parent and the Purchaser that: 

  

 Section 4.01 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Each of the CompanyÂ’s subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization. The Company and each of its subsidiaries has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate, or lease its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the properties owned, operated, or leased by it makes such qualification, licensing, or good standing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed, or in good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The term " _Material Adverse Effect on the Company_ " means any change or effect that is or could reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the business, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, either alone or in combination, or the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than a change or effect (a) resulting from a change in general economic conditions or a change in securities markets in general, (b) resulting from a change affecting the restaurant industry generally that does not affect the Company and its subsidiaries to a materially disproportionate degree from other entities operating in such industry, or (c) resulting primarily from the announcement or pendency of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 4.02 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Company has made available to the Parent and the Purchaser a complete and correct copy of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws, or other organizational documents as amended to the date of this Agreement, of the Company and each subsidiary of the Company. Such certificates of incorporation, bylaws, and other organizational documents are in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in violation of any provision of its certificate of incorporation, bylaws, or organizational documents. 

  

 Section 4.03 _Capitalization_. 

   

 (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 25,000,000 Shares and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 25,000 shares are designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the " _Series A Stock_"). As of the close of business on May 12, 2006, there were 17,230,176 Shares and no shares of Series A Stock issued and outstanding, and no Shares were held in treasury. The Company has no shares of capital stock reserved for issuance, except that, as of May 12, 2006, there were (a) 3,360,918 Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding and unexpired Options, (b) 127,500 Shares reserved for 

   #####

issuance pursuant to outstanding restricted stock units, (c) 581,395 Shares
reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding Warrants, and (d) 25,000
shares of Series A Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the Rights

authorized, issued, or outstanding. Section 4.03 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth the holders of all outstanding Options, restricted stock
units, and Warrants and the number, class of securities, and exercise prices
of each grant to such holders. Since May 12, 2006, the Company has not
issued any shares of capital stock or securities exchangeable or convertible
into capital stock except pursuant to the exercise of Options. All the
outstanding Shares are, and all Shares that may be issued pursuant to the
exercise of outstanding Options and Warrants will be, when issued
in accordance with the respective terms thereof, duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid, and nonassessable, and are not subject to nor were they
issued in violation of any preemptive rights. Following the Effective Time,
no holder of Options will have any right to receive shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation upon exercise of such Options. There are no bonds,
debentures, notes, or other indebtedness having general voting rights (or
convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having such rights) ("
_Voting Debt_ ") of the Company or any of its subsidiaries issued and
outstanding. Except as set forth in this Section 4.03 and except for
the Rights and the Top-Up Option, there are no existing options, warrants,
calls, subscriptions, or other rights, agreements, arrangements, or
commitments of any character, relating to the issued or unissued capital
stock of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, obligating the Company or any
of its subsidiaries to issue, transfer, or sell, or cause to be issued,
transferred, or sold, any shares of capital stock or Voting Debt of, or other
equity interest in, the Company or any of its subsidiaries or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity interests, nor are
there any obligations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to grant,
extend, or enter into any such option, warrant, call, subscription, or other
right, agreement, arrangement, or commitment. There are no outstanding
contractual obligations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire any Shares or other capital stock of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Section 4.03
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of the Company there are
no outstanding proxies with respect to the Shares and there are no agreements
or understandings by or among any persons that affect or relate to the voting
of, or the execution of written consents with respect to, any security of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Each of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of each of the CompanyÂ’s subsidiaries is duly authorized,

Each of the Parent and the Purchaser has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate, or lease its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the properties owned, operated, or leased by it makes such qualification, licensing, or good standing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed, or in good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. The term " _Material Adverse Effect on Parent_ " means any change in or effect on the business, results of operations, or financial condition of the Parent or any of its subsidiaries that would materially impair the ability of the Parent or the Purchaser to timely satisfy its obligations under this Agreement.

necessary to authorize or approve this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than, with respect to the
Merger, the filing of the appropriate merger documents as required by the
DGCL). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of the
Parent and the Purchaser and, assuming the due and valid authorization,

 (b) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Parent and the Purchaser, the consummation by the Parent and the Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or compliance by the Parent and the Purchaser with any of the provisions of this Agreement will require Parent or Purchaser to obtain any Consent of any Governmental Entity, except for (i) compliance with any applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger pursuant to the DGCL, (iii) compliance with applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws, (iv) compliance with the HSR Act and any requirements of any foreign or supranational antitrust laws, and (v) Consents the failure of which to obtain or make could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

reasonable request, any other person, required in connection with, and
waivers of any breaches or violations of any material contracts, permits,
licenses, or other agreements that may be caused by, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Offer and this Agreement; provided, however,
that the Company (i) need not use any effort to obtain the Consent of the
CompanyÂ’s lenders pursuant to the agreements set forth in the SEC Reports and
(ii) need not expend funds to obtain Consents from persons other than
Governmental Entities unless Parent has agreed to reimburse the
Company therefor. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto hereby agree

   ##### 

  

   

this Agreement by the Company or Parent. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 6.04(b) and 6.04(c), in the event that either Parent or the Company
is requested, as a condition to obtaining the approval of any Governmental
Antitrust Entity to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to
divest material assets or take any other action which, if taken, could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the combined
consolidated businesses, assets, operations, or prospects of the Parent and
the Company, then neither the Parent nor the Company shall be required to
take such action, and no failure by either the Parent or the Company to take
such action shall be deemed a breach of this Section 6.04 or of any other
provision of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.05 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release announcing the terms of this Agreement shall be a joint press release. Thereafter, Parent, Purchaser, and the Company each agree to consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, agree to provide to the other party for review a copy of any such press release or public statement, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation and review, unless required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with a securities exchange.

 (a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification now existing in favor of any individual who at or prior to the Effective Time was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in their respective charters, bylaws, or indemnification agreements, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time unless otherwise required by law, provided that in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until final disposition of any and all such claims. 

   

 (b) Parent agrees that from and after the Effective Time, it shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect for not less than six years from the Effective Time the policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries at the date of this Agreement; provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and containing terms and conditions which, in the aggregate, are no less advantageous to the beneficiaries of the current policies and with carriers comparable in terms of creditworthiness to those that have written the policies maintained by the Company at the date of this Agreement; and provided further that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium in excess of three times the annual premium relating to the year during which this Agreement is executed and if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 6.06(b) for that amount, it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for such maximum amount. 

   

 (c) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide employees of the Company who continue employment after the Effective Time (" _Employees_ ") with benefits substantially comparable (except for such 

   ##### 

  

   

changes as may be required by law) in the aggregate to those provided under
the CompanyÂ’s benefit plans, programs, and arrangements and compensation
policies and practices in effect at the Effective Time (excluding any
incentive compensation arrangements). The Surviving Corporation shall credit
each Employee, for all purposes under all benefit plans, programs, and
arrangements and compensation policies and practices of the Surviving
Corporation in which such Employee is eligible to participate by virtue of
his or her employment after the Effective Time, with all previous service to
the extent recognized by the Company, its subsidiaries, or its predecessors
for benefit plan purposes, including, without limitation, vacation time and
sick days, except to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of
benefits. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the Surviving Corporation
from terminating any Employee for any reason or no reason, and such Employees
shall be employed "at will." 

  

 Section 6.07 _No Solicitation_. 

   

 (a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit or cause any of its subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any Company Representatives to, directly or indirectly (except as otherwise contemplated by this Section 6.07), (i) initiate, solicit, encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information or assistance), induce or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or other nonpublic information or data to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, whether made before or after the date of this Agreement, or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to Purchaser, the approval or recommendation by the Board of the Offer, this Agreement, or the Merger, or (iv) cause the Company to enter into an Acquisition Agreement or approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that prior to the acceptance for payment of the Shares pursuant to the Offer (or the approval by the stockholders, if a Cash Merger pursuant to Article II of this Agreement is utilized), the Company may, and may authorize and permit the Company Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished confidential or other nonpublic information and may participate in such negotiations and discussions or take any other action otherwise prohibited by this Section 6.07(a) with any person (unless such other action is subject to the restrictions of Section 6.07(b), in which case such other action shall only be permitted in accordance with such restrictions) that, after the date of this Agreement, makes a bona fide unsolicited proposal to enter into a business combination with the Company pursuant to an Acquisition Proposal that the Board in good faith reasonably determines (after having consulted with outside legal counsel and its independent financial advisor) is likely to result in a Superior Acquisition Proposal, but only if and to the extent that (i) the Board determines in good faith (after having consulted with outside legal counsel) that such action is necessary in order for its directors to comply with their fiduciary duties under applicable law, (ii) prior to taking such action, the Company (A) provides advance written notice to the Parent that it has received a request for nonpublic information (including a summary of the material terms of the Acquisition Proposal) and that it intends to take such action and (B) receives from such person an executed confidentiality agreement in reasonably customary form and in any event containing terms at least as stringent as those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, (iii) prior to furnishing any nonpublic information to any such person, the Company furnishes such nonpublic 

   ##### 

  

   

information to the Parent (to the extent that such nonpublic information has
not been previously furnished by the Company to the Parent), and (iv) neither
the Company nor any of its subsidiaries nor any of the
Company Representatives shall have violated any of the provisions set forth
in this Section 6.07. The Company shall keep the Purchaser promptly and
reasonably informed with respect to the status of any such request and any
modifications thereto. The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions, or negotiations with any
parties conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any of
the foregoing. If not previously requested, the Company also will promptly
request each person that has executed prior to the date of this Agreement a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of
an Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all confidential or other
nonpublic information furnished to such person by the Company or on the
CompanyÂ’s behalf prior to the date of this Agreement. Neither the Company nor
any of its subsidiaries shall terminate, amend, modify, or waive any
provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a
party and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law, the provisions of any such
agreement, including, but not limited to, by obtaining injunctions to prevent
any breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions thereof in any court having jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 6.07 shall prevent the Company
from complying with Rule 14e-2 and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal or from making any disclosure to
the CompanyÂ’s stockholders if the Board determines in good faith (after
having consulted with outside legal counsel) that such disclosure is required
by law or necessary in order for the CompanyÂ’s directors to comply with their
fiduciary duties under applicable law. 

   

 (b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.07(b), the Board (or any committee thereof) shall not approve any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, or similar agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ "). The Company may, however, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e)(ii) if (i) the Board has received a Superior Acquisition Proposal, (ii) in light of such Superior Acquisition Proposal, the Board has determined in good faith (after having consulted with outside legal counsel) that it would be necessary for the Board to terminate this Agreement in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, (iii) the Company has notified Parent in writing of the price and other material terms of the Superior Acquisition Proposal and the determinations described in clause (ii) above, (iv) at least three (3) business days following receipt by the Parent of the notice referred to in clause (iii) above, and taking into account any revised proposal made by Parent in writing since receipt of the notice referred to in clause (iii) above, such Superior Acquisition Proposal (as the same may have been modified or amended, but provided that Parent shall have received the foregoing requisite notice of any such modification or amendment) remains a Superior Acquisition Proposal and the Board has again made the determinations referred to in clause (ii) above, (v) during the three (3) business day period referred to in the preceding clause (iv), the Company and its advisors shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable Parent to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (vi) the Company shall not be in material breach of the provisions of Section 6.07(a) or 6.07(b), (vii) the Board concurrently or previously approves, and the Company concurrently or previously enters into, a definitive Acquisition Agreement providing for the implementation of such Superior Acquisition Proposal, and (viii) the Company shall have paid 

   ##### 

  

   

the Termination Fee and Parent Expenses required by Section 8.03(b), in the
manner contemplated thereby. The term " _Superior Acquisition Proposal_ "
means any Acquisition Proposal that the Board determines in its good faith
judgment (after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel and
independent financial advisor) to be (A) on terms superior in value from a
financial point of view and more favorable to the holders of Shares than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account all the
terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any
offer by the Parent to amend the terms of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement), and (B) reasonably capable of being completed, taking into
account all financial, regulatory, legal, and other aspects of such proposal
and the identity and nature of the financing of the person or entity making
such proposal. 

  

 Section 6.08 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent and the Company shall promptly notify each other of (a) any notice or other communication from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (b) any notice or other communication from any governmental or regulatory agency or authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or regarding any violation, or alleged violation of law; (c) any material actions, suits, claims, investigations, or proceedings commenced or, to the best of its knowledge, threatened against, relating to, or involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its subsidiaries or their assets, businesses, or properties or their officers or directors or which relates to the consummation of the Offer or the Merger; (d) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any fact or event which would be reasonably likely (i) to cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, (ii) to cause any material covenant, condition, or agreement under this Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied in all material respects, or (iii) to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or a Material Adverse Effect on Parent; and (e) any failure of the Company, the Parent or the Purchaser, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement in any material respect; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the representations or warranties of any party or the conditions to the obligations of any party under this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.09 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of any stockholder litigation against the Company or its officers or directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.10 _Exemption From Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Parent and Company shall take all such steps as may be required or reasonably requested to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, such steps to be taken in accordance with the No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, or as may otherwise be reasonably requested by the Company. 

   #####

Parent shall promptly (a) forward to the Company copies of all written commitment letters, letters of intent, or other agreements in principle with respect to all debt or equity financing reasonably expected to be obtained in connection with the Offer or the Merger (collectively, the " _Commitments_ "), and (b) advise the Company orally and, if requested by the Company, in writing of (i) any significant change in the status of any such financing arrangements, or (ii) to the knowledge of the Parent, any other event which could reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Offer or the Merger. Parent shall promptly provide Company with copies of any written changes or termination of the Commitments and any written commitments for alternate financing. 

  

 Section 6.12 _Sale of Non-Core Assets_. The Parent and the Purchaser hereby agree that, during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and its representatives shall be entitled to solicit indications of interest from, and to engage in negotiations with, third parties regarding the sale to such third parties of certain non-core assets of the Company and its subsidiaries as may be identified by the Parent from time to time, and the Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, cooperate with the Parent in connection with the foregoing. The Company shall keep Parent informed about all such solicitations and negotiations. Parent shall not represent that it is acting on behalf of the Company in any such solicitations or negotiations.

parties shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts (subject to the

Conditions to the Offer / Cash Merger 

   

 Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or pay for any tendered Shares and, subject to the terms of the Agreement, may extend, terminate, or amend the Offer, and/or Purchaser shall not be required to consummate the Cash Merger, if at any time on or after the date of the Agreement and prior to the time of acceptance for payment or payment for any tendered Shares and/or prior to the Effective Time, any of the following events (each, an " _Event_ ") shall have occurred and be continuing as of the expiration of the Offer (other than as a result of any action or inaction by the Parent or any of its subsidiaries that constitutes a breach of the Agreement): 

  

 (a) there shall have been instituted or be pending any action or proceeding before any Governmental Entity (i) that is reasonably likely to prohibit or materially limit the ownership or operation by the Company or its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, of all or a material portion of the business or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to compel the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Parent to dispose of or hold separate all or a material portion of the business or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent, in each case as a result of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, (ii) that is reasonably likely to impose or confirm material limitations on the ability of Parent or Purchaser to exercise effectively full rights of ownership of any Shares, including the right to vote any Shares acquired by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer on all matters properly presented to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders, (iii) makes illegal, prevents, restrains, or prohibits the making of the Offer, the acceptance for payment of the Shares by Purchaser, or the consummation of the Merger, or (iv) that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; 

   

 (b) there shall have been any judgment, order, injunction, or Law entered into, issued, or adopted by any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction that results in any of the consequences referred to in paragraph (a) above; 

   

 (c) there shall have occurred (i) any general suspension of trading in, or limitation on prices for, securities on the Nasdaq National Market; (ii) a declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension of payments in respect of banks in the United State; (iii) a material limitation by any Governmental Entity on the extension of credit by banks or other lending institutions; (iv) a commencement of war or armed hostilities or other national or international crisis directly involving the United States (other than an action involving United NationsÂ’ personnel or support of United NationsÂ’ personnel); or (v) in the case of any of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) existing at the time of the commencement of the Offer, a material acceleration or worsening thereof; 

   

 (d) the Board, or any committee of the Board, shall have (i) withdrawn or modified (including by amendment of the Schedule 14D-9) in a manner adverse to the Parent or the Purchaser its approval or recommendation of the Offer, the Agreement, or the Merger, (ii) approved or recommended an Acquisition Proposal or any other acquisition of Shares other than the Offer and the Merger, (iii) authorized the Company to enter into an Acquisition Agreement,

   ##### 

  

   

or (iv) resolved to effect any of the actions set forth in any of the
foregoing clauses (i) through (iii); 

   

 (e) any change shall have occurred in the business, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company that has a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and that is in effect as of such time on or after the date of the Agreement; 

   

 (f) except where the failure to be true and correct (without giving effect to any materiality, "Material Adverse Effect," or similar qualifications) could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article IV of the Agreement shall not be true and correct as if such representation or warranty was made as of such time on or after the date of the Agreement (except as to any such representation or warranty which speaks only as of a specific date, which must be untrue or incorrect as of such specific date, it being understood that, for purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations and warranties, any update or modification to the Company Disclosure Schedule made or purported to be made after the date of the Agreement shall be disregarded); 

  

 (g) except as could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, the Company shall have failed to perform in all material respects the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Agreement; 

   

 (h) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms; or 

   

 (i) the applicable waiting period, if any, under the HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated. 

   

 The capitalized terms used in this Annex I shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement to which it is annexed. The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Purchaser and Parent, and may be asserted by Purchaser or Parent regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such condition (other than any circumstances arising solely by any action or inaction by Purchaser or Parent) and may be waived by Purchaser or Parent in whole or in part at any time prior to the expiration of the Offer in their reasonable discretion. The failure by Purchaser or Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right; the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances; and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time prior to the expiration of the Offer.
