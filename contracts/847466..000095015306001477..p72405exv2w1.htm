&#147;<U>DGCL</U>&#148;), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby
each issued and outstanding Share not owned directly or indirectly by the Parent, the Purchaser, or
the Company will be converted into the right to receive the Share Offer Price in cash;

THE OFFER
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1.01 <U>The Offer</U>.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 1%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section
8.01, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, commence (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;<U>Exchange Act</U>&#148;)) the
Offer promptly after the date of this Agreement, but in any event not later than June&nbsp;1, 2006.
The obligation of the Purchaser to accept for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall
be subject only to (i)&nbsp;the condition (the &#147;<U>Minimum Condition</U>&#148;) that at least the number of
Shares that, when added to Shares then owned by Parent and its direct and indirect wholly owned
subsidiaries and affiliates, shall constitute at least ninety percent (90%) of the then
outstanding Shares shall have been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of
the Offer and (ii)&nbsp;the satisfaction or waiver of each of the other conditions set forth in
attached Annex I hereto. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive any such conditions, to
increase the Offer Price, and to make any other changes in the terms of the Offer; provided that
without the prior written consent of the Company, the Purchaser shall not, and Parent shall cause
Purchaser not to, waive the Minimum Condition, extend the Offer except as expressly provided
below, decrease the price per Share or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer,
decrease the number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, impose conditions to the Offer
in addition to those set forth in Annex I, or amend any other term of the Offer in any manner
adverse to the holders of any Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser may, without the
prior consent of the Company, prior to the termination of this Agreement, (x)&nbsp;extend the Offer for
an aggregate period of not more than 10 business days beyond the scheduled expiration date, which
initially shall be 20 business days following the commencement of the Offer (the &#147;<U>Initial
Expiration Date</U>&#148;), if, at any scheduled expiration of the Offer, any of the conditions to
Purchaser&#146;s obligations to accept the Shares for payment shall not be satisfied or waived, (y)
