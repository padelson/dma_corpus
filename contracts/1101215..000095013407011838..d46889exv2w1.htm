Conversion of Securities; Exchange of Certificates

    

 _Section 3.1 __Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or its stockholders, the following shall occur: 

   

 _Section 3.1.1 Conversion Generally_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.1.2, any share of Company Common Stock owned by any Company Subsidiary or by any Subsidiary of Parent other than Merger Sub and any shares of Company Common Stock (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") which are held by stockholders exercising appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ")), shall be converted, subject to Section 3.2.4, into the right to receive $81.75 in cash, payable to the holder thereof, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time 

   ##### 

  

    

represented any such shares shall thereafter represent the right to receive
the Merger Consideration therefor. Certificates previously representing
shares of Company Common Stock (other than any shares of Company Common Stock
to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.1.2) shall be exchanged for the
Merger Consideration, without interest, upon the surrender of such
Certificates in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.2. 

   

 _Section 3.1.2 Cancellation or Conversion of Certain Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock (i) held by Parent, Merger Sub or in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with respect thereto and (ii) held by any Company Subsidiary or any Subsidiary of Parent other than Merger Sub shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Following the Effective Time, each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub common stock shall evidence ownership of an equal number of such shares of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 _Section 3.1.3 Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 _Section 3.1.4 Change in Shares_. If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, solely by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, reverse split, combination or exchange of shares or any other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, reverse split, combination or exchange of shares or any other similar transaction and to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action. 

  

 _Section 3.2 __Exchange of Certificates_. 

   

 _Section 3.2.1 Paying Agent_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article 3, through the Paying Agent, cash in U.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") payable pursuant to Section 3.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to Section 3.1 out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent;  _provided_ , _however_ , that: (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Company 

   ##### 

  

    

Common Stock and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares
of the Company Common Stock in the amount of any such losses to the
extent necessary to pay the Merger Consideration to the holders of Company
Common Stock; and (ii) such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality
thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or
income produced by, such investments shall be payable to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose. 

   

 _Section 3.2.2 Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (but in no event later than three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time), Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") and whose shares of Company Common Stock have been converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1 (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be subject to the consent of the Company prior to the Effective Time, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions (or, if such shares are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such shares on a book-entry account statement (it being understood that any references herein to "Certificates" shall be deemed to include references to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock)), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration or the right to demand to be paid the "fair value" of the shares represented thereby as contemplated by Section 3.3. 

   ##### 

  

   

 _Section 3.2.3 Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. 

   

 _Section 3.2.4 Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article 3 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. 

   

 _Section 3.2.5 No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 _Section 3.2.6 Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Paying Agent will, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, pay the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. 

   

 _Section 3.2.7 No Further Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates. 

   

 _Section 3.2.8 Withholding_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold or cause to be deducted and withheld from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

 _Section 3.3 __Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any Dissenting Stockholder shall demand to be paid the "fair value" of its Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, such Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (except as provided in this Section 3.3) and shall entitle such Dissenting Stockholder only to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless and 

   ##### 

  

    

until such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws (in accordance with Section
262(k) of the DGCL) or effectively loses the right to dissent. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment of
fair value of Dissenting Shares prior to the Effective Time. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice thereof prior to the Effective Time and
Parent shall have the right to participate at its own expense in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. If any
Dissenting Stockholder shall have effectively withdrawn (in accordance with
Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or lost the right to dissent, then as of the
later of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, the
Dissenting Shares held by such Dissenting Stockholder shall be canceled and
converted into and represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 3.1. 

  

 _Section 3.4 __Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed (after giving effect to the items contemplated by this Article 3) and thereafter, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration. 

  

 _Section 3.5 __Company Options and Stock-Based Awards_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action necessary (including any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the Companys Board of Directors or a committee thereof) such that: 

   

 _Section 3.5.1 Company Options_. At the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by Parent and the holder of Company Options with respect to such holders Company Options, each Company Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall become fully vested and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive at the Effective Time an amount in cash in U.S. dollars equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the amount of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded down to the nearest cent. 

   

 _Section 3.5.2 Company Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by Parent and the holder of Company Restricted Stock with respect to such holders Company Restricted Stock, each share of Company Restricted Stock, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior thereto shall become fully vested and all restrictions thereon shall lapse and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive at the Effective Time an amount in cash in U.S. dollars equal to the product of (i) the total number of such shares of Company Restricted Stock and (ii) the Merger Consideration. 

   ##### 

  

   

 _Section 3.5.3 Annual RSUs_. At the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by Parent and the holder of Annual RSUs with respect to such holders Annual RSUs, each award of Annual RSUs that is outstanding immediately prior thereto shall become contingently vested with respect to the number of RSUs (the " _Contingently Vested RSUs_ ") that would have vested in the ordinary course (without regard to any time-based vesting requirement) based on the Companys performance for the applicable performance period through the Effective Time (as determined in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Company Board prior to the Effective Time after making equitable adjustments to exclude the effect of extraordinary or one-time expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) extrapolated to the end of the applicable performance period. Subject to any provision of any agreement between the Company and a holder of an award of Annual RSUs that would accelerate the vesting of Annual RSUs, a holder of an award of Annual RSUs shall become fully vested in the Contingently Vested RSUs (" _Fully Vested RSUs_ ") if the holder is employed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary on February 1, 2008 and the Company shall promptly, but in any event by February 28, 2008, distribute to such holder a lump sum cash payment in U.S. dollars equal to the product of (i) the total number of Fully Vested RSUs subject to such award and (ii) the Merger Consideration. 

   

 _Section 3.5.4 Retention RSUs_. At the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by Parent and the holder of Retention RSUs with respect to such holders Retention RSUs, the performance criteria applicable to each award of Retention RSUs shall be deemed to have been satisfied in full and, subject to any provision of any agreement between the Company and a holder of an award of Retention RSUs that would accelerate the vesting of the Retention RSUs, the RSUs subject to such award of Retention RSUs shall become fully vested if the holder satisfies the time-based vesting criteria thereof (with the applicable vesting dates being deemed to be February 21 of 2008, 2009 and 2010). Promptly after the vesting of any of the RSUs subject to an award of Retention RSUs, but in any event within thirty (30) days of such date, the Company shall distribute to such holder a lump sum cash payment, together with interest thereon at the rate of 8% from the Effective Time, in U.S. dollars equal to the product of (i) the total number of vested RSUs subject to such award of Retention RSUs and (ii) the Merger Consideration. 

   

 _Section 3.5.5 Other RSUs_. At the Effective Time, all RSUs other than Retention RSUs and Annual RSUs shall fully vest (to the extent not already vested) and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive promptly following the Effective Time an amount in cash in U.S. dollars equal to the product of (i) the total number of such RSUs (including any RSUs previously vested without regard to this Section 3.5.3) and (ii) the Merger Consideration. 

   

 _Section 3.5.6 Other Company Stock-Based Awards_. At the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by Parent and the holder of other Company Stock-Based Awards that are not otherwise described in this Section 3.5 with respect to such holders other Company Stock-Based Awards, each other Company Stock-Based Award that is not otherwise described in this Section 3.5, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and, if applicable, unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall 

   ##### 

  

    

become fully vested and shall be converted automatically into the right to
receive at the Effective Time an amount in cash in U.S. dollars equal to the
product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to

For purposes of the NDA, the Company shall be deemed to have consented to the inclusion of all existing or prospective financial advisors, partner sponsors and other sources of debt and equity financing in the term "Representative."

any negotiations or discussions regarding, or furnish or disclose to any
Third Party any information with respect to, any Takeover Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder
Approval, in response to a bona fide Takeover Proposal that was not solicited
in violation of this Section 6.4 and that the Special Committee or the
Company Board determines in good faith (x) after consultation with its
financial advisors, constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to,
a Superior Proposal, and (y) after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the Special
Committee or the Company Board to the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock under applicable Law, the Company shall have the right, subject to
compliance with Section 6.4.2 and acting under the direction of the Special
Committee, to (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal
counsel, advisors, agents and other representatives) pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable
in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the NDA (it being
understood and agreed that such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit

such information has previously been made available to Parent or is made
available to Parent concurrently with or promptly (written 24 hours) after
the time it is provided to such Person) and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its officers,
directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, advisors,

The Company agrees that it will not enter into any confidentiality agreement
with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company
from providing such information to Parent. 

   

 _Section 6.4.2 _Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 6.4 or Section 6.2, at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, if the Company has received a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that was not solicited in violation of this Section 6.4 that the Company Board or the Special Committee concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may (i) withdraw (or not continue to make) or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub the Company Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend or publicly propose to approve or recommend a Superior Proposal (any action described in the foregoing clause (i) or this clause (ii), a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), and/or (iii) enter into an agreement or agreements regarding a Superior Proposal if (x) in the case of an action described in any such clause above, the Special Committee or the Company Board has determined in good faith that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the Special Committee or the Company Board to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock under applicable Law, (y) in the case of an action described in clause (iii) above, (A) the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 6.4 and (B) the Company shall have terminated this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.1(c)(ii) hereof and the Company shall pay Parent the Termination

Fee in accordance with Section 8.4 and (z) in the case of an action described
in any such clause above taken in connection with a Superior Proposal, (a)
the Company has given Parent three (3) Business Days written notice (the "

shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal
(including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal),

of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making such
Superior Proposal, and (b) prior to effecting such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or terminating this Agreement, the Company shall,
and shall cause its legal and financial advisors to, during the
Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the
extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to so negotiate in good faith) to make
such amendments or changes to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Equity Commitment Letter and/or the Guarantee that would cause such Takeover
Proposal to cease to constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event that during
the Notice Period any revisions are made to the Superior Proposal to
which clause (z) above applies and the Company Board or the Special Committee
in its good faith judgment determines such revisions are material (it being
agreed that any change in the purchase price in such Superior Proposal shall
be deemed a material revision), the Company shall promptly notify Parent and
Merger Sub of such revisions to such Superior Proposal and the Notice Period
shall be extended for two additional Business Days. For purposes of the NDA,
the Company shall be deemed to have consented to any proposals made by Parent
or Merger Sub in response to another Takeover Proposal, as contemplated by
this Section 6.4.2. 

   

 _Section 6.4.3 _The Company shall promptly (within 36 hours) advise Parent of the Companys receipt of any Takeover Proposal and shall provide to Parent a copy of such Takeover Proposal made in writing or the material terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal to the extent not made in writing and shall keep Parent apprised of any material developments, discussions and negotiations regarding such Takeover Proposal and upon the reasonable request of Parent shall apprise Parent of the status of such Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (within 24 hours) notify Parent if it determines to begin providing information or engaging in negotiations concerning a Takeover Proposal pursuant to Section 6.4.1.

 _Section 6.4.4 _Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in this Section 6.4 shall prohibit or restrict the Company, the Special Committee or the Company Board from (i) taking and/or disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Special Committee or the Company Board, such disclosure would be reasonably necessary under applicable Law (including Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act);  _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure (other 

   ##### 

  

    

than a "stop, look and listen" letter or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board or the Special
Committee expressly publicly reaffirms its recommendation to its stockholders
in favor of the Merger at least two Business Days prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting if Parent has delivered to the Company a written
request to so reaffirm at least 48 hours (or if 48 hours is impracticable, as
far in advance as is practicable) prior to the time such reaffirmation is to

action, in each case, unless and until (a) all of the conditions set forth in

The Parties agree that consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed to be a "change in control" for purposes of all Company Benefit Plans and other compensation arrangements with respect to which such concept is relevant. Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of employment for any Continuing Employee, or to restrict the right of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee.

extraordinary or one-time expenses incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. At the Effective Time, except as
otherwise agreed by Parent and the holder of a Retention Award with respect
to such holders Retention Award, the performance criteria applicable to each
Retention Award shall be deemed to have been satisfied in full and, subject
to any provision of any agreement between the Company and a holder of an
award of Retention Award that would accelerate the vesting of the Retention
Award, the Retention Award shall vest to the extent the holder satisfies the
time-based vesting criteria thereof. Promptly after the vesting of any
portion of the Retention Award, but in any event within thirty (30) days of
such date, the Company shall distribute in U.S. dollars to the holder of a
Retention Award the portion of such award that has so vested. For purposes
hereof, " _Retention Award_ " means the cash-based awards described in

Corporation be required to expend for such extension pursuant to this

Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as

period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the DandO

or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant
to this sentence an amount in excess of the amount set forth in Section 6.9.2

   ##### 

  

    

satisfying on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger
Sub to obtaining the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters
(including by consummating the financing contemplated by the Equity
Commitment Letter), negotiating definitive agreements with respect to the
Debt Commitment Letter on terms and conditions contained therein or
with respect to any replacement commitments, satisfying on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in such definitive agreements
that are within its control and, if necessary, borrowing pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letters in the event any "flex" provisions are exercised). Parent
shall keep the Company informed on a current basis in reasonable detail of
the status of its efforts to comply with the terms of, and satisfy the
conditions contemplated by, the financing contemplated by the Commitments
in accordance with this Section 6.14. In furtherance of the provisions of
this Section 6.14 but subject to Section 6.14.2, one or more Debt Commitment
Letters may be amended or superseded without the prior consent of the Company
to replace or add one or more lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities which had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letters as of the date hereof, or otherwise, _provided_ that in no
event shall any Debt Commitment Letters be amended or superseded in a manner
that would (i) expand or adversely amend the conditions to the debt financing
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters; (ii) reasonably be expected to
delay or prevent the Closing; (iii) reduce the aggregate amount of debt
financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters (unless, in the case of
this clause (iii), replaced with an amount of new equity financing on terms no
less favorable to Parent than the terms set forth in the Equity Commitment
Letter); or (iv) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
enforce their rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment
Letters. In such event, the term " _Debt Commitment Letters_ " as used herein
shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters that are not so
amended or superseded at the time in question and any such amendment to
or replacement of the Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect.
In the event that all conditions to the Commitments (other than in connection
with the Debt Commitment Letters, the availability or funding pursuant to the
Equity Commitment Letter) have been satisfied in Parents good faith
judgment, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders
and other persons providing the Commitments to fund on the Closing
Date. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by
any party of the Commitments, any termination of any of the Commitments or
any other circumstance, event or condition that would reasonably be likely to
prevent or materially impede or delay the consummation of the financing
contemplated by the Commitments, to the extent it becomes aware of such
breach, termination, circumstance, event or condition. If any portion of
the financing contemplated by the Commitments becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) set forth in the
Commitment Letters, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on terms no less
favorable to Parent or Merger Sub (as determined in the reasonable judgment of
Parent) than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters (including the
flex provisions) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event, but in no event later than the last day of the Marketing Period. For
the avoidance of doubt, (i) the obtaining of the financing provided for by
the Commitments, or any alternative 

   ##### 

  

    

financing, is not a condition to Closing and (ii) in the event that (x) all
or any portion of the financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters
structured as privately offered notes is not yet received by Parent or Merger
Sub, (y) the conditions to closing in Article 7 (other than the delivery
of the officers certificates contemplated in Sections 7.2.3 and 7.3.3 and
conditions that by their nature can be satisfied only at Closing) have been
satisfied and (z) the bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters (or alternative bridge financing obtained in accordance with this
Agreement) are available in all material respects on the terms and conditions
(including the flex provisions) described in the Debt Commitment Letters (or
alternative financing therefor), then Parent shall cause the proceeds of
such bridge financing or alternative financing) to be used to replace such
privately offered note financing no later than the final day of the Marketing
Period. For purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise agreed among the
parties hereto, " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean the first period of twenty
(20) consecutive Business Days after the date hereof (A) during which (1)
Parent shall have the Required Information that the Company is required to
provide to Parent pursuant to Section 6.15 and (2) no event has occurred and
no conditions exist that would cause any of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2 to fail to be satisfied assuming the Closing were to be scheduled
for any time during such 20-consecutive-Business-Day period, and (B) the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 have been satisfied (other than
conditions that by their nature can be satisfied only at the Closing);
_provided_ that if the Marketing Period would not end on or prior to August
17, 2007, the Marketing Period shall commence no earlier than September 4,
2007; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if the Marketing Period would not end on
or prior to December 20, 2007, the Marketing Period shall commence no earlier
than January 2, 2008; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Marketing Period
shall not be deemed to have commenced if, (i) after the date hereof and prior
to the completion of the Marketing Period, Deloitte and Touche LLP shall have
withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any of the financial statements
contained in the Company SEC Filings or (ii) if the financial statements
included in the Required Information that is available to Parent on the first
day of any such 20-consecutive-Business Day period would not be sufficiently
current on any day during such 20-consecutive-Business-Day period to permit a
registration statement using such financial statements to be declared
effective by the SEC on the last day of the 20-consecutive-Business-Day
period. 

   

 _Section 6.14.2 _In no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or any member of the Parent Group (i) retain any financial advisors on an exclusive basis other than financial advisors to which the Special Committee consents or (ii) enter into any contract or agreement with any bank or investment bank or other potential provider of debt financing on an exclusive basis (or otherwise on terms that would prohibit such Persons from providing (or seeking to provide) such debt financing to any other Persons in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, in each case in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby). 

  

 _Section 6.15 __Cooperation in Securing Financing_. From the date of this Agreement until Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary and each of the respective officers and employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the advisors, including legal and accounting, of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to provide all

need not be issued by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries; and _provided_
, _further_ , that any private placement memoranda or prospectuses shall
contain disclosure and financial statements reflecting the Surviving
Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor), (iii) executing and
delivering any pledge and security documents, currency or interest hedging
arrangements or other definitive financing documents or other certificates,
legal opinions and documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent or
otherwise facilitating the pledging of collateral as may be reasonably
requested by Parent ( _provided_ that any obligations contained in such
documents shall be effective no earlier than as of the Effective Time), (iv)
furnishing Parent and Merger Sub and their financing sources as promptly as
practicable with financial and other pertinent information regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent,
including all financial statements and financial and other data of the type
required by Regulation S-X (other than Item 3-10 of Regulation S-X, but
including summary guarantor/non-guarantor information of the type customarily
included in offering documents used in private placements under Rule 144A of
the Securities Act) and Regulation S-K, including audits thereto to the
extent so required, under the Securities Act and of the type and form
customarily included in offering documents used in private placements under
Rule 144A of the Securities Act to consummate the offerings of debt
securities contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters at the time during the
Companys fiscal year such offerings will be made (information required to be
delivered pursuant to this clause (iv) being referred to as, the " _Required
Information_ "), _provided_  that Parent will provide the Company with a list
of the form and types of financial and other information it will request
pursuant to this clause (iv) as promptly as practicable after the date of
this Agreement, (v) using reasonable best efforts to obtain accountants
comfort letters, accountants consents, legal opinions, surveys and title

efforts to (A) permit the lenders under the Debt Commitment Letters to

management and accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto
for the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements ( _provided_ that
such access and information shall only be provided to the extent that in the
judgment of the Company such access or the provision of such information
would not violate applicable Law; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
foregoing shall not require the Company to permit any inspection, or to
disclose any information, that in the judgment of the Company would result in
the disclosure of any trade secrets or violate any of its or the Company
Subsidiaries obligations with respect to confidentiality) and (B) establish
bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box
arrangements in connection with the foregoing ( _provided_ that
such accounts, agreements and arrangements will not become active or take

contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters; _provided_ that neither the

any agreement or commit to take any action that is not contingent upon the
Closing (including the entry into any purchase agreement). Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to pay any commitment or
other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with the
financing contemplated by the Commitments prior to the Effective Time.
Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. Parent and Merger
Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the

 Termination, Amendment and Waiver  

  

 _Section 8.1 __Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Merger contemplated hereby may be abandoned, at any time prior to the Effective Time, by action taken or authorized by the Board of Directors of the terminating Party or Parties, whether before or after the Stockholder Approval:

 (b) by either Parent or the Company (if, in the case of the Company, it has not materially violated Section 6.4 and upon the approval of the Special Committee)): 

   

 (i) if the Stockholder Approval is not obtained at the Company Stockholders Meeting or any adjournment thereof at which this Agreement has been voted upon; 

   

 (ii) if the Merger shall not have been consummated by 11:59 p.m. New York City time on the date that is eleven (11) months from the date hereof (such date, the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ that if the Marketing Period has commenced on or before the Termination Date but has not ended on or before the Termination Date, the Termination Date shall automatically be extended by one month; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any Party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to occur on or before the Termination Date; or 

   

 (iii) if there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or any Order of any Governmental Entity having competent jurisdiction is entered enjoining the Company, Parent or Merger Sub from consummating the Merger and such Order has become final and non-appealable and, prior to termination pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(iii) each of the Parties shall have used its reasonable best efforts to resist, appeal, obtain consent under, resolve or lift, as applicable, the Law or Order and shall have complied in all material respects with its obligations under Section 6.5; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(iii) shall not be available to any Party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement results in the imposition of any such Order or the failure of such Order to be resisted, resolved or lifted, as applicable. 

   

 (c) by the Company (upon the approval of the Special Committee): 

   

 (i) if (x) Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached any of the covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement to be complied with by Parent or Merger Sub such that the closing condition set forth in Section 7.3.2 would not be satisfied, (y) there exists a breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement such that the closing condition set forth in Section 7.3.1 would not be satisfied or (z) if all the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and 7.2 are satisfied (excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but which would be reasonably capable of being satisfied at Closing) and Parent or Merger Sub fails to effect the Merger and/or satisfy their respective obligations under Section 3, including depositing (or causing to be deposited) with the Paying Agent sufficient funds to make all payments pursuant to Section 3.1 by 11:59 p.m. New York City time on the final day of the Marketing Period, and, in the case of (x) or (y), such breach is incapable of being cured by the Termination Date or is not cured within thirty (30) Business Days after Parent or Merger Sub receives written notice of 

   ##### 

  

    

such breach from the Company;  _provided_ that the Company shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)(i) if, at
the time of such termination, there exists a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement
that would result in the closing conditions set forth in Sections 7.2.1 or
7.2.2, as applicable, not being satisfied; or 

   

 (ii) if prior to the obtaining of the Stockholder Approval (w) the Company has received a Superior Proposal, (x) the Special Committee or the Company Board determines in good faith that the failure to terminate this Agreement would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the Special Committee or the Company Board to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock under applicable Law, (y) the Company has complied in all material respects with Section 6.4 and (z) not later than the day of such termination, the Company pays the Termination Fee to Parent in accordance with Section 8.4.

 (ii) if, prior to the obtaining of the Stockholder Approval (x) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred, (y) the Company has failed to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (z) the Company Board or Special Committee approves or recommends a Takeover Proposal to the holders of Company Common Stock or approves or recommends that holders of Company Common Stock tender their shares of Company Common Stock in any tender offer or exchange offer that is a Takeover Proposal.

   ##### 

  

    

officers or directors; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of
Section 6.5 (third and fourth sentences thereof), Section 6.16.3 (first and
third sentences thereof), Section 6.16.6, this Section 8.2, Sections 8.3,
8.4, 8.5 and Article 9 and the NDA shall remain in full force and effect and
survive any termination of this Agreement;  _provided_ , _further_ , that no
Party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising
out of its willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement. In
no event shall any Party be liable for punitive damages. 

  

 _Section 8.3 __Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated. 

  

 _Section 8.4 __Termination Fee_. 

   

 _Section 8.4.1 _In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) or Section 8.1(d)(ii), then the Company shall pay Parent (or Parents designee) $170,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") not later than the day of such termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i), 8.1(b)(ii) or Section 8.1(d)(i) (if, in the case of termination pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i), at the time of such termination there is no state of facts or circumstances (other than a state of facts or circumstances caused by a breach of the Companys representations and warranties or covenants and other agreements hereunder) that would cause the conditions in Sections 7.1.2, 7.1.3 and 7.3 not to be satisfied on or prior to the Termination Date), then, in the event that, (i) after the date hereof and prior to such termination, or, in the case of a termination under Section 8.1(b)(i), after the date hereof and prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any Third Party shall have publicly made, proposed, communicated or disclosed an intention to make a bona fide Takeover Proposal, which bona fide Takeover Proposal has not been publicly retracted or rescinded by the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting and (ii) within twelve (12) months of the termination of this Agreement the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal (with all percentages in the definition of Takeover Proposal increased to fifty (50) percent) (whether or not the same as the Takeover Proposal originally made or publicly announced) or any Takeover Proposal is consummated (with all percentages in the definition of Takeover Proposal increased to fifty (50) percent) (whether or not the same as the Takeover Proposal originally made or publicly announced), then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid to, Parent (or Parents designee) the Termination Fee, less the amount of any Parent Expenses previously paid, upon the earlier of the entering into of such definitive agreement or the consummation of such Takeover Proposal. The Termination Fee shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing to the Company by Parent (or Parents designee). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay, or cause to paid, the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. 

   

 _Section 8.4.2 _In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) under circumstances in which the Termination Fee is not then payable pursuant to Section 8.4.1, then the Company shall pay promptly (but in any event within two Business Days) following receipt of an invoice therefor all of Parents actual and 

   ##### 

  

    

reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable
legal fees and expenses) actually incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on or
prior to the termination of this Agreement in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Parent Expenses_ "), which
amount shall not be greater than $20,000,000; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the existence of circumstances which could require the Termination Fee
to become subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to Section 8.4.1 shall
not relieve the Company of its obligations to pay the Parent Expenses
pursuant to this Section 8.4.2; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that the
payment by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.4.2
shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay
the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.4.1 except to the extent indicated
in Section 8.4.1. 

   

 _Section 8.4.3 _The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.4 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, that the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Termination Fee are payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and that the amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.4.1 are not a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub in the circumstances in which such Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the Termination Fee and, in order to obtain such payments Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such suit. 

  

 _Section 8.5 __Business Interruption Fee_. 

   

 _Section 8.5.1 _In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i), if, at the time of such termination, there is no state of facts or circumstances (other than a state of facts or circumstances caused by a breach of Parents or Merger Subs representations and warranties or covenants and other agreements hereunder) that would cause the conditions in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 not to be satisfied on or prior to the Termination Date, then Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company a business interruption fee in an aggregate amount of $170,000,000 (the " _Business Interruption Fee_ "). The Business Interruption Fee shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by the Company in writing to Parent on the second Business Day following termination of this Agreement by the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be obligated to pay, or cause to paid, the Business Interruption Fee on more than one occasion. 

   

 _Section 8.5.2 _Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, that the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Business Interruption Fee are payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and that amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.5.1 are not a penalty, but 

   ##### 

  

    

rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate the Company in the circumstances in which the Business
Interruption Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and that, without these agreements, the
Company would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Parent fails to
promptly pay the Business Interruption Fee and, in order to obtain such
payment the company commences a suit which results in a judgment against
Parent for the Business Interruption Fee, Parent shall pay to the Company its
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with
such suit. 

   

 _Section 8.5.3 _Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the Companys right to receive payment of the Business Interruption Fee from Parent pursuant to Section 8.5.1 and the reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent under Section 6.15 (the third and fourth sentences thereof), Section 6.16.3 (first and third sentences thereof) and Section 6.16.6 or the guarantee thereof pursuant to the Guarantee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (it being understood that no other Person (including the Fund) shall have any liability or obligation under or with respect to such provisions) and (ii) in no event, whether or not this Agreement shall have been terminated, shall the Company be entitled to monetary damages in excess of (x) $3,000,000 with respect to the reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent under Section 6.15 (the third and fourth sentences thereof), Section 6.16.3 (first and third sentences thereof) and Section 6.16.6 and (y) $170,000,000, in the aggregate, inclusive of the Business Interruption Fee, if applicable, for all other losses and damages arising from or in connection with breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or otherwise relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 _Section 8.6 __Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and, in the case of the Company upon the approval of the Special Committee, subject to Section 8.7, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that after any approval of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders, there may not be any extension or waiver of this Agreement which decreases the Merger Consideration or which adversely affects the rights of the Companys stockholders hereunder without the approval of such stockholders. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. 

  

 _Section 8.7 __Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may only take such action with the approval of the Special Committee; and _provided_ , _further_ , that after approval of the Agreement 

   ##### 

  

    

by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment that, by Law or in
accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further
approval by such stockholders may be made without further stockholder
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by Parent and the Company.

 _Section 9.4 __Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the greatest extent possible. 

  

 _Section 9.5 __Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, Parent Disclosure Schedule, Company Disclosure Schedule and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto), the Commitments and the NDA constitute the entire agreement of the Parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the Parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NONE OF PARENT, MERGER SUB 

   ##### 

  

    

AND THE COMPANY MAKES ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, AND EACH
HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES MADE BY ITSELF OR
ANY OF ITS RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, FINANCIAL AND
LEGAL ADVISORS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO THE EXECUTION AND
DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE MERGER, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY
OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY
DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE
FOREGOING. Each Party hereby agrees that their respective representations,
warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the
other parties hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this
Agreement, and this Agreement, except for the provisions of Section 6.9, is
not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the Parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
accuracy or completeness of the representations and warranties set forth
herein. 

  

 _Section 9.6 __Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Parties _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Companys stockholders, Parent and Merger Subsidiary may assign this Agreement (in whole but not in part) to Parent or any of its Affiliates ( _provided_ that such assignment shall not (i) affect the obligations of the Fund under the Equity Commitment Letter or Guarantee or (ii) impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise materially impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement). No assignment by any Party shall relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 _Section 9.7 __Mutual Drafting_. Each Party has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each Party acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the Parties. 

  

 _Section 9.8 __Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury; Remedies_. 

   

 _Section 9.8.1 _This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law principles that would result in the application of any Laws other than the Laws of the State of Delaware. 

   

 _Section 9.8.2 _The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled pursuant to the 

   ##### 

  

    

terms of this Agreement, at law or in equity. Notwithstanding the first
sentence of this Section 9.8.2, however, the Parties acknowledge that the
Company shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement only to prevent breaches of or enforce
compliance with those covenants of Parent or Merger Sub that require Parent
or Merger Sub to (x) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the financing
contemplated by the Commitments, including without limitation, the covenants
set forth in Section 6.5 (Reasonable Best Efforts) and Section 6.14
(Financing) and (y) consummate the Merger, if in the case of clause (y),
the financing provided for in the Commitments (and, if alternative financing
is being used, pursuant to commitments with respect thereto) is available to
be drawn down by Parent pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreements
but is not so drawn solely as a result of Parent refusing to do so in breach
of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, whether or not the Company is
entitled to seek injunctions or specific performance pursuant to
the provisions of the preceding sentence or otherwise, in no event will the
Company be entitled to seek monetary damages in excess of (i) $3,000,000 with
respect to the reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent under

out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be brought solely in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware;

subject matter jurisdiction over any such legal action, suit or proceeding,
such legal action, suit or proceeding shall be brought in the Federal courts

, that if (and only after) both the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware

action, suit or proceeding, such legal action, suit or proceeding shall be
brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New

hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such action,
suit or proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to the
jurisdiction of such courts, that the action, suit or proceeding is brought
in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action, suit or proceeding is
improper or that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may
not be enforced in or by such courts. Each Party agrees that notice or the
service of process in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
