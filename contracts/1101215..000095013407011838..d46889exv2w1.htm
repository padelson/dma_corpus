acknowledge that the Company shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement only to prevent breaches of or enforce compliance with those
covenants of Parent or Merger Sub that require Parent or Merger Sub to (x)&nbsp;use its

financing provided for in the Commitments (and, if alternative financing is being used,

Parent refusing to do so in breach of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, whether

provisions of the preceding sentence or otherwise, in no event will the Company be entitled
to seek monetary damages in excess of (i) $3,000,000 with respect to the reimbursement and
indemnification obligations of Parent under Section&nbsp;6.15 (the third and fourth sentences
thereof), Section&nbsp;6.16.3 (first and third sentences thereof) and Section&nbsp;6.16.6 and (ii)

Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Representative or otherwise relating to or

action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought solely in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware;
