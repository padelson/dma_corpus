 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

  



  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " **Agreement** ") is made and entered
into as of January 6, 2006, by and among Coast Acquisition Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (" **Parent** "), Coast Merger Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" **Merger Sub** ")
and Water Pik Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " **Company**
").

  



  

 **RECITALS**

  



  

A. The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have deemed it advisable and in the best interests of their respective
corporations and stockholders to consummate the Merger (as defined in Section
1.1), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

B. The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

  



  

 **ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER**

  



  

 **1.1** ** _The Merger_**. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section
1.2) and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (" **Delaware Law** "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company (the " **Merger** "), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation.
 The Company, as the surviving corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter
sometimes referred to as the " **Surviving Corporation**."

  



  

 **1.2** ** _Effective Time; Closing_**. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing a Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the "
**Certificate of Merger** ") (the time of such filing with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware (or such later time as may be agreed in
writing by the Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger)
being the " **Effective Time** ") as soon as practicable on the Closing Date
(as defined below). The closing of the Merger (the " **Closing** ") shall take
place at the offices of OMelveny and Myers LLP, 610 Newport Center Drive, 17th
Floor, Newport Beach, California, at a time and date to be specified by the
parties, which shall be no later than the later of (a) the second business
day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
VI and (b) April 26, 2006, or at such other time, date and location as the
parties hereto agree in writing (the date on which the closing actually
occurs, the " **Closing Date** ").

  



  

1   

     
   

  



  

 **1.3** ** _Effect of the Merger_**. At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of Delaware Law.

  



  

 **1.4** ** _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_**. At the Effective
Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended to
read in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit A_. At the Effective Time, the
Bylaws of the Company shall be amended to read in their entirety as set forth
in _Exhibit B_.

  



  

 **1.5** ** _Directors and Officers_**. The initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified.  The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time,
until their respective successors are duly appointed.

  



  

 **1.6** ** _Effect on Capital Stock_**. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company, the following
shall occur:

  



  

(a) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of the Common Stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company (" **Company Common Stock** ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of
Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(b) and any
Dissenting Shares) will be canceled and extinguished and automatically
converted into the right to receive $27.75 per share in cash (the " **Merger
Consideration** ").

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury and Parent Owned Stock_. Each share of Company
Common Stock held by the Company or Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof.

  



  

(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value
$.01, of Merger Sub (the " **Merger Sub Common Stock** ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(d) _Employee Stock Options; Restricted Stock; Deferred Stock Units_.

  



  

(i) Except as provided for in Section 1.6(d)(ii), each Company Option (as
defined in Section 2.2(b)) which is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder thereof, be converted into and shall become a right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, with respect to each share
subject thereto, equal to the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the per share exercise or purchase price of such Company Option (such
amount being hereinafter referred to as the " **Option Merger Consideration**
") and each

  



  

2   

     
   

  



  

Company Option shall be canceled at the Effective Time. The payment of the
Option Merger Consideration to the holder of a Company Option shall be
reduced by any income or employment tax withholding required under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " **Code** ") or any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax (as defined in Section 2.6) law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of such Company
Option.  The Company Stock Plans (as defined in Section 2.2 (b))
shall terminate at the Effective Time.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.6(d)(i) that provide for the
cancellation of the unexercised Company Options, Parent, in its sole
discretion, may permit the holders of certain Company Options to elect, after
the date hereof and before the Closing Date and on a form and in a manner
reasonably acceptable to each of Parent and the Company, to exchange their
outstanding Company Options and receive substituted options to purchase
common stock of Parent. Parent intends that the exchange and substitution of
the Company Options for new options shall be effected in a manner, including
but not limited to adjustments to the exercise price of the new options, that
satisfies the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the requirements
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.424-1 to the extent that such requirements
can be satisfied in light of the intended terms of the new options; provided,
however, that none of the Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall have any
liability to the optionee or any other person in the event that such
requirements are not satisfied.

  



  

(iii) Each Deferred Stock Unit (as defined in Section 2.2(b) hereof) which
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holder thereof, be converted into and shall become a right
to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration. Each
Performance Share (as defined in Section 2.2(b) hereof) which the Company
has, subject to certain specified criteria being satisfied, agreed to issue
but not yet issued immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holder thereof, be converted into and shall become a right
to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is subject to restrictions on ownership or
transferability shall vest in full and become fully transferable and free of
restrictions not later than immediately prior to the Effective Time. To the
extent any holder of an award referenced in this Section 1.6(d)(iii) has made
a deferred payment election prior to the date hereof in accordance with the
terms of the applicable Company Plan with respect to any such award, any
payment with respect to that award shall be made in accordance with the terms
of such deferred payment election. The Company agrees to take any and all
commercially reasonable actions necessary (including any action reasonably
requested in writing by Parent) to effectuate the transactions contemplated
by this Section 1.6(d).

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

(e) _Adjustments to the Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration
shall be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution
of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to
Company Common Stock having a record date on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time, so that recipients of the Merger Consideration
receive the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event.

  



  

 **1.7** ** _Surrender of Certificates_**.

  



  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a
bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as the
exchange agent (the " **Exchange Agent** ") in the Merger. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with Exchange Agent,
which shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

  



  

(b) _Parent to Provide Cash_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Exchange Agent
for exchange in accordance with this Article I, cash payable to the
stockholders of the Company pursuant to Section 1.6(a) in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. Any funds deposited with the
Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " **Exchange Fund**."

  



  

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than five (5) business days following the Effective Time), Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the
Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the " **Certificates**
") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to
receive cash pursuant to Section 1.6(a): (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration to
which the holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6(a)
(without limiting the effect of Section 1.7(e)). Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive promptly (and in no event later than five (5) business
days after receipt thereof) in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration to
which the holder of such certificate is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6(a)
(less any withholding amount with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly held by such holder as provided by Section 1.7(e)), and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.  No interest shall
accrue or be paid on the amounts payable pursuant to this Article I upon
surrender of the Certificates.

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. If the payment of the amounts payable
pursuant to Section 1.6(a) is to be made to a person other than the person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate formerly evidencing shares of Company
Common Stock are registered, it will be a condition of payment that the
Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the Persons (as defined in Section 8.3(d))
requesting such payment will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by
it any transfer or other Taxes (as defined in Section 2.6) required by reason
of the payment of the amount specified in Section 1.6(a) to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or established to
the reasonable satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such
Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Exchange Agent and the Parent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of
Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement (as defined
in Section 2.2(d)). To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld,
the amount of such consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would
otherwise have been paid.

  



  

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 1.7, neither the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation nor any
party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock
for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  



  

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis; provided that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of

or holders in Section 262 of Delaware Law.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to

such event, such holders shares shall no longer be deemed to be "Dissenting
Shares" and such shares shall automatically be converted into and represent

 **ARTICLE V 
 AGREEMENTS**

  



  

 **5.1** ** _Proxy Statement_**. Promptly after execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and shall file with the SEC as soon
as is reasonably practicable a preliminary Proxy Statement, together with a
form of proxy, with respect to the Stockholders Meeting at which the
stockholders of the Company will be asked to vote upon the adoption of this
Agreement and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Proxy
Statement and form of proxy cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable,
and promptly thereafter shall mail the definitive Proxy Statement and form of
proxy to stockholders of the Company. The term " **Proxy Statement** " shall
mean such proxy or information statement and all amendments or supplements
thereto, if any, similarly filed and mailed. Parent will provide the Company
with any information with respect to Parent, Merger Sub, Parents business or
the Financings or any alternative financing arrangement that may be required
in order to effectuate the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement
pursuant to this Section 5.1. The Company will provide Parent and its
counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy
Statement prior to its filing and will incorporate such comments that the
Company determines are reasonable. The Company will respond to, and
provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to participate
in the response of the Company to, any comments from the SEC and will notify
Parent promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC in connection
with the filing of, or amendments or supplements to, the Proxy Statement.
Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, will promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing
with the SEC and/or mailing to stockholders of the Company such amendment or
supplement.  Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and the Company
shall provide Parent (and its counsel) with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Proxy Statement and on any amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement prior to filing such with the SEC.  Parent will
furnish the Company with such supplemental information as may be necessary in
order to cause the Proxy Statement, insofar as it relates to Parent and its
Subsidiaries, to comply with applicable law after the mailing thereof to the
stockholders of the Company. The Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in
all material respects with all applicable requirements of federal securities
laws.

  



  

 **5.2** ** _Meetings of Stockholders; Board Recommendation_**.

  



  

(a) _Meeting of Stockholders_. Promptly after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company will take all action necessary in accordance with
Delaware Law and its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to call, hold
and convene a meeting of its stockholders to consider the adoption of this
Agreement (the " **Stockholders  Meeting**") as soon as practicable after
the date hereof. Except in any case where the Recommendation has been
withdrawn in accordance with Sections 5.3(c), 5.3(d) or 5.3(e)(ii), the
Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, and will
take all other

  



  

35   

     
   

  



  

action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its
stockholders required by Delaware Law to obtain such approval. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn
or postpone its Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that
any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to
its stockholders in advance of a vote on this Agreement or, if as of the time
for which the Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in
the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
the business of such Stockholders Meeting.

  



  

(b) _Board Recommendation_. Except to the extent expressly permitted by
Sections 5.3(c), 5.3(d) or 5.3(e)(ii): (i) the Board of Directors of
the Company shall recommend that its stockholders vote in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement (the " **Recommendation** "), at the
Stockholders Meeting, (ii) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to
the effect that the Board of Directors of the Company has recommended that
the Companys stockholders vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the
Stockholders Meeting, and (iii) neither the Board of Directors of the
Company nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose
or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Recommendation.

  



  

 **5.3** ** _Acquisition Proposals_**.

  



  

(a) _No Solicitation of Transactions_. From the date of this Agreement
until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with Article VII, except as otherwise permitted hereby, the
Company will not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its officers and
directors to, and it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its agents, affiliates, employees and advisors not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including, but not
limited to, by way of furnishing nonpublic information) any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer (including, without limitation, any proposal
or offer to its stockholders) that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to
lead to, any Competing Transaction (as defined below), (ii) enter into or
maintain or continue negotiations with any person in furtherance of such
inquiries or to obtain a Competing Transaction, (iii) agree to any Competing
Transaction or (iv) endorse any Competing Transaction or any agreement or
understanding relating to a Competing Transaction or (v) take any action to
exempt any person from the restrictions on business combinations contained in
Section 203 of Delaware Law; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, prior to the adoption of this Agreement by
the Companys stockholders, nothing in this Section 5.3 shall in any respect
prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company or the officers, directors,
agents, affiliates, employees or advisors of the Company or its Subsidiaries
from furnishing or disclosing information to, or engaging in discussions or
negotiations with, any person or entity that makes an unsolicited bona fide
written proposal to acquire the Company pursuant to a Competing Transaction
(a " **Competing Transaction Proposal** "), if the Board of Directors of the
Company acting in good faith determines after consultation with the Companys
financial and legal advisors that such proposal constitutes or is reasonably
likely to result in a Superior

  



  

36   

     
   

  



  

Proposal (as defined below), and that the failure to take such action is
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations under
applicable law. The Company will not modify, waive, amend or release any
standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement entered into prior to the
date hereof or any standstill or confidentiality agreement entered into by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries between the date hereof and Effective
Time, and the Company will enforce the provisions of any such standstill and
confidentiality agreement unless, in the case of any standstill agreement,
(x) the Company has complied with this Section 5.3(a), (y) the party to such
standstill agreement, on an unsolicited basis, submits or modifies a
Competing Proposal such that it constitutes or is reasonably likely to result
in a Superior Proposal, and (z) the Company thereafter complies with Section
5.3(b).

  



  

(b) _Notification of Unsolicited Acquisition Proposals_. The Company shall
promptly (within 24 hours) notify Parent after receipt by the Company (or any
of its officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors or other
representatives) of any Competing Transaction Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information or inquiry which it reasonably believes could be
expected to lead to a Competing Transaction Proposal and shall provide to
Parent, orally and in writing, the terms and conditions of any such Competing
Transaction Proposal, or such request or inquiry and the identity of the
person making the same, and a copy of all written materials provided to the
Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with any such Competing Transaction
Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall notify Parent (within 24 hours) orally
and in writing of any material modifications to the financial or other
material terms of such Competing Transaction Proposal or inquiry and shall
provide to Parent, within the same timeframe, a copy of all written materials
subsequently provided to or by the Company or any Subsidiary in connection
with any such Competing Transaction Proposal. Prior to the Company furnishing
information with respect to the Company, as permitted by Section 5.3(a), to
any person making such a Competing Transaction Proposal, the Company shall
enter into a confidentiality agreement with such person the terms of which
with respect to the protection of confidential information are substantially
equivalent to or more protective of the Company than the Confidentiality
Agreement (as defined below), provided that all such information (to the
extent such information has not been provided to Parent) is provided or made
available to Parent at such time such information is made available to such
person. The Company shall provide Parent with a correct and complete copy of
any confidentiality agreement entered into pursuant to this paragraph within
24 hours of the execution thereof.

  



  

(c) _Changes of Recommendation_. Neither the Board of Directors of the
Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw (or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent), once made, its recommendation in favor of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby or approve or recommend a Competing
Transaction Proposal (any action described in this subsection being referred
to as a (" **Company Adverse Recommendation Change** ")) or (ii) approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company
or any subsidiary thereof to execute, or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement or
other business combination or acquisition agreement, joint venture agreement
or other agreement constituting or relating to a Competing Transaction

  



  

37   

     
   

  



  

Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement related thereto).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Board of
Directors of the Company may, prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the
Companys stockholders, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
connection with a bona fide written Superior Proposal made (or in the case of
any proposal with respect to a Competing Transaction made prior to the date
hereof, modified) that did not result from a breach of Section 5.3 hereof if
the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consulting with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure of the Board of Directors to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change is reasonably likely to result in a
breach of its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable law; provided, that no Company Adverse Recommendation Change may
be made in connection with a Superior Proposal until the third business day
following Parents receipt from the Company of (x) a notice that the Board of
Directors of the Company has determined that such Competing Transaction
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that it intends to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (y) the terms and conditions of any
offer or proposal in respect to the Superior Proposal. In
determining whether to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors shall take into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement or the Merger proposed by
Parent (in response to a notice) in determining whether such proposal shall
constitute a Superior Proposal.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding Section 5.3(a), the Board of Directors of the Company
may, prior the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders but
only in response to a Competing Transaction Proposal, terminate this
Agreement to enter into an agreement with respect to such Competing
Transaction Proposal, but only if:

  



  

(i) such Competing Transaction Proposal did not result from a breach by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of this Section 5.3;

  



  

(ii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have first provided prior
written notice to Parent that it is prepared to terminate this Agreement to
enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice
shall attach the most current version of any written agreement relating to
the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal, the identity of the
party making such Superior Proposal and any other material terms and
conditions thereof;

  



  

(iii) Parent does not make, during the three business days following Parents
receipt from the Company of a notice that the Board of Directors of the
Company has determined that such Competing Transaction Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and that it intends to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change (it being understood and agreed that any change to the
financial or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a
new notice to Parent and a new three day business period), a binding, written
proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisor, causes the
Competing Transaction Proposal that constituted a Superior

  



  

38   

     
   

  



  

Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal and which, by its terms,
may be accepted at any time within such three business day period (or such
subsequent three business day period, as the case may be); and

  



  

(iv) in the event of any termination of this Agreement by the Company
pursuant to this paragraph, the Company pays the termination fee under
Section 7.3 concurrently with and as a condition of such termination.

  



  

The Company agrees that, during the period of three business days prior to
terminating this Agreement to enter into an agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal (and any subsequent three business day period pursuant to
the parenthetical in clause (iii) above), the Board of Directors of the
Company shall consider and negotiate in good faith any revisions to the terms
of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement that are proposed by
Parent.

  



  

(e) _Compliance with Tender Offer Rules_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall be permitted to disclose to
the stockholders of the Company a position with respect to a Competing
Transaction Proposal required by Rule 14e-2(a), Item 1012(a) of Regulation
M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (ii) the Board of
Directors of the Company may withdraw, modify or amend the recommendation of
the Merger and this Agreement by the Board of Directors of the Company or
disclose any other information to the stockholders of the Company at any time
if, in each case, it determines, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action is reasonably likely to result
in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable law.

  



  

(f) _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, the following
terms shall have the following meanings:

dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company, in each case other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

they deem relevant, to be more favorable to the holders of the Company Common
Stock than those contemplated by this Agreement.

representatives may reasonably request, and, during such period, upon request
by Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
furnish promptly to Parent a copy of any report, schedule,

however, that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent
that any law, treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity
applicable to the Company requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to
restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or information. The
Company shall furnish to Parent, at the earliest time they are available, but
in no event more than 20 days after the end of the relevant period, such
monthly and quarterly financial statements and data as are routinely prepared
by the Company.

  



  

 **5.5** ** _Public Disclosure_**. Neither the Company, Parent nor any of
their respective affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
other transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of
the other party, except as may be required by law or by any listing agreement
with, or the policies of, a national securities exchange in which

promptly supply the other with any information which may be required in order
to effectuate any filings or application pursuant to Section 5.6(a). Except
where prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements, and subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and a mutually acceptable joint defense agreement,
each of the Company and Parent shall consult with outside counsel to the
other prior to taking a position with respect to any such filing, shall
permit outside counsel to the other to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, white papers,
arguments, opinions and proposals before making or submitting any of the
foregoing to any Governmental Entity by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with any investigations or proceedings in connection with
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby
(including under any Antitrust Laws or other fair trade Legal Requirement),
coordinate with outside counsel to the other in preparing and exchanging such
information and promptly provide outside counsel to the other with copies of
all filings, presentations or submissions (and a summary of any oral

hereby, provided that with respect to any such filing, presentation or
submission, each of Parent and the Company need not supply outside counsel to
the other with copies (or in case of oral presentations, a summary) to the
extent that any law, treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity
applicable to such party requires such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict
or prohibit access to any such properties or information.

  



  

41   

     
   

  



  

(c) _Notification_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will notify

Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 hereof and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, each of the parties agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using commercially reasonable
efforts to accomplish the following:  (i) the taking of all reasonable acts
necessary to cause the conditions precedent set forth in Article VI to be
satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions,
waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental
Entities and the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and
filings (including registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental

Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (vi) the execution or delivery
of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. The
Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any takeover statute or similar
Legal Requirement is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Legal Requirement on

and without limiting the foregoing, in the context of this Section 5.6,
"commercially reasonable efforts" shall include the following:

  



  

(i) Parent and the Company shall timely comply with all restrictions and
conditions, if any, specified or imposed by any Antitrust Authority with
respect to Antitrust Laws as a requirement for granting any necessary
clearance or terminating any applicable waiting period, including agreeing to
hold separate, divest, license or cause a third party to purchase, assets
and/or businesses of Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, it being
understood that Parent shall be permitted to negotiate in good faith with the
Antitrust Authorities;

  



  

42   

     
   

  



  

(ii) in the event any Antitrust Authority initiates a proceeding before
any Governmental Entity seeking to restrain, enjoin or prohibit the sale of
the Company Common Stock, Parent and the Company shall use their best efforts
to prevent the entry of any order restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the
sale of the Company Common Stock, including by retaining all appropriate
expert witnesses and consultants. The Company shall be permitted to
participate in all aspects of the defense of such proceedings and Parent
shall use its best efforts to prevail in the litigation. Parent shall be
responsible for the payment of its own expenses, including legal fees and
expenses, in seeking to prevent the entry of any such order; and

  



  

(iii) Neither Parent nor the Company shall agree with any Antitrust Authority
to delay the Closing, and neither the Parent nor the Company shall agree to

case, without the consent of the other party.

 **5.7** ** _Notification of Certain Matters_**. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company,
of any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement
becoming untrue or inaccurate or any failure of the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement, such that, (A) in the case of the Company,
the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) would not be
satisfied or (B) in the case of Parent or Merger Sub, the conditions set
forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) would not be satisfied; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall
not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any of the
parties sending or receiving such notice.

  



  

43

Parties** ") under the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company
and any agreement between an Indemnified Party and the Company or a
Subsidiary of the Company as in effect as of the date hereof that is listed
in Section 5.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. The Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions
with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses that
are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in
the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company as in effect on
the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner.

  



  

(b) _Insurance_.  For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time,
Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect
the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company covering those persons (but only those persons) who
are currently covered by such policies; provided, however, that in no event
will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay an annual premium
on such insurance policy that is greater than 200% of the annual premium
currently payable by the Company for such coverage and provided, further,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event such coverage is no longer
available (or is only available for an amount in excess of 200% of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage), Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such
coverage as may be obtained for such 200% amount.  Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, however, if requested to do so in writing by the Company,
concurrent with the Effective Time, satisfy their obligations under the first
sentence of this Section 5.8(b) by purchasing a "tail" policy under the
Companys existing directors and officers insurance policy which (i) has an
effective term of six (6) years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers those
persons (but only those persons) who are currently covered by the Companys
directors and officers insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof,
and (iii) contains terms and conditions (including coverage amounts) which
are no less advantageous that those contained in the terms and conditions of
the Company directors and officers insurance policies in effect as of the
date hereof.

  



  

(c) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified
Party against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines
and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees
and disbursements (collectively, " **Costs** "), incurred in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to
(i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director,
employee or agent of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (ii) matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this
Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby), whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law; (iii) the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act or similar state or foreign provision as a result
of a termination of employment or a

  



  

44   

     
   

  



  

layoff with respect to any employee of the Company that occurs after the
Closing Date; or (iv) the Companys participation in the arrangement of the
Financing contemplated by Section 5.11(b). Each Indemnified Party will be
entitled to payment of expenses incurred in the defense of any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation from Parent and the Surviving Corporation,
jointly and severally, within ten business days of receipt by the Surviving
Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor; provided that
any person to whom expenses are paid provides an undertaking, to the extent
required by Delaware Law, to repay such amounts if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

  



  

(d) _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Section 5.8 is intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties and their
heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent and the
Surviving Corporation and its successors and assigns. In the event Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or its successor or assign (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successor and assign of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honors the
obligations set forth with respect to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, in this Section 5.8.

  



  

 **5.9** ** _Compliance with Section 409A; Continuation of Deferred
Compensation Programs _**. From and after the Effective Time, Parent will,
and will cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries
to, amend and administer the Companys Deferred Compensation Plan and any
related rabbi trust, as well as shares deferred pursuant to the Companys
1999 Incentive Plan as Amended (such deferred shares and the Companys
Deferred Compensation Plan together referred to as the " **Deferred
Compensation Plans** "), in accordance with their respective terms and in
material compliance with Section 409A of the Code and any regulations or
guidance promulgated thereunder (together, " **Section 409A**"). In the event
the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plans (or related rabbi trust) are not
in material compliance with Section 409A, the Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries to, timely amend such
terms (or trust, as applicable) so as to comply in all material respects with
Section 409A (it being intended that any such amendment shall preserve, as
near as reasonably possible within the limitations of Section 409A, the
original intended terms of such Deferred Compensation Plan or related trust
and any applicable participant elections thereunder). Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to, and will
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation and
each of its Subsidiaries to: (1) not terminate any Deferred Compensation
Plan earlier than December 31, 2010 (and, even then, any such termination
shall be in compliance with Section 409A) and not terminate or withdraw
funds from any rabbi trust related to any Deferred Compensation Plan until
all benefits obligations under that plan have been satisfied (such
limitations shall not limit distributions to general creditors of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, as provided in any such
rabbi trust related to such Deferred Compensation Plan), (2) continue to
offer substantially the same participant investment (or deemed investment, as
the case may be) choices under such plan as exist immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than common stock or any other securities of the
Company or its Subsidiaries to the extent permitted thereunder), and

  



  

45   

     
   

  



  

(3) continue to fund and invest the rabbi trust related to the Deferred
Compensation Plan in substantially the same manner (without limiting the
generality of this clause, any such rabbi trust will be funded on an ongoing
basis such that the fair market value of the assets of such trust are
substantially equal to the accrued and unpaid benefit obligations under the
related Deferred Compensation Plan). Nothing in this Section 5.9 shall
limit the Parents, the Surviving Corporations or any of their Subsidiaries
right to cease making employer contributions to any Deferred Compensation
Plan or, for periods beginning after calendar year 2006, terminate the
ability of participants in any Deferred Compensation Plan to make deferral
contributions.

  



  

 **5.10** ** _Section 16 Matters_**. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent
permitted under applicable law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock)
or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated
by Article I of this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  



  

 **5.11** ** _Financing_**.

  



  

(a) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all commercially
reasonable things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Financing on
the terms and conditions described in the Financing Letters, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing
Letters, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent
and Merger Sub to obtaining the Financing set forth therein, (iii) enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on or before the Closing Date on
the terms and conditions contemplated by the Financing Letters or on other
terms as Parent determines reasonably and in good faith are not materially
less beneficial to Merger Sub, including with respect to conditionality, and
(iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to Closing. In the event any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Debt Financing Letters, Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain alternative debt
financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on terms Parent determines
reasonably and in good faith are not materially less beneficial to Merger Sub
as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. At the
Companys request, Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed with
respect to all material activity concerning the status of the Financing and
shall give the Company prompt notice of any material adverse change with
respect to the Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees to
notify the Company promptly, and in any event within two (2) business days,
if at any time prior to the Closing Date (i) any Financing Letter shall
expire or be terminated for any reason or (ii) any financing source that is a
party to any Financing Letter notifies Parent or Merger Sub that such source
no longer intends to either provide or underwrite financing to Merger Sub on
the material terms set forth therein.

  



  

46   

     
   

  



  

(b) The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its
and their Representatives to provide, such reasonable cooperation (including
with respect to timeliness) in connection with the arrangement and marketing
by Parent of the debt financing contemplated and/or described in the
Financing Letters as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including (i)
participation in meetings, drafting sessions and due diligence sessions, (ii)
furnishing Parent and its financing sources with financial and other
pertinent information regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by
Parent, including all financial statements and financial data of the type
required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, (iii)
assisting Parent and its financing sources in the preparation of (A) offering
documents for any of such debt financing and (B) materials for rating agency
presentations, (iv) cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent and its
financing sources for any of such debt financing, (v) facilitating the
pledging of collateral, (vi) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
accountants comfort letters and consents, legal opinions, surveys and title
insurance as reasonably requested by Parent, and (vii) executing
and delivering such credit or loan agreements, securities purchase
agreements, indentures and other collateral or similar documents requested by
Parent; provided, that in the case of the foregoing clause (vii), the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to incur any indebtedness under
any such agreement or instruments until the Effective Time. Parent shall,
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with such cooperation.

  



  

 **5.12** ** _Merger Sub Compliance_**. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
comply with all of Merger Subs obligations under or relating to this
Agreement. Merger Sub has not engaged in and shall not engage in any business
which is not in connection with the Merger or other transactions contemplated
hereby or with its due organization.

  



  

 **5.13** ** _Resignations_**. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent at the
Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation,
effective as of the Effective Time, of those directors of the Company and any
of its Subsidiaries designated by Parent to the Company in writing at least
ten business days prior to Closing.

  



  

 **5.14** ** _Company Purchase Plan_**. On and after the date hereof, no
future offering periods will be commenced under the Company Purchase Plan.
The Company shall terminate the Stock Acquisition and Retention Program under
the Company Purchase Plan on the date of this Agreement; provided that such
termination shall not affect the Companys obligations as to the operation of
such program prior to such termination. The Company shall terminate the
Company Purchase Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that
such termination shall not affect the Companys obligations as to the
operation of such plan prior to such termination. With respect to matters
described in this Section 5.14, any material notices or other communication
materials provided to the Company Purchase Plans participants shall be
subject to prior review and approval of Parent.

  



  

47   

     
   

  



  

 **5.15** ** _Company Performance Share Plan_**.  Following the Closing,
Parent shall fulfill and honor in all respects the cash payment obligations
of the Company under the Companys Performance Share Plan in accordance with

(e) by the Company by written notice to Parent, upon a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or

meeting of the Company stockholders duly convened therefor or at any
adjournment thereof; provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.1(h) shall not be available to the Company
where the failure to obtain the Company stockholder approval shall have been
caused by the action or failure to act of the Company and such action or
failure to act constitutes a material breach by the Company of this
Agreement.

(ii) _Payment of Parent Termination Fees_. If the Company terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e), and as of such date of termination all
conditions to closing set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of the Merger
Agreement have been satisfied or validly waived by Parent and Merger Sub,
Parent shall pay to the Company a fee of $5,000,000 (the " **Parent
Termination Fee** ") in immediately available funds no later than two
business days after such termination by the Company; provided, however, that
if as of the date of such termination pursuant to Section 7.1(e) Parent or
Merger Sub has received the full amount of the proceeds of the Term
Loan Facilities (as defined in the Debt Financing Letter) and any portion of
the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in the Debt Financing Letter)

in immediately available funds in respect of Expenses incurred by Parent
(without requiring documentation thereof); provided that if the Company is
subsequently obligated to pay a Termination Fee pursuant to Section
7.3(b)(i)(B), such amount shall be credited against the Termination Fee. "
**Expenses** " means all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred
by Parent and Merger Sub (including all fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, investment bankers, financing sources, hedging counterparties,
experts and consultants to Parent and its affiliates) in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Upon the written
request of the Company, Parent shall provide the Company with written

(iv) _Interest and Costs; Other Remedies_. Each of Parent and the Company
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3(b) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Parent and the Company would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner
the

  



  

53

Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on
the amounts set forth in Section 7.3(b)(i), at the prime rate of Citibank,
N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Companys
right to receive payment of (i) the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this
Section 7.3 or the Guarantees and (ii) any fees or expenses as provided in
the Guarantees shall be the exclusive remedy of the Company against Parent,
Merger Sub, the Guarantors or any their respective stockholders, partners,
members, affiliates, directors, officers or agents for the loss suffered as a
result of breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or the failure of
the Merger to be consummated upon termination of this Agreement, and upon
payment of the Parent Termination Fee in accordance with this Section 7.3 or
the Guarantees and any fees or expenses as provided in the Guarantees,
none of Merger Sub, the Guarantors or Parent, or any of their
respective stockholders, partners, members, affiliates, directors, officers
or agents, as the case may be, shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  



  

 **7.4** ** _Amendment_**.  This Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the stockholders of the Company or Merger Sub,
provided, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law
requires further approval by such stockholders without such further
stockholder approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by execution
of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company.

  



  

 **7.5** ** _Extension; Waiver_**. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or (subject to the provisions set forth in Section 7.4) after

legally allowed (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of
such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to

instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Delay in exercising any
right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.

or regulation or GAAP or interpretation thereof after the date hereof, (iv)
any failure by the Company to meet any published or internally prepared

Material Adverse Effect if such facts and circumstances are not otherwise
included in clauses (i)-(iii) of this definition), (v) a decline in the price
of the Company Common Stock on the NYSE (it being understood that the facts

this Agreement or the application thereof becomes or is declared by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder
of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application
of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so
as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the greatest extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

  



  

 **8.7** ** _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_**.

  



  

(a) _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached.

  



  

(b) _Specific Performance_. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall
be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

manner provided by law.

  



  

 **8.9** ** _Rules of Construction_**. The parties hereto agree that they
have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation,

other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior
written approval of the other parties; _provided_ , that Parent or Merger Sub
may assign all or any of their rights and obligations hereunder to a
subsidiary corporation, or to a lender or financial institution as collateral
for indebtedness; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment shall
relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder if such assignee
does not perform such obligations. Any purported assignment in violation of
this Section 8.10 shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
