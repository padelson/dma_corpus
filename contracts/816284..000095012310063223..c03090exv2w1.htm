needed, immediately available funds sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to

herein as the &#147;<U>Exchange Fund</U>.&#148; The Paying Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to
be (1)&nbsp;held for the benefit of the Securityholders and (2)&nbsp;promptly applied to making the
payments and deliveries provided for in this <U>ARTICLE II</U>. The Exchange Fund shall not be

included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, in direct obligations of the United States of
America or obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is
pledged to provide for the payment of all principal and interest, or a combination thereof. Any

consideration to be paid to Securityholders as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace
or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through investments or other events so as to
ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such
payments. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any interest and other
income received by the Paying Agent in respect of such funds) that remains undistributed to the
Securityholders one year after the Effective Time of the Merger shall be delivered to Parent at
such time. Thereafter, Securityholders shall look only to Parent (subject to the terms of this
Agreement and to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as a general creditor for

the surrender of any Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other party hereto

in response to a request by a Person who has made a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was
not initiated or solicited in violation of <U>Section&nbsp;6.3(a)</U>, provide information to such
Person (including to potential financing sources of such Person), if the Company receives from such
Person so requesting the information an executed confidentiality agreement no more favorable in any
material respect to such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in <U>Section
6.4</U>) is to Parent (it being agreed that the Company shall promptly provide to Parent, in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, any information concerning the Company
or its Subsidiaries provided to such other Person which was not previously provided to Parent);

financing sources) who has made a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was not initiated or
solicited in violation of <U>Section&nbsp;6.3(a)</U>, if, in each case, the Board of Directors
determines in good faith after consultation with the Company&#146;s financial advisor and outside legal
counsel that (1)&nbsp;failure to take this action would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of
its fiduciary duties to the Company&#146;s stockholders under applicable Law and (2)&nbsp;the Acquisition
Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal. As used in this Agreement, &#147;<U>Superior Proposal</U>&#148; means an unsolicited, bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof (for this purpose substituting &#147;60%&#148; for
each reference to 15% in the definition of &#147;Acquisition Proposal&#148;) and that the Board of Directors
determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company&#146;s financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) is reasonably expected to be consummated on the terms proposed, taking into account all
legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal, including the financing terms thereof and
the Person making such proposal, and if consummated would result in a transaction that is more
favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account any revisions to the terms of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement agreed to by Parent pursuant to <U>Section
6.3(c)</U>).

could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The written notice shall include
the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, the material terms
of the Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (including any material written amendments or
modifications, or any proposed material written amendments or modifications, thereto), and the
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis of any material changes with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company shall provide Parent with at
least 36 hours prior notice (or such shorter notice as may be provided to the Board of Directors)
of any meeting of the Board of Directors at which the Board of Directors is reasonably expected to
determine that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal. The Company shall not exercise its
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;8.1(e)</U> hereof, and any purported
termination pursuant thereto shall be void of no force or effect, until after the fifth Business

Board of Directors has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions
of the Superior Proposal (and attaching a copy of the definitive agreement related thereto, if
available) and stating that the Board of Directors intends to exercise its right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;8.1(e)</U>. The Company agrees that after notifying Parent that
an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, including during the five-Business Day period
specified in the preceding sentence (such period, the &#147;<U>Parent Review Period</U>&#148;), Parent will
be permitted to propose to the Company revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and the Company and its Representatives will, if requested by Parent, consider in
good faith any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed
by Parent. The Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to <U>Section
8.1(e)</U> if Parent has, during the Parent Review Period, made a binding offer that, after
consideration of such offer by the Board of Directors in
good faith and after consultation with the Company&#146;s financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, results in the Board of Directors concluding that such Superior Proposal no longer
constitutes a Superior Proposal. In the event of any amendment to the consideration or any other
material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this <U>Section&nbsp;6.3(c)</U> with respect to
such new written notice (including a new Parent Review Period except that the new Parent Review
Period shall be three Business Days).

that it will not oppose, and hereby waives any defense to, the granting of an injunction, specific
