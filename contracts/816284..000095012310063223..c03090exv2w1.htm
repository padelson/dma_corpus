ARTICLE II 

   

 _CONVERSION OF SHARES_  

    

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Shares_. 

  

(a) _Conversion of Shares_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or any holders
of shares of capital stock of the Company: 

  

(i) Each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") that is held in the treasury of the
Company and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Sub or any
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or the Company shall be canceled and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor (such shares, the "
_Excluded Company Shares_ "). 

  

(ii) Subject to _Section 2.3_, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Company Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive from Parent (1)
an amount in cash, without interest, equal to $58.00 (the " _Cash
Consideration_ "), (2) 0\. 2617 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of a share of
common stock, par value $.01 per share (the " _Parent Common Stock_ "), of
Parent (the " _Stock Consideration_ "), and (3) one contingent value right (a
" _CVR_ ") issued by Parent subject to and in accordance with the CVR
Agreement (the consideration contemplated by subclauses (1), (2) and (3)
together, the " _Merger_   _Consideration_ "). Each CVR issued as Merger
Consideration hereunder will be substantially in the form attached as Annex A
to the CVR Agreement (the " _CVR Certificate_ "). 

  

All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired, and each holder
of a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") representing any
such shares of Company Common Stock, and each holder of non-certificated
shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry on the records of
the Company or the Companys transfer agent (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable
pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ and any dividends or other distributions to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_,
without interest. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Each share of common stock of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and become at the
Effective Time one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

Section 2.2 _Payment and Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

(a) Prior to the mailing of the proxy statement/prospectus to be included in
the registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed by Parent with the SEC (as
defined in _Section 3.4(a)_) to register the shares of Parent Common Stock
and CVRs to be issued in connection with the Merger (such proxy
statement/prospectus, together with any amendments or supplements thereto,
the " _Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ ", and such registration statement,
together with any amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Registration Statement_ "), Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent hereunder
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of payment of the aggregate
Merger Consideration to be paid and delivered to Securityholders (as defined
in _Section 2.2(b)_) under this _ARTICLE II_. Parent will enter into a
paying agent agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company at least two Business Days prior to the mailing of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to the stockholders of the Company. As used herein, "
_Business Day_ " means any day of the year on which national banking
institutions in New York are open to the public for conducting business and
are not required or authorized to close. 

  

(b) At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent (i) cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash
Consideration (ii) certificates representing a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the number
of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock held by holders (collectively,
the " _Securityholders_ ") of all shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Excluded Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares), and (iii) CVR
Certificates representing the aggregate number of CVRs issuable pursuant to
the CVR Agreement in accordance with _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_ to which the
Securityholders will become entitled under this ARTICLE II at the Effective
Time. Parent further agrees to deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent, from time to time as needed, immediately available funds
sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to  _Section
2.2(e)_ and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to
_Section 2.2(d)_. The aggregate amount of such Cash Consideration and other
cash amounts, certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock and
CVRs deposited with the Paying Agent is referred to herein as the " _Exchange
Fund_." The Paying Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (1) held for the
benefit of the Securityholders and (2) promptly applied to making
the payments and deliveries provided for in this _ARTICLE II_. The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not provided for herein. The
Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed
by Parent, in direct obligations of the United States of America or
obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of all principal and interest,
or a combination thereof. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be kept in the Exchange Fund. To the extent that there are
losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for
other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the
aggregate cash consideration to be paid to Securityholders as contemplated
hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange
Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make
such payments. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of
any interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of such
funds) that remains undistributed to the Securityholders one year after the
Effective Time of the Merger shall be delivered to Parent at such time.
Thereafter, Securityholders shall look only to Parent (subject to the terms of
this Agreement and to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as a
general creditor for payment of the consideration payable to them under this
_ARTICLE II_ , without interest, upon the surrender of any Certificates held
by them. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
none of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other party
hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Law. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) As soon as practicable (but in any event within two Business Days) after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock represented by
Certificates and to each holder of Book-Entry Shares, other than Excluded
Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares: (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon actual
delivery of the Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares, as the case
may be, to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form reasonably agreed upon by
Parent and the Company prior to the Closing); and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares,
as the case may be, in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender
of a Certificate (or delivery of such customary affidavits and indemnities
with respect to a lost Certificate which the Paying Agent and/or
the Companys transfer agent may reasonably require) or transfer of Book-
Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal duly executed and in proper form, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company
Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.1_, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ and any dividends
or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.2(d)_, and the Certificates so surrendered or Book-Entry Shares so
transferred shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or will
accrue on the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares payable
pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ or dividends or other distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_, payable upon the
surrender of any Certificate or transfer of Book-Entry Shares. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of such Certificate and establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered or transferred as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_,
each Certificate or Book-Entry Share (other than Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares representing any Dissenting Company Shares or Excluded Company Shares)
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender or transfer the amount of Merger
Consideration, without interest, into which the shares of Company Common
Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall
have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.1_. 

  

(d) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective
Time with respect to Parent Common Stock, with a record date after the
Effective Time, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate,
and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such
holder pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_, unless and until the holder of such
Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with _Section
2.2(c)_. Subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) the amount of any cash
payable with respect to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect
to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(e) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock, or book-entry credit of the same, shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to
Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional
share and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof
to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. For purposes of this _Section
2.2(e)_, all fractional shares to which a single holder of shares of Company
Common Stock would be entitled shall be aggregated and calculations shall be
rounded to the fourth decimal point. In lieu of any such fractional share of
Parent Common Stock, each holder of Company Common Stock otherwise entitled
to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be entitled to receive
from the Paying Agent a cash payment in an amount, rounded up to the nearest
cent, equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent
Common Stock multiplied by (ii) an amount equal to the average of the closing
sale prices for Parent Common Stock on NASDAQ, as reported in The Wall
Street Journal, for each of the ten consecutive trading days ending with the
seventh complete trading day prior to the Effective Time (the " _Parent Share
Cash Value_ "). 

  

Section 2.3 _Dissenting Company Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock which are
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are
held by holders who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect
thereto in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Company
Shares_ ") will not be converted as described in _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_ , and
holders of such shares will be entitled to receive payment of the value of
such shares determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, after the Effective Time, any such
holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its right to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL, the shares of Company Common Stock
held by such holder that were Dissenting Company Shares will thereupon be
treated as if they had been converted into, at the Effective Time, the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares
payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ and any dividends or
other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.2(d)_, without any interest thereon. Upon the Companys receipt of any
notice of intent to demand payment in accordance with the provisions of the
DGCL, or any withdrawal of such notice, and any other instruments served
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the Company, the
Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable provide Parent with a
copy of such notice or instrument. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to the exercise of dissenters rights under Section 262 of
the DGCL. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent, prior to the Closing, on
the other hand, shall not, except with the prior written consent of the other
party hereto or pursuant to a court order, make any payment with respect to
any such election to dissent or offer to settle or settle any such election
to dissent. 

  

Section 2.4 _No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares_. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by applicable Law. All cash paid (including pursuant to
_Section 2.2(d)_ or _Section 2.2(e)_) and all shares of Parent Common Stock
and CVR Certificates issued upon the surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares, in each case in accordance with the terms hereof, shall be deemed to
have been paid and issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates and/or
such Book-Entry Shares, as applicable. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 2.5 _Closing of Company Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares
of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in
this _ARTICLE II_. 

  

Section 2.6 _Adjustments_. If prior to the Effective Time there is an increase
in the number of shares of outstanding Company Common Stock or Company Common
Stock subject to outstanding Options or SARs (as each such term is defined in
_Section 2.7_) as a result of a distribution, reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, reorganization, merger, subdivision, spin-off, issuer tender
or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Cash Merger
Consideration, the Exchange Ratio, and any other payments to Securityholders
based upon the Merger Consideration will be equitably adjusted to eliminate
the effects of such event on the Merger Consideration and such
other payments. 

   

Section 2.7 _Stock Options, RSUs, SARs_. 

   

(a) _Options_. 

  

(i) At least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, each holder of an
outstanding option, whether vested or unvested (individually, an " _Option_ "
and collectively, the " _Options_ "), that was granted under any Company
stock option or equity incentive plan (" _Company Stock Plan_ ") and that has
an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock underlying such Option
(the " _Applicable Exercise Price_ ") that is greater than the Per
Share Amount shall be provided with written notice that such holder shall,
during the period beginning on the date of such notice and ending on the
Business Day preceding the Closing Date (the " _Exercise Period_ "), have the
right to exercise such Option by providing the Company with a notice of
exercise and a cash amount equal to (A) the Applicable Exercise Price, less
(B) the Per Share Amount, with such exercise conditioned on the occurrence of
the Effective Time. Each Option that is exercised pursuant to this _Section
2.7(a)(i)_ shall be settled at the Effective Time in exchange for, in respect
of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Option, one CVR. Any
Option described in this _Section 2.7(a)(i)_ that is not exercised during the
Exercise Period shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration
therefor. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Per Share Amount_ " means the
sum of (x) the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the Exchange Ratio and (2)
the Parent Share Cash Value, with such amount rounded up to the nearest cent,
and (y) the Cash Consideration. 

  

(ii) Each Option that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that has an Applicable Exercise Price that is equal to or less than
the Per Share Amount shall be cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange for
the right of the holder of such Option to receive, for each share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Option, (A) an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the excess, if any, of the Per Share Amount over the
Applicable Exercise Price, with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded
down to the nearest cent, and (B) one CVR. 

   

(b) _SARs_. 

  

(i) At least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, each holder of an
outstanding stock appreciation right, whether vested or unvested
(individually, a " _SAR_ " and collectively, the " _SARs_ "), that was
granted under any Company Stock Plan and that has a base appreciation amount
(the " _Applicable SAR Base Amount_ ") that is greater than the Per Share
Amount shall be provided with written notice that such holder shall have the
right to exercise such SAR during the Exercise Period by providing the
Company with a notice of exercise and a cash amount equal to (A) the
Applicable SAR Base Amount, less (B) the Per Share Amount, with such exercise
conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time. Each SAR that is
exercised pursuant to this _Section 2.7(b)(i)_ shall be settled at the
Effective Time in exchange for one CVR. Any SAR described in this _Section
2.7(b)(i)_ that is not exercised during the Exercise Period shall be
cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration therefor. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(ii) Each SAR that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and that has an Applicable SAR Base Amount that is equal to or less than the
Per Share Amount shall be cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange for the
right of the holder of such SAR to receive (A) an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the excess, if any, of the Per Share Amount over the
Applicable SAR Base Amount, with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded
up to the nearest cent, and (B) one CVR. 

  

(c) _RSUs_. Each restricted stock unit (individually, an " _RSU_ "
and collectively, the " _RSUs_ ") granted by the Company under any Company
Stock Plan which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
vest as of the Effective Time and shall be cancelled and converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive, and the holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive, (i) cash, without interest, equal to the Per Share
Amount, with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded up to the nearest
cent, and (ii) one CVR. 

  

(d) _Payment for Awards_. Parent shall pay, or cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay through its payroll system, to each holder of Options,
SARs and RSUs the cash payments and CVRs subject to and in accordance with
this _Section 2.7_. 

  

(e) _Termination of Plans; Determinations by the Board_. Each Company Stock
Plan shall terminate as of the Effective Time, and any other plan, program or
arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any interest in respect of
the capital stock (or any interest convertible into or exchangeable for such
capital stock) of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof shall be canceled as
of the Effective Time. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Companys board
of directors (the " _Board of Directors_ ") (or a committee thereof) will (i)
adopt amendments to, or make determinations with respect to, the Employee
Benefit Plans (as defined in _Section 3.10(a)_), the Company Stock Plans,
and the individual agreements evidencing the grant of Options, SARs and RSUs,
as necessary, to implement the provisions of this _Section 2.7_ and (ii)
take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by Parent to implement
the provisions of this _Section 2.7_. 

  

Section 2.8 _Withholding of Tax_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Parent, the Company, any Affiliate thereof (including the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable), Trustee or the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from
amounts (including shares of Parent Common Stock and CVRs) otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement or the Related Agreements to any holder of shares
of Company Common Stock, Options, SARs or RSUs, such amounts as Parent, the
Company, any Affiliate thereof, Trustee or the Paying Agent is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by Parent, the Company, any Affiliate thereof, Trustee or the
Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be (a) paid over to the applicable
Governmental Entity (as defined in _Section 3.3(c)_) in accordance with
applicable Law and (b) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to such holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by Parent, the Company, any Affiliate thereof, Trustee or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 2.9 _Closing._ The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Fried,
Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP, One New York Plaza, New York, New York
10004, at 9:00 A.M. local time on the day which is no later than two Business

subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds in number and each other
Section or subsection of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent that such information is relevant to such other Section or
subsection), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as
follows: 

  

Section 3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (as defined in _Section 9.12_) is a legal entity duly

the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of
its business requires this qualification, except where the failure to be so
organized, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means
any change, effect, event, development, occurrence, condition or state of
facts (collectively, " _Effects_ "), that, in the aggregate with all other
Effects, is, or would reasonably be expected to be, (1) materially adverse to
the business, assets, financial condition or results of operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (2) prevent the
consummation of the Merger; provided that in no event shall any of the

the following be taken into account in determining whether there has been, or
there would reasonably be expected to be, a Company Material Adverse Effect:
(a) any Effect relating to, or resulting from, any change or developments in
or to local, regional, national or foreign political, economic or financial
conditions or in or to local, regional, national or foreign credit,

change) of the Company Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market of The
NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (" _NASDAQ_ ") (provided, however, that the facts and
circumstances giving rise to such Effect that are not otherwise excluded from
the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect may be considered
for purposes of determining whether there has been, or would reasonably be
expected to be, a Company Material Adverse Effect), (e) any Effect 

  

    ##### 

  

   

 relating to, or resulting from, the adoption, implementation, promulgation,

Section 4.5 _SEC Documents_. 

  

(a) Since January 1, 2008, Parent has filed with, or furnished to, the SEC all

Act or the Exchange Act (collectively, the " _Parent SEC Documents_ "). As of
their respective dates, Parent SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, and as of their respective dates and except as amended
or supplemented prior to the date hereof (or with respect to Parent SEC
Documents filed or furnished after the date hereof, except as amended or
supplemented prior to the Closing Date), none of Parent SEC Documents
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except that no representation is made by Parent with respect
to information supplied by the Company or its Subsidiaries in writing for
inclusion in the Registration Statement. Each of the consolidated financial
statements of Parent (including, in each case, any notes thereto) included in
Parent SEC Documents (collectively, the " _Parent Financial Statements_ ")
have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP applied on a consistent basis
during the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in
the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the financial
position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof
and the results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments and to any other adjustments set forth therein). As of the date of
this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any pending or
unresolved comments from the SEC or any other Governmental Entity with
respect to any of Parent SEC Documents. 

  

(b) To the Knowledge of Parent, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has

contingencies which (i) are reflected, or for which reserves are established,
on the consolidated balance sheet of Parent as of March 31, 2010, (ii) were
incurred in the ordinary course of business since March 31, 2010, (iii) would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or (iv) have been incurred in connection with
the performance by Parent of its obligations under this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

(c) Each of the principal executive officer and the principal financial
officer of Parent (or each former principal executive officer and each former
principal financial officer of Parent, as applicable) has made the
certifications required by Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14 promulgated under
the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with

meanings ascribed to those terms under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 

  

(d) To the Knowledge of Parent, since January 1, 2008 and prior to the date of
this Agreement, none of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any director,
officer, auditor, accountant or representative of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries has received any substantive complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices. No current or
former attorney representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has reported
evidence of a material violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty
or similar violation by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective officers, directors, employees or agents, to Parents current
board of directors or any committee thereof or to any current director or
executive officer of Parent. 

  

(e) Parent and its Subsidiaries have designed and maintain internal controls
over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurances (i)
regarding the reliability of Parents financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP
(ii) that receipts and expenditures of Parent and its Subsidiaries are being
made only in accordance with the authorization of management and directors of
Parent and such Subsidiaries and (iii) regarding prevention or timely
detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Parents
or its Subsidiaries assets that could have a material effect on Parents
financial statements. Parent has designed and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under
the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that Parent files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and
communicated to Parents management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the principal
executive officer and principal financial officer of Parent required under
the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. 

 

    #####

Contract binding on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
properties or assets or arrangement relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among Parent and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or
any "off balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation
S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of
such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving,
or material liabilities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in Parents or
such Subsidiarys published financial statements or other documents required
to be filed or furnished by Parent under the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act. 

  

(g) Since January 1, 2009, Parent has not received any oral or written
notification of any "material weakness" in Parents internal control over
financial reporting. There is no outstanding "significant deficiency" or
"material weakness" that Parents independent accountants certify has not
been appropriately and adequately remedied by Parent. For purposes of this
Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency" and "material weakness" shall
have the meanings assigned to them in Release No. 2007-005 of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board, as in effect on the date hereof. 

  

Section 4.6 _Absence of Certain Events_. From March 31, 2010 to the date of
this Agreement, there has not occurred any Effect that, individually or in
the aggregate with all other Effects, has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " means any Effects, that,
in the aggregate with all other Effects, is, or would reasonably be expected
to be, (1) materially adverse to the business, assets, financial condition or
results of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (2)
prevent the consummation of the Merger; provided that in no event shall any

engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any non-public
information to any Person (other than Parent, Sub and their Representatives)

breach of the Board of Directors fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law. The Company shall (i) immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing solicitation, discussion or negotiation
with any Person (other than Parent, Sub or their Representatives) conducted
prior to the date of this Agreement by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Representatives with respect to any actual or
potential Acquisition Proposal and (ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable
request that all confidential information provided by or on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to such third party be returned or
destroyed. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 6.3_, the Company may, and may
authorize any of its Representatives to, prior to the date on which the
Stockholder Approval is obtained, (A) in response to a request by a Person
who has made a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was not initiated
or solicited in violation of _Section 6.3(a)_, provide information to
such Person (including to potential financing sources of such Person), if the
Company receives from such Person so requesting the information an executed
confidentiality agreement no more favorable in any material respect to such
Person than the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in _Section 6.4_ ) is
to Parent (it being agreed that the Company shall promptly provide to Parent,
in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, any
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to such other
Person which was not previously provided to Parent); and/or (B) engage in
discussions or negotiations with any Person (and such Persons
potential financing sources) who has made a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that was not initiated or solicited in violation of _Section
6.3(a)_, if, in each case, the Board of Directors determines in good faith
after consultation with the Companys financial advisor and outside
legal counsel that (1) failure to take this action would be reasonably likely
to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Law and (2) the Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal. As
used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited, bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof (for this
purpose substituting "60%" for each reference to 15% in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal") and that the Board of Directors determines in good
faith (after consultation with the Companys financial advisor and outside
legal counsel) is reasonably expected to be consummated on the terms
proposed, taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of
the proposal, including the financing terms thereof and the Person making
such proposal, and if consummated would result in a transaction that is
more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of
view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into
account any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement agreed to by Parent pursuant to _Section 6.3(c)_ ). 

  

(c) The Company shall notify Parent orally and in writing promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any
request for information or inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal. The written notice shall include the identity of
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, the material
terms of the Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (including any material
written amendments or modifications, or any proposed material written
amendments or modifications, thereto), and the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a current basis of any material changes with respect
to such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company shall provide
Parent with at least 36 hours prior notice (or such shorter notice as may be
provided to the Board of Directors) of any meeting of the Board of Directors
at which the Board of Directors is reasonably expected to determine that an
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal. The Company shall not exercise
its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ hereof,
and any purported termination pursuant thereto shall be void of no force or
effect, until after the fifth Business Day following Parents receipt from
the Company of written notice (i) advising Parent that the Board of Directors
has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and
conditions of the Superior Proposal (and attaching a copy of the definitive
agreement related thereto, if available) and stating that the Board of
Directors intends to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8.1(e)_. The Company agrees that after notifying Parent that an
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, including during the five-
Business Day period specified in the preceding sentence (such period, the "
_Parent Review Period_ "), Parent will be permitted to propose to the Company
revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and the Company and its Representatives will, if requested by Parent, consider
in good faith any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement proposed by Parent. The Company shall not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ if Parent has, during
the Parent Review Period, made a binding offer that, after consideration of
such offer by the Board of Directors in good faith and after consultation
with the Companys financial advisor and outside legal counsel, results in
the Board of Directors concluding that such Superior Proposal no
longer constitutes a Superior Proposal. In the event of any amendment to the
consideration or any other material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the
Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to
comply with the requirements of this _Section 6.3(c)_ with respect to such
new written notice (including a new Parent Review Period except that the new
Parent Review Period shall be three Business Days). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) The Company agrees that any action taken by any of its Subsidiaries or a
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if taken by
the Company, would constitute a breach of the restrictions set forth in this
_Section 6.3_, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement (including
this _Section 6.3_) by the Company. 

  

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.3_ shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position with respect to a tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making such
disclosure to the Companys stockholders which, in the judgment of the Board
of Directors after receiving advice of outside legal counsel, is reasonably
likely to be required under applicable Law. 

  

Section 6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. The Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (i) afford to Parent and its
Representatives, upon reasonable notice, reasonable access during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all their
respective employees, agents, properties, books, Contracts, commitments
and records; provided, however _,_ that such access shall not unreasonably
disrupt the Companys operations, and (ii) furnish promptly such information
concerning the business, properties, Contracts, assets, liabilities,
personnel and other aspects of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent or
its Representatives may reasonably request. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 6.4_, (x) the Company shall not be required to
provide any information which it reasonably believes it may not provide
Parent or Sub by reason of applicable Law (including antitrust Laws), which
constitutes information protected by attorney/client privilege, or which
the Company or any Subsidiary is required to keep confidential by reason of
Contracts with third parties and (y) with respect to the Trade Secrets
included in the Company Intellectual Property, prior to the Effective Time
the Company will provide during normal business hours, to not more than three
Representatives of Parent selected by Parent, reasonable access to
documentation related to Trade Secrets, provided that such individuals
execute a separate confidentiality agreement with the Company covering
chemistry, manufacturing and controls and related matters in a
form substantially identical to the form previously executed by Parents
employees. The parties will use reasonable best efforts to make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. All information
exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall be subject to the
confidentiality agreement, dated October 16, 2009 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), between the Company and Parent. 

   

Section 6.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_. 

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all reasonable actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Merger, including (i) the obtaining of all
Consents and the making of all Registrations specified in _Section 3.3(c)_
and _Section 4.4_ and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary
to obtain such Consents and to make such Registrations, (ii) the obtaining of
all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the
defending of any lawsuits or other Proceedings, whether judicial
or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
Merger, including, seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order
entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and
(iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement;
_provided, however_ , that the obligations set forth in this sentence shall
not be deemed to have been breached as a result of actions taken by the
Company that are permitted under  _Section 6.3_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Parent or Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall be obligated to amend or waive the provisions of
any Contract, or obligated to pay any consent or similar fees or payments,
unless such action is conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger.
Without limiting the foregoing, none of the parties shall take or agree to
take any action that could reasonably be expected to result in any of the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ not being satisfied or to prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company undertakes
and agrees to file as soon as practicable, and in any event prior to 10
Business Days after the date hereof, a Notification and Report Form under the
HSR Act with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and
the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the "
_Antitrust Division_ "). Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) respond as
promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from the FTC or the
Antitrust Division for additional information or documentation and to all
inquiries and requests received from any state attorney general or other
Governmental Entity in connection with antitrust matters, and (ii) not extend
any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with the FTC
or the Antitrust Division not to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate impediments under
any antitrust, competition, or trade regulation law that may be asserted by
the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any state attorney general or any other
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the
consummation thereof as promptly as reasonably practicable and shall defend
through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by any
party, including appeals. Without limiting the foregoing and subject to this
_Section 6.5(b)_, Parent shall propose, negotiate, commit to and effect, by
consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture
or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent or, effective as of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, or their respective Subsidiaries
or otherwise commit to take any action which it is capable of taking, take or
commit to take such action that limits its freedom of action with respect to,
or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services or assets of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries, in order to avoid
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or Proceeding, or any impediment
under any antitrust Law, competition, or trade regulation Law, which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing the consummation of the
Merger. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nor anything else contained in
this Agreement, Parent shall not be required to sell, divest or otherwise
dispose of, hold separate, enter into any license or similar agreement with
respect to, restrict the ownership or operation of, or agree to sell,
divest or otherwise dispose of, hold separate, enter into any license or
similar agreement with respect to, or restrict the ownership or operation of
(i)(A) any assets or businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
(B) any assets or businesses of Parent or any of its Affiliates
or Subsidiaries, in the case of either clause (A) or (B), to the extent that
such sale, divestiture, disposition, or agreement would have a material
adverse effect on the business, operations, financial condition or results of
operations of the combined business of Parent and the Company after giving
effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
or (ii) the Product to the extent such sale, divestiture, disposition,
agreement or restriction would have a material adverse effect on the ability
of the Company to exploit the Product in the Applicable Jurisdictions. The
Company shall agree if, and solely if, requested by Parent, to divest,
hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the
businesses, services, or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
provided 

  

    ##### 

  

   

that any such action shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party shall (i) promptly
notify the other party of any material communication to that party from the
FTC, the Antitrust Division, any state attorney general or any other
Governmental Entity and, subject to applicable Law, permit the other party to
review in advance any proposed written communication to any of the foregoing;
(ii) to the extent practicable not agree to participate in any substantive
meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings,
investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Merger unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat; and (iii) furnish the other party with copies of all
correspondence, filings, and communications (and memoranda setting forth
the substance thereof) between them and their Affiliates and their respective
Representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of
their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the Merger. Subject to its obligations in _Section 6.5(a)_, Parent shall
have the right to determine and direct the strategy and process by which the
parties will seek required approvals under antitrust, competition or trade
regulation Laws; provided that Parent will consult with and consider in good
faith the views of the Company in connection with proceedings under or
relating to any such Laws. 

   

Section 6.6 _Benefit Plans_. 

  

(a) During the period beginning on the Effective Time and ending no earlier
than December 31, 2011 (the " _Transition Period_ "), Parent shall provide,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, each active employee of
the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (each, an "
_Employee_ ") with salary, cash bonus opportunities and employee
benefits (including equity-based benefits) that are not materially less
favorable in the aggregate than (i) the salary, cash bonus opportunities and
employee benefits in effect with respect to such Employee on the date of this
Agreement or as increased after the date of this Agreement consistent with
the provisions of _Section 5.1(j)_; (ii) the salary, cash bonus
opportunities and employee benefits generally provided by Parent and its
Subsidiaries (other than the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) from
time to time to employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) in the country that is such
Employees principal place of employment who are similarly situated to such
Employee in title, rank, tenure (counting tenure with the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time to the extent recognized by
the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and reflected on
the books and records of the Company) and job duties; or (iii) any
combination of the foregoing (e.g., during the Transition Period, Parent may
transition an Employee into one or more of its employee benefit programs
while maintaining the Employees salary and cash bonus opportunities as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time); provided, that, (x) for
purposes of and subject to this _Section 6.6(a)_ , Parent shall determine in
its sole discretion the combination of compensation and benefits described in
clauses (i) through (iii) to be provided to any Employee during
the Transition Period and (y) nothing in this _Section 6.6(a)_ shall be
deemed to prohibit Parent from changing the title, rank or job duties of any
Employee at any time after the Effective Time. 

  

(b) To the extent that Employees become eligible to participate in any
"employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Parent Plans_ "),
then for purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting and,
with respect to any Parent Plan that provides severance, vacation or paid-
time off benefits, for purposes of benefit accrual, service with the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as
service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case except as
prohibited by an insurer or service provider under a Parent Plan or by
applicable Law; _provided, however,_ that such service shall not be recognized
to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of
benefits. In addition, subject to the terms of the applicable Parent Plan
and applicable Law, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) waive
all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
Employees under any Parent Plan that is a welfare benefit plan in which such
Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time and (ii)
provide each Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-
of-pocket requirements under any Parent Plans that are welfare plans in which
such Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) Unless Parent directs the Company otherwise in writing no later than five
Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors shall adopt
resolutions terminating, effective at least one day prior to the Effective
Time, the Companys 401(k) Retirement Plan. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall provide Parent with executed resolutions of the Board
of Directors authorizing such termination in a form reasonably acceptable to
Parent. The Company shall also take such other actions in furtherance of the
termination of the Companys 401(k) Retirement Plan as Parent may reasonably
require. 

  

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.6_ shall (i) be treated as an
amendment of any particular Parent Plan, (ii) give any third party any right
to enforce or confer upon the applicability of the provisions of this
_Section 6.6_ or (iii) obligate Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to (A)
maintain any particular Employee Benefit Plan or Parent Plan or (B) retain
the employment of any particular Employee. 

  

(e) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, comply with the
provisions set forth on _Section 6.6(e)_ of the Disclosure Schedule. 

   

Section 6.7 _Fees and Expenses_.

incurred in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees
or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated. 

  

(b) Subject to _Section 6.7(d)_, the Company agrees to pay Parent a fee equal
to $145,000,000 if: 

  

(i) this Agreement is terminated by (A) the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(e)_ (in which case, the fee shall be payable at the time of termination)
or (B) Parent pursuant to  _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section 8.1(d)_ (in
which case, the fee shall be payable within two Business Days after such
termination); 

  

(ii) (x) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(i)_, (y) prior to the date upon which the breach giving rise to
Parents right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_
occurs but after the date hereof, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal (which,
for purposes of this _Section 6.7(b)_, shall have the meaning set forth
in the definition of Acquisition Proposal contained in _Section 6.3(a)_,
except that all references to 15% shall be deemed references to "60%") for
the Company shall have been publicly announced (other than by Parent or its
Affiliates) and (z) within 12 months after such termination either the
Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement relating to an
Acquisition Proposal or a transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal
for the Company shall have been consummated (in which case, the fee shall be
payable within two Business Days thereafter); 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(iii) (x) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)(iii),_ (y) prior to the date of the Company Stockholder
Meeting but after the date hereof, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal for the
Company shall have been publicly announced (other than by Parent or its
Affiliates) and (z) within 12 months after such termination either
the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement relating to an
Acquisition Proposal or a transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal
for the Company shall have been consummated (in which case, the fee shall be
payable within two Business Days thereafter); or 

  

(iv) (w) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)(i)_ , (x) prior to such termination, the Antitrust Approval
shall have been obtained, (y) prior to such termination but after the date
hereof, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal for the Company shall have been
publicly announced (other than by Parent or its Affiliates) and (z) within 12
months after such termination either the Company shall have entered into a
definitive agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or a transaction
contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal for the Company shall have been
consummated (in which case, the fee shall be payable within two Business Days
thereafter). 

  

(c) The fee payable pursuant to _Section 6.7(b)_ shall be made by wire
transfer of same day funds to an account designated in writing by Parent. The
Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in _Section 6.7(b)_ are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Parent and Sub would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due
pursuant to  _Section 6.7(b)_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
or Sub commences a suit which results in a binding nonappealable judgment
rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction against the Company for the fee
set forth in _Section 6.7(b)_, the Company shall pay to Parent or Sub its
reasonable documented costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) in connection with such suit together with interest on the amount due
at the prime rate of Bank of America N.A. in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made hereunder plus 2% per annum. 

  

(d) Parent agrees that, except in the case of fraud or a willful and material
breach hereof (as defined in _Section 8.2_), the payment provided for in
_Section 6.7(b)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent upon
termination of this Agreement under circumstances giving rise to an
obligation (or potential obligation) of the Company to pay the amounts set
forth in _Section 6.7(b)_ and such remedy shall be limited to the aggregate
of the sums stipulated in such _Section 6.7(b)_. In no event shall the
Company be required to pay to Parent more than one termination fee pursuant
to _Section 6.7(b)_. 

  

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
shall be a joint release mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent.
Thereafter, Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, shall use reasonable efforts to consult with each other before issuing,
and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, unless it has made
reasonable efforts to do the foregoing, shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.8_ , Parent and
the Company and their respective Representatives may make public releases
or announcements concerning the transactions contemplated hereby that are not
inconsistent with previous press releases or other public statements made by
Parent and/or the Company in compliance with this _Section 6.8_.

perform its obligations under this Agreement to consummate the Merger in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and (b) to ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Sub shall not
conduct any business or make any investments other than as
specifically contemplated by this Agreement.

sales, use, transfer, real property transfer, documentary, recording, gains,
stock transfer and similar Taxes and fees, and any deficiency, interest or
penalty asserted with respect thereof (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ")
resulting from the transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement. The
Company shall cooperate with Parent as to the filing of all necessary
documentation and Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes. 

  

Section 6.12 _Listing_. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof,
Parent shall prepare and submit to the NASDAQ (or such other exchange(s),
electronic trading networks or other suitable trading platforms as are
mutually agreed by Parent and the Company) an application covering the CVRs
and the shares of Parent Common Stock being issued in the Merger and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the CVRs and the shares of Parent
Common Stock being issued in the Merger (including any CVRs which may be
issued pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)(i)_ and  _Section 2.7(b)(i)_) to be
approved for listing (subject to notice of issuance) for trading on the
NASDAQ (or such other exchange(s), electronic trading networks or other
suitable trading platforms as are mutually agreed by Parent and the Company)
at or prior to the Effective Time. 

  

Section 6.13 _Certain Notices_. Subject to compliance with all applicable
Laws, the Company and Parent, as the case may be, shall confer on a regular
basis with each other, report on operational matters and shall promptly
advise each other orally and in writing upon becoming aware of any Event
having, or which would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Parent and the Company shall
give prompt notice to the other of any Event of which it obtains Knowledge
that would be reasonably expected to materially delay or prevent the
consummation of the Merger. Furthermore, the Company shall give prompt notice
to Parent, and Parent or Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company, upon,
to the Knowledge of the Company or the Knowledge of Parent, as applicable (i)
any representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement becoming untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect, (ii) the occurrence of any condition,
event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to result in any of

(iii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of, or the conditions to
the obligations of, the parties hereto under this Agreement. 

  

Section 6.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof,
shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC
so that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a
covered Person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_") of Company Common
Stock, Options, RSUs and SARs pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall
be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16\. Prior to the Effective

preventing or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and such injunction

any postponement or adjournment thereof) to obtain the Stockholder Approval
in accordance with this Agreement, the Stockholder Approval is not
obtained; 

  

(c) by Parent, if (i) the Company breaches or fails to perform any of its

to or as of the Termination Date (provided that Parent or Sub is not then in

    ##### 

  

  

(e) by the Company, prior to the date on which the Stockholder Approval is

(f) by the Company, if Parent or Sub breaches or fails to perform any of its

Agreement, in any case, as a result of which a condition set forth in
_Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ will not be able to be satisfied prior
to or as of the Termination Date (provided that the Company is not then in
material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement). 

  

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 8.1_, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company, other than
the last sentence of _Section 6.4_, _Section 6.7_, this  _Section 8.2_ and
_Article IX_, which provisions shall survive such termination, and provided
that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any fraud or
willful and material breach hereof. For purposes hereof, a " _willful and
material breach_ " shall mean a material breach that is a consequence of an
act undertaken by a breaching party with the knowledge (actual or
constructive) that the taking of such action would, or would reasonably be
expected to, give rise to a breach hereof. 

  

Section 8.3 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law, this Agreement may be

modified or supplemented except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf

subject to the proviso of _Section 8.3_, waive compliance with any of the
agreements of the other parties or conditions in favor of such party
contained in this Agreement (provided, that a waiver must be in writing and
signed by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective).
Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights. 

  

Section 8.5 _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, an amendment of
this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.3_ or an extension or waiver pursuant

Section 9.3 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder in accordance with their specific terms, including its failure to
take all actions as are necessary on its part to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, will cause irreparable injury to the other party, for
which damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy.
Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the issuance of temporary,
preliminary and permanent injunctive relief in any court of the United States
or any state having jurisdiction to compel performance of such
partys obligations, or to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement, and to the granting by any such court of the remedy of specific
performance of its obligations hereunder, without, in any such case, the
requirement to post any bond or other undertaking, in addition to any
other rights or remedies available hereunder or at law or in equity. Each of
the parties further agrees that it will not oppose, and hereby waives any
defense to, the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that the other parties have an adequate
remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or equity. Each of the parties further waives
any requirement under any Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief. 

  

Section 9.4 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.
