paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with
respect to shares of Company Capital Stock formerly represented thereby until
the holder of record of such Company Stock Certificate shall surrender such
Company Stock Certificate and the Exchange Documents pursuant hereto.

will be terminated or suspended. The Company hereby represents and warrants
that there is no reasonable basis for any claims by any party to an
Acquisition Proposal based upon or arising out of the discussion
or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that the provisions of this Section 4.2 were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed by
the parties hereto that Parent shall be entitled to seek an immediate
injunction or injunctions, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of
money damages as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or
other security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Section 4.2 and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which Parent may be entitled at law or in equity. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth above by any officer, director, agent, representative
or affiliate of the Company acting on behalf of and within the scope of
authority granted by the Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Agreement by Company. If any actions are taken on the Companys behalf outside
of the scope of authority granted by the Company, the Company agrees to pursue
all reasonable remedies against such actor.

 

4.3 _Procedures for Requesting Parent Consent_. If the Company desires to take
an action which would be prohibited pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof without
the written consent of Parent, prior to taking such action the Company may
request such written consent by sending an e-mail or facsimile to each of the
following individuals (and Parent shall cause such individuals to respond in
less than 72 hours to each such request, it being agreed that failure to so
respond within such 72 hours (time being of the essence) shall be deemed the
granting of consent by Parent):

other actions in furtherance of terminating such Severance Plan(s) and 401(k)
Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably require. In the event that termination of any
401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges,
surrender charges or other fees (such charges or fees, the "401(k) Fees")

Expenses incurred by the Company that are not reflected on the Statement of

(iv) any Dissenting Share Payments,

 

(v) any Excess Third Party Expenses, and

 

(vi) any Tax or other liability related to the Spinoff Transaction.

 

The Stockholders (including any officer or director of the Company) shall not
have any right of contribution, indemnification or right of advancement from
the Surviving Corporation or Parent with respect to any Loss claimed by an
Indemnified Party.

(b) Any Person committing fraud or any intentional misrepresentation or

sustained by such Persons, or any of them (including the Surviving
Corporation), directly or indirectly, as a result of such fraud or intentional
misrepresentation or willful breach of a representation, warranty or covenant
committed by such Person.

7.3 _Maximum Payments; Remedy_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 7.3(b) hereof, the maximum amount an
Indemnified Party may recover from a Stockholder individually pursuant to the
indemnity set forth in Section 7.2(a)(i) hereof for Losses shall be limited to
such Stockholders Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
the event of Losses arising out of the Specified Representations, each
Stockholder shall be liable for (and the Escrow Fund shall not be the
exclusive remedy for) all such Losses, but only up to such Stockholders Pro
Rata Portion of $12,500,000 (with such Stockholders Pro Rata Portion of the
Escrow Fund as the first source of payment subject to the limitations and
other applicable provisions hereof). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, in the event of Losses relating to the items set
forth in Sections 7.2(a)(ii)-(vi) nothing shall limit the liability of any
Person (including any Stockholder) for any such Loss; provided that,
notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no Company
Option holder shall have any liability for any matter related to the Spinoff
Transaction or the Spinoff License or any item set forth in Section 7.2(a)(vi)
(and the pro rata portion of liability of each other Stockholder shall be
proportionately increased). 

(c) In calculating the amount due to an Indemnified Party hereunder but not in
determining whether the breach occurred, in the event of any breach or
inaccuracy of a representation or warranty, for purposes of determining the
amount of any Loss no effect will be given to any qualification as to
"materiality," a "Company Material Adverse Effect" or "Knowledge" contained
therein.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties hereto agree
and acknowledge that any Indemnified Party may bring a claim for
indemnification for any Loss under this ARTICLE VII notwithstanding the fact
that such Indemnified Party had knowledge of the breach, event or circumstance
giving rise to such Loss prior to the Closing or waived any condition to the
Closing related thereto.

EXECUTION VERSION



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing shall prohibit
Parent from seeking and obtaining recourse against the Stockholders, or any
of them, in the event that Parent issues more than the Merger Consideration to
which the Stockholders, or any of them, are entitled pursuant to ARTICLE I of
this Agreement. 

(f) Parent acknowledges and agrees that its sole and exclusive monetary remedy
from and after the Closing with respect to any and all claims for any breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth
in this Agreement or any Related Agreement or otherwise relating to the
subject matter hereof or thereof shall be pursuant to the provisions of this
ARTICLE VII.

7.4 _Escrow Arrangements_.

 

(a) _Escrow Fund_. By virtue of this Agreement and as partial security for the
indemnity obligations provided for in Section 7.2 hereof, at the Effective
Time, Parent will deposit with the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount without any
act of the Stockholders, such deposit of the Escrow Amount to constitute an
escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") to be governed by the terms set forth herein.
The Escrow Amount shall be available to compensate the Indemnified Parties for
any claims by such parties for any Losses suffered or incurred by them and for
which they are entitled to recovery under this ARTICLE VII. The Escrow Agent
may execute this Agreement following the date hereof and prior to the Closing,
and such later execution, if so executed after the date hereof, shall not
affect the binding nature of this Agreement as of the date hereof between the
other signatories hereto.

(b) _Deductible Amount_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary but
subject to the limitations and other applicable provisions hereof, except as
set forth in clause (ii) of this Section 7.4(b), an Indemnified Party may not
recover any Losses under Section 7.2(a) hereof unless and until one or more
Officers Certificates identifying such Losses under Section 7.2(a) hereof in
excess of $250,000 in the aggregate (the "Deductible Amount") has or have been
delivered to the Escrow Agent or the Stockholder Representative as provided
in Section 7.4(e)(ii) hereof, in which case Parent shall be entitled to
recover the aggregate Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount. For purposes
of clarity, such Deductible Amount does not mean that each indemnifiable Loss
must exceed the Deductible Amount but instead means that an Indemnified Party
will not be indemnified for the first $250,000 of the aggregate Losses.

 

(ii) Parent shall be entitled to recover for, and the Deductible Amount shall
not apply as a threshold to, any and all claims or payments made with respect
to all Losses (a) incurred pursuant to any intentional breach of a
representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement or any
certificates or other instruments delivered by or on behalf of the Company
pursuant to this Agreement (provided that, in the event of such breach, for
purposes of determining the amount of any Loss no effect will be given to any
qualification as to "materiality," a "Company Material Adverse Effect" or
"Knowledge" contained therein), (b) incurred pursuant to clauses (ii) (except
as set forth in _Schedule 7.4(b)(ii)_ hereof) through (vi) of Section 7.2(a)
hereof, (c) relating to the Specified Representations, or (d) resulting from
the failure of any Stockholder to pay Agent Interpleader Expenses or Agent
Indemnification Expenses pursuant to clauses (vi) and (vii) of Section 7.4(j)
hereof.

EXECUTION VERSION



 

(c) _Satisfaction of Claims_. Except to the extent that the Losses (i)
resulted from fraud, intentional misrepresentation, intentional misconduct or
willful breach of any representation, warranty or covenant committed by the
Company (in which case recovery of such Losses, at the discretion of an
Indemnified Party, may also be pursued directly against a Stockholder), or
(ii) relate to the Specified Representations, or as otherwise provided in
Section 7.3(b), claims by an Indemnified Party for Losses pursuant to this
Agreement shall be satisfied solely from the Escrow Fund. Other than with
respect to Losses that result from any act of fraud, intentional
misrepresentation, intentional misconduct or willful breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant committed by the Company, the
Indemnified Party shall first seek recovery for Losses pursuant to this
Agreement from the Escrow Fund prior to seeking recovery from any Stockholder
directly.

 

(d) _Escrow Period; Release upon Termination of Escrow Period_. Subject to the
following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in existence immediately
following the Effective Time and shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., local time at
Parents corporate headquarters in California, on the date immediately
following the Survival Date (the "Escrow Period"), and the Escrow Agent shall
release (no later than 2 Business Days after the end of the Escrow Period) the
remaining amounts in the Escrow Fund to the Stockholders in proportion to
their respective Pro Rata Portions following such termination except as set
forth below; _provided, however_ , that the Escrow Fund shall not terminate
with respect to any amount in respect of any unsatisfied claims specified in
any Officers Certificate ("Unresolved Claims") delivered to the Escrow Agent
and the Stockholder Representative (or the Stockholder(s) in the event that
indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from such Stockholder(s))
prior to the Escrow Period termination date with respect to facts
and circumstances existing prior to the Survival Date, and any such amount
shall not be released to the Stockholders at such time. As soon as all such
claims have been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the remaining
portion of the Escrow Fund, if any, not required to satisfy such Unresolved
Claims.

(e) _Tax Reporting Information and Certification of Tax Identification
Numbers_.

(i) The parties hereto agree that, for tax reporting purposes,
the Stockholders shall be deemed to be the owners of all interest on or other
taxable income, if any, earned from the investment of such cash pursuant to
this Agreement and such interest shall be treated for tax purposes as earned
by the Stockholders until the Escrow Fund is distributed in accordance with
this Agreement. The Escrow Amount shall be invested in a U.S. Bank money
market account, as fully described on the attached Exhibit J hereto. Upon the
release of the cash in the Escrow Fund, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall be responsible for calculating the imputed interest, if
any, in connection with such release and providing such calculation to the
Escrow Agent.

 

(ii) The parties hereto agree to provide the Escrow Agent with a certified tax
identification number by signing and returning a Form W-9 (or Form W-8 BEN,
in case of non-U.S. persons) to the Escrow Agent, upon the execution and
delivery of this Agreement.

(f) _Claims for Indemnification_.

 

(i) Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent at any time on or before the last day of
the Escrow Period of an Officers Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall,
subject to the provisions of Section 7.4(g) and Section 7.4(h) hereof, deliver
to Parent, as promptly as practicable, an amount of cash equal to such Losses.
The date of such delivery of an Officers Certificate is referred to herein
as the "Claim Date" of such Officers Certificate (and the claims for
indemnification contained therein). For the purposes hereof,
"Officers Certificate" shall mean a certificate signed by any officer of
Parent: (1) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid, sustained, incurred,
or properly accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay,
sustain, incur, or accrue Losses, and (2) specifying in reasonable detail the
individual items of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each
such item was paid, sustained, incurred, or properly accrued, or the basis for
such anticipated liability, and, if applicable, the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is
related.

 

(ii) In the event that an Indemnified Party pursues a claim directly against
any Company Stockholder(s) or any other Person, subject to the provisions of
Section 7.3, Section 7.4(c), Section 7.4(g), and Section 7.4(h) hereof, each
Person from whom indemnification is sought (an "Indemnifying Party") shall
promptly, and in no event later than 30 days after delivery of an Officers
Certificate to each such Indemnifying Party, wire transfer to the Indemnified
Party an amount of cash equal to the amount of the Loss.

 

(g) _Objections to Claims against the Escrow Fund_.

 

(i) The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund during the
Escrow Period, shall treat such fund as a trust fund in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in
accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE VII. At the time of delivery of any
Officers Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such
certificate shall be delivered to the Stockholder Representative and to
Akerman Senterfitt, and for a period of thirty (30) days after the Claim Date,
the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery to Parent of any Escrow
Amount pursuant to Section 7.4(f) hereof unless the Escrow Agent shall have
received written authorization from the Stockholder Representative to make
such delivery. After the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, the Escrow
Agent shall make delivery of cash from the Escrow Fund equal to the amount of
Losses claimed in the Officers Certificate, _provided_ that no such payment
or delivery may be made if the Stockholder Representative shall object in a
written statement to the claim made in the Officers Certificate (an
"Objection Notice") _provided further_ that, to be effective, such Objection
Notice must (i) be delivered to the Indemnified Party (and, in the case of
a claim for recourse against the Escrow Fund, to the Escrow Agent) prior to
midnight (Florida time) on the 30th calendar day following the Claim Date of
the Officers Certificate (such deadline, the "Objection Deadline" for
such Officers Certificate and the claims for indemnification contained
therein) and (ii) set forth in reasonable detail the nature of the objections
to the claims in respect of which the objection is made.

 

(ii) If the Stockholder Representative (or the Stockholder(s), in the event
that indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from such
Stockholder(s)) does not object in writing (as provided in Section 7.4(g)(i))
to the claims contained in an Officers Certificate prior to the Objection
Deadline for such Officers Certificate, such failure to so object shall be
an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Stockholder Representative and the
Stockholder(s) that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of
the claims for Losses set forth in such Officers Certificate (and
such entitlement shall be conclusively and irrefutably established).

(h) _Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration_.

 

(i) In case the Stockholder Representative delivers an Objection Notice in
accordance with Section 7.4(g) hereof, the Stockholder Representative and
Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholder Representative
and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall
be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of a claim against the
Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make distributions from the
Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.

(ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and
prior to thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of an Objection Notice,
either Parent or the Stockholder Representative may demand arbitration of the
matter unless the amount of the Loss that is at issue is the subject of a
pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be
commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to
arbitration, and in either such event the matter shall be settled by
arbitration conducted by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to Parent and the
Stockholder Representative. In the event that, within thirty (30) calendar
days after submission of any dispute to arbitration, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, then,
within fifteen (15) calendar days after the end of such thirty (30) day
period, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall each select one
arbitrator. The two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator.
If the Stockholder Representative fails to select an arbitrator during this
fifteen (15) calendar day period, then the parties agree that the arbitration
will be conducted by one arbitrator selected by Parent. If Parent fails
to select an arbitrator during this fifteen (15) calendar day period, then
the parties agree that the arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator
selected by the Stockholder Representative.

 

(iii) Any such arbitration shall be held in Alameda County, California (except
that in the case of any subsequent arbitrations, the location of such
arbitration shall alternate between Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Alameda
County, California), under the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of
JAMS/Endispute ("JAMS"). The arbitrator(s) shall determine how all expenses
relating to the arbitration shall be paid, including the respective expenses
of each party, the fees of each arbitrator and the administrative fee of JAMS.
The arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a limited time
period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for
discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole
judgment of the arbitrator or majority of the three arbitrators, as the case
may be, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the
subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit
discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including
attorneys fees and costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or
equity, should the arbitrators or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be, determine that discovery was sought without substantial
justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial
justification. The decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the validity and amount of any
claim in such Officers Certificate shall be final, binding, and conclusive
upon the parties to this Agreement and the Stockholders. Such decision shall
be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions
which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the
arbitrator(s), and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on, and make
distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with, the terms of such
award, judgment, decree or order as applicable. Within thirty (30) calendar
days of a decision of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one party to
another, such party shall make the payment to such other party, including any
distributions out of the Escrow Fund, as applicable.

(iv) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in
any court having jurisdiction. The forgoing arbitration provision shall apply
to any dispute among the Stockholders or any Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Parties under this ARTICLE VII hereof, whether relating to
claims upon the Escrow Fund or to the other indemnification obligations set
forth in this ARTICLE VII.

(i) _Third-Party Claims_. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third party
claim (a "Third Party Claim") which Parent reasonably believes may result in a
demand against the Escrow Fund or for other indemnification pursuant to
this ARTICLE VII, Parent shall notify the Stockholder Representative of such
claim, and the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled on behalf of the
Stockholders, at their expense, to participate in, but not to determine or
conduct, the defense of such Third Party Claim. Parent shall have the right
in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such
claim but shall consult with the Stockholder Representative as reasonable and
allow Stockholder Representative to participate and keep Stockholder
Representative reasonably informed of such proceedings; _provided, however_ ,
that except with the consent of the Stockholder Representative, no settlement
of any such Third Party Claim with third party claimants shall be
determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such matter. In the event
that the Stockholder Representative has consented to any such settlement, the
Stockholders shall have no power or authority to object under any
provision of this ARTICLE VII to the amount of any Third Party Claim by
Parent against the Escrow Fund, or against the Stockholders directly, as the
case may be, with respect to such settlement. If there is a Third Party Claim
that, if adversely determined would give rise to a right of recovery for
Losses hereunder, then any amounts incurred or accrued by the Indemnified
Parties in defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim, regardless of the
outcome of such claim, shall be deemed Losses hereunder.

(j) _Escrow Agent s Duties_.

 

(i) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such
duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any
additional written escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive
after the date of this Agreement which are signed by an officer of Parent and
the Stockholder Representative, and may rely and shall be protected
in relying or refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed to
be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or
parties. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as Escrow Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of
reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of
legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith.

(ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard any and all
warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any other Person, excepting
only orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby expressly authorized to
comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court, awards
of arbitrators and written instructions of Parent and the Stockholder
Representative. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such
order, judgment or decree of any court, award of arbitrator or instructions,
the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any
other Person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such order,
judgment, decree or award being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set
aside, vacated or found to have been entered without jurisdiction.

(iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of the
identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or
purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers
deposited or called for hereunder.

 

(iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any rights
under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any
documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.

(v) In performing any duties under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not
be liable to any party for damages, losses, or expenses, except for gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow
Agent shall not incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to act
made or omitted in good faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted in reliance
upon any instrument, including any written statement or affidavit provided for
in this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be
genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries,
fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any representative
authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel in
connection with performing the Escrow Agents duties under this Agreement and
shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or permitted by the
Escrow Agent in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel. The
Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining and verifying the authority
of any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any party to this
Agreement.

 

(vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with
any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms
or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the
controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent may hold all
documents and the Escrow Amount and may wait for settlement of any such
controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the
Escrow Agents discretion, may be required, despite what may be set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement. In such event, the Escrow Agent will not be
liable for damages. Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at its option file an
action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims
and rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit with
the clerk of the court all documents and the Escrow Amounts held in escrow,
except all costs, expenses, charges and reasonable attorney fees incurred by
the Escrow Agent due to the interpleader action (the "Agent Interpleader
Expenses") and which the parties agree to pay as follows: 50% to be paid by
Parent and 50% to be paid by the Stockholders on the basis of the
Stockholders respective Pro Rata Portions; _provided, however_ , that in the
event any Stockholder fails to timely pay his or her Pro Rata Portion of the
Agent Interpleader Expenses, the parties agree that Parent may at its option
pay such Stockholders Pro Rata Portion of the Agent Interpleader Expenses and
recover an equal amount from such Stockholders Pro Rata Portion of the
Escrow Fund. Upon initiating such action, the Escrow Agent shall be fully
released and discharged of and from all obligations and liability imposed by
the terms of this Agreement.

(vii) The parties and their respective successors and assigns agree jointly
and severally to indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent harmless against any and
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable
costs of investigation, counsel fees, including allocated costs of in-house
counsel and disbursements that may be imposed on Escrow Agent or incurred by
Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of the Escrow Agents duties
under this Agreement, including any litigation arising from this Agreement or
involving its subject matter, other than those arising out of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent (the "Agent
Indemnification Expenses") as follows: 50% to be paid by Parent and 50% to be
paid by the Stockholders on the basis of the Stockholders respective Pro
Rata Portions; _provided, however_ , that in the event any Stockholder fails
to timely pay his or her Pro Rata Portion of the Agent Indemnification
Expenses, the parties agree that Parent may at its option pay such
Stockholders Pro Rata Portion of the Agent Indemnification Expenses and
recover an equal amount from such Stockholders Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow
Fund.

 

(viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least 30 days
written notice to the Parent and the Stockholder Representative; _provided,
however_ , that no such resignation shall become effective until the
appointment of a successor escrow agent which shall be accomplished as
follows: Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to mutually agree on a successor escrow
agent within 30 days after receiving such notice. If the parties fail to agree
upon a successor escrow agent within such time, the Escrow Agent shall have
the right to appoint a successor escrow agent authorized to do business in
the State of California. The successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver
an instrument accepting such appointment and it shall, without further acts,
be vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the
predecessor escrow agent as if originally named as escrow agent. Upon
appointment of a successor escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall be discharged
from any further duties and liability under this Agreement.

(k) _Fees_. All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties
hereunder shall be paid by Parent in accordance with the standard fee
schedule of the Escrow Agent. It is understood that the fees and usual charges
agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered compensation
for ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that
the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if the Escrow
Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement but that has been
requested by an officer of Parent, or if the parties request a substantial
modification of the terms of the Agreement, or if any controversy arises, or
if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in, any litigation
pertaining to the Escrow Fund or its subject matter, the Escrow Agent shall
be reasonably compensated by Parent for such extraordinary services and
reimbursed by Parent for all costs, attorneys fees, including allocated costs
of in-house counsel, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay,
controversy or litigation.

(l) _Successor Escrow Agents_. Any corporation into which the Escrow Agent in
its individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a
party, or any corporation to which substantially all the corporate trust
business of the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be transferred,
shall be the Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement without further act.

 

7.5 _Stockholder Representative_.

 

(a) By virtue of the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the
Stockholders, each of the Stockholders shall be deemed to have agreed to
appoint James Riley as its agent and attorney-in-fact, as the Stockholder
Representative for and on behalf of the Stockholders to give and receive
notices and communications, to authorize payment to any Indemnified Party from
the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by any Indemnified Party, to object
to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, to assert, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply
with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to, any other
claim by any Indemnified Party against any Stockholder or by any such
Stockholder against any Indemnified Party or any dispute between any
Indemnified Party and any such Stockholder, in each case relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and to take all other
actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii)
specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Such agency may be
changed by the Stockholders from time to time upon not less than thirty (30)
calendar days prior written notice to Parent; _provided, however_ , that the
Stockholder Representative may not be removed or any change to the agency made
unless holders of a two-thirds interest of the Escrow Fund agree to such
removal and to the identity of the substituted agent or such change.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a vacancy in the position of Stockholder
Representative may be filled by the holders of two-thirds in interest of
the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Representative,
and the Stockholder Representative shall not receive any compensation for its
services. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholder Representative
shall constitute notice to or from the Stockholders.

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative while acting in good faith
and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Stockholders on whose behalf
the Escrow Amount was contributed to the Escrow Fund shall indemnify the
Stockholder Representative and hold the Stockholder Representative harmless
against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or
bad faith on the part of the Stockholder Representative and arising out of or
in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Stockholder
Representatives duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses
of any legal counsel retained by the Stockholder Representative ("Stockholder
Representative Expenses"). Following the termination of the Escrow Period,
the resolution of all Unresolved Claims and the satisfaction of all claims
made by Indemnified Parties for Losses, the Stockholder Representative shall
have the right to recover Stockholder Representative Expenses from the Escrow
Fund prior to any distribution to the Stockholders, and prior to any such
distribution, shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate setting forth
the Stockholder Representative Expenses actually incurred. A decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative, including an
amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3 and
Section 8.4 hereof, shall constitute a decision of the Stockholders and shall
be final, binding and conclusive upon the Stockholders; and the Escrow Agent
and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction
of the Stockholders. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any
liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative.

agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

9.4 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, the Exhibits hereto,
the Disclosure Schedule, the Nondisclosure Agreement, and the documents and
instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto referenced herein:
(i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings
both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof; (ii) are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or
remedies hereunder; and (iii) shall not be assigned by operation of law or
otherwise, except that Parent may assign its rights and delegate its

9.5 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such

9.6 _Other Remedies_. Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a
party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a

ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

9.11 _USA Patriot Act Compliance_. To help the government fight the funding
of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all

Agent will ask for documentation to verify its formation and existence as a
legal entity. The Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements,
licenses, identification and authorization documents from individuals
claiming authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation.
The parties hereto each agree to provide all such information and
documentation as to themselves as requested by the Escrow Agent to ensure
compliance with federal law.
