Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by Parent and the
Company in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance
with the DGCL (the effective time of the Merger being referred to herein as
the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4  _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger will generally have the
effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the

Corporation, and all debts, Liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, Liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

Section 1.5 _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time:

(a) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended as of the
Effective Time so as to contain the provisions contained immediately prior to
the Effective Time in the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub until
thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and as provided
by applicable Law, except (i) for Article I thereof, which shall read "The
name of the corporation is K2 Inc.", (ii) that amendments may be made to the
extent necessary to comply with the provisions of Section 5.9 hereof
and (iii) the provision in the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub
naming its incorporator shall be omitted; and

(b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be amended as of the Effective Time so as to contain
the provisions contained immediately prior to the Effective Time in the bylaws
of Merger Sub until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions
thereof, the provisions of the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation or by applicable Law, except that (i) references to Merger Subs
name shall be replaced with references to "K2 Inc." and (ii) amendments may
be made to the extent necessary to comply with Section 5.9.

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub and the
officers of the Company (other than those officers who Parent determines shall
not remain as officers of the Surviving Corporation), in each case, as of
the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors
and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation, until their
successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and applicable Law.

II. EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK AND OTHER SECURITIES

Section 2.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as
a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company or the holder of any capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company:

(a) Cancellation of Certain Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock that is
owned by Parent, Merger Sub (including any Shares acquired by Parent or
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective  



 

2  Time pursuant to any agreements with holders of Shares) or the Company (as
treasury stock or otherwise) or any of their respective direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiaries (other than Shares held on behalf of third parties)
will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and no
consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.

(b) Conversion of Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Share_ " and
collectively, the " _Shares_ "), other than (i) Shares to be cancelled and
retired in accordance with Section 2.1(a) and (ii) Dissenting Shares (each, an
" _Excluded Share_ " and collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ "), will
automatically be converted into the right to receive:

(i) A fraction of a share (rounded to four (4) decimal places) of validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Common Stock at an exchange ratio
(the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") as determined in accordance with Section
2.1(b)(iii) (the " _Stock Consideration_ "); and

(ii) An amount in cash equal to $10.85 (such cash consideration,
together with the Stock Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(g), the "
_Merger Consideration_ ").

(iii) The Exchange Ratio shall be equal to 0.1086 shares of Parent Common
Stock for each Share; _provided_ , _however_ , that: 

(A) If the Average Parent Stock Price is greater than or equal to $51.39 (the
" _Final Upper Limit_ "), then the Exchange Ratio shall be 0.0995 shares of
Parent Common Stock for each Share;

(B) If the Average Parent Stock Price is (x) less than the Final Upper Limit,
but (y) greater than $47.11 (the " _Initial Upper Limit_ "), then the Exchange
Ratio shall be equal to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock for each
Share determined by dividing $5.12 by the Average Parent Stock Price;

(C) If the Average Parent Stock Price is (x) less than $38.55 (the " _Initial
Lower Limit_ "), but (y) greater than $34.26 (the " _Final Lower Limit_ "),
then the Exchange Ratio shall be equal to a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock for each Share determined by dividing $4.19 by the Average
Parent Stock Price; and

(D) If the Average Parent Stock Price is lower than or equal to the Final
Lower Limit, then the Exchange Ratio shall be 0.1221 shares of Parent Common
Stock for each Share.

(iv) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Average Parent Stock Price_ " means an
amount equal to the average closing price of the Parent Common Stock on the
NYSE, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, Northeastern edition, for the
ten (10) consecutive trading days ending on and including the second (2nd)
complete trading day prior to the Closing Date (as adjusted for any
reclassification, recapitalization, subdivision, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or readjustment of, or a stock dividend on, the Parent
Common Stock as provided in Section 2.4).

(c) _Cancellation of Shares_. At the Effective Time, all Shares will no longer
be outstanding and all Shares will automatically be cancelled and retired and
will cease to exist, and, in the case of book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ "), the names of the former registered holders shall be removed from
the registry of holders of such shares, and, subject to Section 2.3, each
holder of a certificate formerly representing any such Shares (each, a
"Certificate") and each holder of a Book-Entry Share will cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest, in accordance with Section 2.2.

(d) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time will automatically be converted into one share of
common stock, par value $0.01 of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.2 _Surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the
holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) Parent will designate, or
cause to be designated, a bank or trust company that is  



 

3  reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to act as
agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of Certificates
upon surrender of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) and Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Article II from time to
time after the Effective Time. Prior to or simultaneously with the
Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub will deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with the Paying Agent cash and shares of Parent Common Stock in amounts and at
the times necessary for the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.1(b) upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (such
cash being herein referred to as the "Payment Fund"). Parent and the Company
will enter into a paying agent agreement at or to prior to the Effective Time
on customary terms, which terms shall be in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company. The Payment Fund shall be invested by
the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the
most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly
available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by,
such investments shall be property of and payable to the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record
of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) a letter of transmittal in customary
form as reasonably agreed by Parent and the Company specifying that delivery
will be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares will pass, only upon proper delivery of Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or evidence of Book-Entry
Shares, as the case may be, to the Paying Agent and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof) and evidence of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon the proper surrender of a Certificate (or effective
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or evidence of Book-Entry Share to the
Paying Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share will
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash and shares of Parent Common
Stock in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings)
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article II, and the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the cash and Parent Common Stock to be paid and issued upon due
surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share may be paid to such a
transferee if the Certificate or evidence of Book-Entry Share formerly
representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

 

(c) _Withholding Taxes_. The Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent will
be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Stock Options or Other Stock Awards
any amounts that are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such
payments under the Code and the rules and Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any amounts
so deducted and withheld will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Shares, Stock Options or Other
Stock Awards, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

(d) _No Further Transfers_. After the Effective Time, there will be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle
transfers of Shares that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Paying
Agent, they will be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as
provided in this Article II.



 

4 (e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, on demand, and any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share
who has not theretofore complied with this Article II will thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of his or her claims for Merger
Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person will
be liable to any former holder of Shares, Stock Options or Other Stock Awards
for any amount delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate has
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond
in customary amount and upon such terms as the Surviving Corporation may
determine are reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement.

(g) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or evidence of Book
Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder
of shares of Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of shares of Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the
Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book
Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash
(without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional
part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the Parent Closing
Price. As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Paying Agent
shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to forward
payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance
with the terms hereof.

Section 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under the DGCL, any
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by a
stockholder (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has neither voted in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and who has
demanded properly in writing appraisal for such Shares and otherwise properly
perfected and not withdrawn or lost his or her rights (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL will not be converted
into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Such
Dissenting Stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised
value of Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of
such Section 262 except that all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who
have failed to perfect or who effectively have withdrawn or lost their rights
to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 will thereupon
be deemed to have been converted into, and represent the right to receive, the
Merger Consideration in the manner provided in Article II and will no longer
be Excluded Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 2.3, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then the right of any
stockholder to be paid the fair value of such stockholders Dissenting Shares
pursuant to the provisions of the DGCL will cease. The Company will give
Parent and Merger Sub prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal,
attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company relating to stockholders
rights of appraisal. The Company will give Parent and Merger Sub the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal. The Company will not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent and Merger Sub, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisals of Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such
demands or approve any withdrawal or other treatment of any such demands.

Section 2.4 _Changes in Capitalization_. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted
to reflect fully: (a) the effect of any reclassification, stock split, reverse
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities  



 

5  convertible into Parent Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or
other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock occurring (or for which
a record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time; and (b) the effect of any reclassification, stock split,
reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization
or other like change with respect to Common Stock occurring (or for which a
record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time.

Section 2.5 _Treatment of Stock Options and Other Equity Based Awards_.

(a) The Company shall take such action as shall be required:

(i) with respect to each option (the " _Stock Options_ ") to purchase Common
Stock granted under any Company Benefit Plans outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, to cause (A) the vesting of any unvested portion of
such Stock Options to be accelerated in full, and (B) the removal of any
restriction placed upon such Stock Options, each effective immediately prior
to the Effective Time;

(ii) to cause each Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time with an exercise price per share of Common Stock less than the
sum of (A) the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Parent Closing Price plus (B)
$10.85 (the " _In-the-Money Stock Options_ ") to be (A) exercised for shares
of Common Stock prior to the Effective Time or (B) converted into Units in
accordance with the first sentence of Section 2.5(b) as of or immediately
prior to the Effective Time;

(iii) to cause: (A) the holder of each Stock Option with an exercise price per
share of Common Stock greater than or equal to the sum of (x) the Exchange
Ratio multiplied by the Parent Closing Price plus (y) $10.85 (the " _Out-of-
the-Money Stock Options_ ") to have a reasonable period of time to exercise
any such Out-of-the-Money Stock Options prior to the Effective Time, with any
such exercise conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger, and (B) any
Out-of-the-Money Stock Options not so exercised to be cancelled as provided
for in Section 2.5(c); and

(iv) to cause all shares of restricted Common Stock granted under the Company
Benefit Plans (and any other shares of Common Stock and restricted stock
units subject to vesting or future issuance under the Company Benefit Plans)
(collectively, " _Other Stock Awards_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time to vest and be issued by the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time and to be treated as Shares at the Effective Time.

(b) Each holder of an In-the-Money Stock Option outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall receive from Parent, in respect and in
consideration of each In-the-Money Stock Option held by such holder, upon
surrender of such In-the-Money Stock Option, a number of Units per share of
Common Stock subject to such In-the-Money Stock Option equal to a fraction (i)
the numerator of which is (A) the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Parent
Closing Price plus (B) $10.85 less (C) the exercise price per share of Common
Stock subject to such In-the-Money Stock Option, and (ii) the denominator of
which is (A) the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Parent Closing Price plus
(B) $10.85. Each "Unit" shall consist of (x) a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio plus (y) $10.85 in cash.

(c) Each Out-of-the-Money Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and not conditionally exercised as provided for in Section
2.5(a)(iii) shall be cancelled.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will adopt such resolutions and
take such other actions as are necessary in order to effectuate the actions
contemplated by this Section 2.5, to the extent practicable, without paying
any consideration or incurring any debts or obligations on behalf of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, provided that such resolutions and
actions shall expressly be conditioned upon the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall be of no
effect if this Agreement is terminated.

(e) The shares of Parent Common Stock forming a portion of the consideration
to be issued upon conversion of In-the-Money Stock Options and the shares of
Parent Common Stock forming a portion of the  



 

6  Merger Consideration issued in exchange for Other Stock Awards shall not be
subject to any restrictions, terms or other conditions (in each case, other
than those imposed by applicable Law). The shares of Parent Common Stock
forming a portion of the consideration to be issued upon conversion of any In-
the-Money Stock Options and all shares of Parent Common Stock forming a
portion of the Merger Consideration issued in exchange for Other Stock Awards
shall be registered by Parent under the Securities Act by means of the
Registration Statement.

(f) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall mail to each Person who is a holder of a Stock Option a letter
describing the treatment of such Stock Option pursuant to this Section 2.5
and providing instructions for use in (i) exercising such Stock Option for
shares of Common Stock prior to the Effective Time or (ii) if not exercised
prior to the Effective Time, receiving Parent Common Stock and cash pursuant
to Section 2.5(b), if applicable, in exchange for the cancellation of such
Stock Option.

Section 2.6 _Treatment of Warrant_. From and after the Effective Time, as
provided for in the Warrant, the Warrant will represent the right to acquire
and receive, upon exercise thereof in accordance with its terms, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time.
In accordance with the applicable terms of the Warrant, Parent shall take all
corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Warrant as
provided for in this Section 2.6.

Section 2.7 _Treatment of Debentures_. From and after the Effective Time, as
provided for in the Debenture Indenture, each Debenture will represent the
right to acquire and receive, upon conversion thereof in accordance with its
terms, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Debenture immediately prior to
the Effective Time. To the extent required by the provisions of the Debentures
and the Debenture Indenture in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (a) Parent and the Company shall enter into a supplemental
indenture to the Debenture Indenture providing for the assumption by Parent of
the obligation of the Company to issue shares of Parent Common Stock to
holders of the Debentures as a portion of the Merger Consideration issuable
upon conversion thereof, (b) Parent shall cause its counsel to deliver to the
"Trustee" under the Debenture Indenture all legal opinions deliverable to

Debentures in accordance with the terms of the Debenture Indenture.

7  the assets and properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
its business makes such qualification or license necessary, except where

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in
violation of its organizational or governing documents.

Section 3.2 _Corporate Authorization; Enforceability_.

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
and to perform its obligations under this Agreement and, subject to adoption

plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not
under common control (within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA) (a "

furnished to Parent correct and complete copies of (i) all plan texts and

given or received since January 1, 2007. Except as set forth in Section
3.13(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, there is no present intention that
any Company Benefit Plan be materially amended, suspended or terminated, or
otherwise modified to adversely change benefits (or the level thereof) under
any Company Benefit Plan at any time within the twelve months immediately
following the date of this Agreement other than as required by applicable Law
or as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 3.13(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter,

any of its present or former directors or executive officers, or (iv)
establishment, adoption, entrance into, or termination of any Company Benefit
Plan (other than as may be required by the terms of an existing Company

(d) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code: (i) there does not
exist any accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of
the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived; (ii) no reportable
event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day
notice requirement has not been waived has occurred, and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result in the
occurrence of any such reportable event; (iii) no liability (other than for
premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the " _PBGC_ ")) under
Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
(iv) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any such plan or
made any inquiry which would reasonably be expected to lead to termination of
any such plan, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no condition exists that
presents a material risk that such proceedings will be instituted or which
would constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of,
or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such plan; and (v) the
funded status of such Company Benefit Plan as reflected in the Company SEC
Documents is accurate in all material respects and such Company SEC
Documents fairly present, in all material respects, the funded status of each
such plan. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has, at any time
during the last six years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to
any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan other than a plan listed on
Section 3.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability to a Multiemployer Plan as a

those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) (a "
_Withdrawal Liability_ ") that has not been satisfied in full.

(e) Except as set forth in Section 3.13(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
each Company Benefit Plan which is intended to qualify under Section 401(a)
of the Code has been issued a favorable determination letter by the IRS with

qualification that would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely
affect such qualification. Each Company Benefit Plan has been established and
administered in all material respects accordance with its terms, and in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA,
the Code and other applicable Laws. No event has occurred and no condition
exists that would reasonably be expected to, subject the Company by reason of
its affiliation with any current or former member of its "controlled group"
(within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code) to any (i) Tax, penalty,
fine, (ii) Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) or (iii) other material
Liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or other applicable Laws.

group health plan continuation Laws, except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

of the Company and its Subsidiaries or with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan; (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company Benefit
Plan; (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of

of ERISA), has engaged in any non-exempt prohibited transaction (within the
meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) which,
individually or in the aggregate, has resulted or would reasonably be
expected to result in any material liability to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Section 3.13(h) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, with respect to any Company Benefit Plan, (i) no material Legal

agent or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has (a) used any

Parent and Merger Sub to the Company concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement (it being understood that any matter disclosed in any section of the
Parent Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be disclosed in any other section
of the Parent Disclosure Letter to the extent that it is readily apparent on
the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other
section), Parent hereby represents and warrants to the Company as of the
date hereof and as of the Closing Date as follows:

Section 4.1 _Organization and Power_. Each of the Parent and its Subsidiaries
is duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of

licensed to do business as a foreign corporation, limited liability company or
other legal entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the
character of the assets and properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its business makes such qualification or license necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in violation of its respective organizational or governing
documents, other than any such violation that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an Acquiror Material Adverse
Effect.

obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Parent Board, at a duly held meeting, has unanimously
(i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger) are in the best interests of the Parent and its
stockholders, and has declared it advisable to enter into this Agreement with
Company, and (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger
Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger
Sub.

Section 4.3 _Enforceability_. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due

Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent

Heckmann to be elected or appointed as a director on the Parent Board at the

Section 5.3 _Other Actions; No Control of Other Party s Business_.

(a) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will not, and will cause their
respective Subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates not to, take or omit any
action that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
result in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VI of this
Agreement not being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions being
materially delayed, except, in the case of the Company, to the extent the
Company Board withdraws, modifies or amends the Company Board Recommendation
to the extent expressly permitted by Section 5.5(d) or delays the Company
Stockholder Meeting as expressly permitted by Section 5.7.

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give Parent, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or its
Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective Time, and nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give the Company, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct Parents or its Subsidiaries operations. Prior to

consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

Merger Sub and their Representatives, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice (i) such access to the officers, management,

such Subsidiaries (so long as such access does not unreasonably interfere
with the operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries) as Parent or Merger
Sub reasonably may request and (ii) all documents that Parent or Merger Sub
reasonably may request. The parties will make appropriate substitute
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

(b) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective Representatives
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
other parties set forth herein.

kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 5.5 _No Solicitation_. 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, except as
specifically permitted in Section 5.5(d), the Company agrees that neither it
nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers or directors of it or its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall cause its and its Subsidiaries
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

(i) initiate, solicit or encourage (including by way of providing information)
or facilitate any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, or the
making, or the completion of, a Takeover Proposal;



 

29 (ii) participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish
or disclose any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, or otherwise cooperate with or assist any Person in
connection with a Takeover Proposal;

(iii) withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation in any manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub;

(iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Takeover Proposal;

(v) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement relating
to a Takeover Proposal; or

(vi) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing (provided,
however, that providing notice of the restrictions set forth in this Section
5.5 to a third party in response to any such inquiry, request or Acquisition
Proposal shall not, in and of itself, be deemed a breach of this Section
5.5(a)).

 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, immediately cease any existing solicitations, discussions
or negotiations with any Person (other than the parties hereto) that has made
or indicated an intention to make a Takeover Proposal. The Company shall
promptly request that each Person who has executed a confidentiality agreement
with the Company in connection with such Persons consideration of a Takeover
Proposal (other than the parties hereto and their respective advisors) return
or destroy all non-public information furnished to that Person by or on behalf
of the Company. The Company shall promptly inform its Representatives of the
Companys obligations under this Section 5.5.

(c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) upon receipt by it or its Subsidiaries or Representatives of (i) any
Takeover Proposal or indication by any Person that it is considering making a
Takeover Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than requests for information in
the ordinary course of business and unrelated to a Takeover Proposal or (iii)
any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) with the identity of such Person and a copy of such Takeover Proposal,
indication, inquiry or request (or, where no such copy is available, a
description of such Takeover Proposal, indication, inquiry or request),
including any modifications thereto. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed on a current basis (and in any event within 24 hours of the
occurrence of any changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of the
status of any such Takeover Proposal, indication, inquiry or request
(including the material terms and conditions thereof and of any
modification thereto), and any material developments, discussions and
negotiations, including furnishing copies of any written inquiries,
correspondence and draft documentation, and written summaries of any material
oral inquiries or discussions. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent orally and in
writing if it determines to begin providing information or to engage in
discussions or negotiations concerning a Takeover Proposal pursuant to
Section 5.5(d). The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not
to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the
date of this Agreement, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is party to any agreement, which prohibits the Company from
providing such information to Parent. The Company shall not, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any
provision of any existing standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions of any such agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be permitted, if it has
otherwise complied with its obligations under this Section 5.5, but only
prior to satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 6.1(a) herein, to:

(i) engage in discussions or negotiations with a Person who has made a
written Takeover Proposal not solicited in violation of this Section 5.5 if,
prior to taking such action, (A) the Company enters into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with such Person and (B) the Company Board
determines in good faith (1) after receiving the advice of its financial
advisors that such Takeover Proposal  



 

30  constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal and
(2) after receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel that failing
to take such action would create a reasonable likelihood of a breach by the
Company Board of its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Laws;

(ii) furnish or disclose any non-public information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to a Person who has made a written Takeover Proposal
not solicited in violation of this Section 5.5 if, prior to taking such
action, the Company Board determines in good faith (A) after receiving the
advice of its financial advisors that such Takeover Proposal constitutes, or
is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal and (B) after receiving
the advice of its outside legal counsel that failing to take such action would
create a reasonable likelihood of a breach by the Company Board of its
fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company under applicable
Laws, but only so long as the Company (x) has caused such Person to enter into
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) concurrently discloses the
same such non-public information to Parent if such non-public information has
not previously been disclosed to Parent; and

(iii) in connection with a Takeover Proposal that is or becomes a Superior
Proposal, withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, if the Company Board has determined in
good faith, after receiving the advice of outside legal counsel that failing
to take such action would create a reasonable likelihood of a breach by the
Company Board of its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Laws, _provided_ that prior to any such withdrawal,
modification or amendment to the Company Board Recommendation, (A) the Company
shall have given Parent prompt written notice advising Parent of (x) the
decision of the Company Board to take such action and the reason for taking
such action and (y) the material terms and conditions of the Takeover
Proposal, including the identity of the party making such Takeover Proposal
and, if available, a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with
such party and other material documents, (B) the Company shall have given
Parent three Business Days after delivery of each such notice to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement (or make another proposal) and shall
have negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to such proposed
revisions or other proposal, if any, and (C) the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith, after considering the results of such negotiations
and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any, and after
receiving the advice of outside legal counsel that failure to make such
withdrawal, modification or amendment of the Company Board Recommendation
would create a reasonable likelihood of a breach by the Company Board of
its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company under applicable
Laws, _provided_ further that, in the event the Company Board does not make
the determination referred to in clause (C) of this paragraph but thereafter
determines to withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation
pursuant to this Section 5.5(d)(iii), the procedures referred to in clauses
(A), (B) and (C) above shall apply anew and shall also apply to any subsequent
withdrawal, amendment or modification.

(e) Section 5.5(d) shall not prohibit the Company Board from disclosing to the
stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act (other than any disclosure prohibited
by Section 5.5(d)); _provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosure other than a
"stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall be deemed to be a withdrawal,
modification or amendment of the Company Board Recommendation in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub unless the Company Board (x) expressly
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation to the Companys stockholders in
favor of adoption of this Agreement or (y) rejects such other Takeover
Proposal.

(f) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person from the
restrictions on "business combinations", "control share acquisitions",
"takeover offers" or similar provisions contained in the DGCL, including
Section 203 (or any similar provisions), or otherwise cause such restrictions
not to apply unless such actions are taken simultaneously with a termination
of this Agreement.



 

31 Section 5.6 _Notices of Certain Events_.

(a) The Company will notify Parent promptly of (i) any communication from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or another Person) is or may
be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(and the response thereto from the Company, its Subsidiaries or its
Representatives), (ii) any communication from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the
response thereto from the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Representatives),
(iii) any Legal Actions threatened or commenced against or otherwise affecting
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and the response thereto from the Company, its

discussions, notices, changes or developments relating to pending material
Legal Actions and (v) any event, change, occurrence, circumstance or
development between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time which
causes or is reasonably likely to cause the conditions set forth in Section
6.2(a) or 6.2(b) of this Agreement not to be satisfied or result in such
satisfaction being materially delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.6(a) shall not, and shall
not be deemed to, cure any breach of any representation or warranty requiring
disclosure of such matter at or prior to the date of this Agreement or affect
any of the closing conditions or otherwise limit or affect the remedies
available. With respect to any of the foregoing, the Company will consult with
Parent and its Representatives so as to permit the Company and Parent and
their respective Representatives to cooperate to take appropriate measures to
avoid or mitigate any adverse consequences that may result from any of the
foregoing.

(b) Parent and Merger Sub will notify the Company promptly of (i) any
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or
other Person) is or may be required in connection with the transactions

Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and the response thereto from Parent, its Subsidiaries or
their Representatives), (iii) any Legal Actions threatened or commenced

Agreement (and the response thereto from Parent, its Subsidiaries or their

development between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time which
causes or is reasonably likely to cause the conditions set forth in Section
6.3(a) or 6.3(b) of this Agreement not to be satisfied or result in such
satisfaction being materially delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.6(b) shall not, and shall
not be deemed to, cure any breach of any representation or warranty requiring
disclosure of such matter at or prior to the date of this Agreement or affect
any of the closing conditions or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available. With respect to any of the foregoing, Parent will consult
with the Company and its Representatives so as to permit the Company and
Parent and their respective Representatives to cooperate to take appropriate
measures to avoid or mitigate any adverse consequences that may result from
any of the foregoing.

Section 5.7 _Securities Filings; Proxy Material; Stockholder Meeting;
Registration Statement_.

(a) Parent and the Company shall make all necessary filings with respect to
the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby under the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act and applicable Blue Sky Laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

(b) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Company Proxy Statement in
preliminary form and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Registration Statement, in which the Company Proxy Statement and a Parent
prospectus relating to the Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this
Agreement will be included, and each of the Company and Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto. Each of the Company and Parent shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing, but, in any event, no more than 3 business days after the SEC
notifies Parent that the SEC will consider a written request for the
acceleration of the effective date of  



 

32  the Registration Statement and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
keep the Registration Statement effective as long as necessary to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Absent any
restraint under applicable Law, the Company will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Company Proxy Statement to be mailed to its
stockholders as promptly as practicable (but no more than 5 Business Days)
after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities
Act. Parent shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do business
in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified) required to be taken
under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger and the Company shall furnish all
information concerning the Company and the holders of the Shares as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action. The parties shall
notify each other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its
staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements
to the Company Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or for
additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all
correspondence between such or any of its representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Company
Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or the Merger.

(c) The Registration Statement shall comply in all material respects with all
applicable Laws respecting securities, including rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC.

(d) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement,
and no correspondence with the SEC with respect thereto, will be made by
Parent or the Company without the prior consent of the other party (including
providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such amendment or supplement). Parent will advise the Company, promptly after
it receives notice thereof, of the time when any of the Registration Statement
has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the
issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent
Common Stock included in the Merger Consideration issuable in connection with
the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the
SEC for amendment of the Registration Statement or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If, at
any time prior to the Closing Date, any information relating to Parent or the
Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, so that
any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable
Law, (i) with respect to the Company Proxy Statement, the Company shall
disseminate an appropriate amendment thereof or supplement thereto describing
such information to the Companys stockholders, and (ii) with respect to the
Registration Statement, Parent shall file with the SEC an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information and the Company shall
disseminate such amendment or supplement to the Companys stockholders.

(e) Subject to Section 5.5 and other than pursuant to Rule 14a-12 of the
Exchange Act with respect to public announcements made in compliance with
Section 5.11, no amendment or supplement to the Company Proxy Statement, nor
any response to any comments or inquiry from the SEC, will be made by the
Company or Parent without the approval of such other party, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(f) The Company Proxy Statement will include the Company Board Recommendation
unless the Company Board has withdrawn, modified or amended the Company Board
Recommendation to the extent expressly permitted under Section 5.5(d).

(g) The Company will call and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as
promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in any
event within forty five (45) days after the mailing of the Company Proxy
Statement) for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding sentence or Section
5.7(f), at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting and subject to
compliance with Section 5.5, the Company may adjourn or postpone  



 

33  the Company Stockholders Meeting in response to a Takeover Proposal for such
time as the Company Board reasonably determines in good faith is necessary
to investigate and consider such Takeover Proposal, if the Company Board
determines in good faith after consultation with its outside financial
advisors that such Takeover Proposal may reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and it has received the advice of its outside legal counsel
that the failure to do so would create a reasonable likelihood of a breach by
the Company Board of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The Company
may also adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to the extent
necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Company
Proxy Statement or Registration Statement is provided to its stockholders in
advance of a vote on the Merger and this Agreement or, if as of the time for
which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth
in the Company Proxy Statement) there are insufficient Shares represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
the business of such Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall not be
required to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting if this Agreement is
terminated before the Company Stockholders Meeting is held. Subject to Section
5.5(d), the Company will (a) use all commercially reasonable efforts to
solicit or cause to be solicited from its stockholders proxies in favor of
adoption of this Agreement and (b) take all other commercially reasonable
action necessary to secure the Requisite Company Vote.

Section 5.8 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

(a) From and after the Closing Date and until December 31, 2007 (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Parent will, or will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other
than those employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement) as of the
Effective Time who continue employment with the Surviving Corporation ("
_Employees_ ") with compensation and benefits that are no less favorable in
the aggregate to those currently provided to such Employees; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing herein will prevent the amendment or termination of
any specific plan, program or arrangement, require that Parent or the
Surviving Corporation provide or permit investment in the securities of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation or interfere with Parents or the Surviving
Corporations right or obligation to make such changes as are necessary to
comply with applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, nothing herein shall preclude Parent or the Surviving Corporation from
terminating the employment of any Employee for any reason for which the
Company could have terminated such Employee prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all
Company Benefit Plans (including any severance, retention, change of control
and similar plans, agreements and written arrangements) in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to
any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by such plans,
agreements or written arrangements. During the Continuation Period, Parent
will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide all Employees
(other than those covered by an individual agreement providing severance
benefits outside the Companys severance policies) who suffer a termination of
employment with severance benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those that would have been provided to such Employees under the
Companys severance policies as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

(c) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation providing benefits to any Employees after the Effective
Time (the " _Post-Closing Plans_ "), each Employee will be credited with his
or her years of service with the Company and its Affiliates before the
Effective Time (including predecessor or acquired entities or any
other entities for which the Company and its Affiliates have given credit for
prior service), to the same extent as such Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under the corresponding Company
Benefit Plan, except for purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit
plans, and except to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of
accrual of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing (i) each Employee immediately will be eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all Post-Closing Plans to the extent
coverage under such Post-Closing Plan replaces coverage under a similar or
comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the " _Pre-Closing Plans_ ") and (ii) for purposes of each Post-Closing Plan
providing  



 

34  medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Employee, the
Surviving Corporation will cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such Post-Closing Plan to be waived for
such Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent any such
exclusions or requirements were waived or were inapplicable under any similar
or comparable Company Benefit Plan, and the Surviving Corporation will cause
any eligible expenses incurred by such Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Pre-Closing Plan ending
on the date such Employees participation in the corresponding Post-Closing
Plan begins to be taken into account under such Post-Closing Plan for purposes
of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Employee and his or her covered dependents
for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance
with such Post-Closing Plan.

(d) This Section 5.8 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.8,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.8.
Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this Section 5.8 will create
any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee, director
or consultant of the Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of continued
employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter. Nothing in this
Section 5.8 is intended to amend any Company Benefit Plan, or interfere with
Parents or the Surviving Corporations right from and after the Effective
Time to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or the employment or
provision of services by any director, employee, independent contractor or
consultant.

(e) Parent shall not take any actions that would have the effect of impairing
or would be reasonably likely to impair the payment of any obligations under
the Brass Eagle, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan or the Rawlings Sporting
Goods Company, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, provided that Parent shall
retain the right to terminate each such plan in accordance with its terms at
any time from and after December 30, 2007. The provisions of this Section
5.8(e) will survive the Closing and are intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each Person described in this Section 5.8(e) and
its successors and representatives after the Effective Time and their rights
under this Section 5.8(e) are in addition to, and will not be deemed to be
exclusive of, any other rights to which such Person is entitled, whether
pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

(f) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
5.8 shall be joint and several.

Section 5.9 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, in which any present or
former director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(together, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") is, or is threatened to be, made a
party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining in whole or in part to, any action or failure to take action by any
such Person in such capacity taken prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation (the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") will, from and after
the Effective Time, jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless,
as and to the fullest extent permitted or required by applicable Law and as
and to the fullest extent required by the Company Organizational Documents
(or any similar organizational document) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, when applicable, and any indemnity agreements applicable to any
such Indemnified Party or any Contract between an Indemnified Party and the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries, in each case, in effect on the date of
this Agreement, against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, legal
and other expenses (including reimbursement as incurred for reasonable legal
and other fees and expenses incurred in advance of the final disposition of
any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, subject to Parents or the Surviving
Corporations receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified Party to repay
such legal and other fees and expenses paid in advance if it is finally
adjudicated  



 

35  (not subject to appeal) that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except
as otherwise expressly set forth in any applicable written agreement between
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any present or
former director or officer thereof, on the other hand, that is in effect on
the date hereof and provides for indemnification of such present or former
director or officer by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of
the matters that are subject to indemnification under this Section 5.9(a),
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable under this
Section 5.9 for any settlement effected without Parents (with respect to
itself) and the Surviving Corporations (with respect to itself) prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(b) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) maintain in effect for
a period of six years after the Effective Time the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time ( _provided_ that the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies issued by an insurer
of comparable standing to the Companys current insurer, and of at least the
same coverage, coverage amounts and deductibles and containing terms and
conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of
the Company) or (ii) obtain as of the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies
issued by an insurer of comparable standing to the Companys current insurer
and with a claims period of six years from the Effective Time with at least
the same coverage, coverage amounts and deductibles and containing terms and
conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of the
Company, in each case with respect to claims arising out of or relating to
events which occurred before or at the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_
that in no event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend an annual premium for such coverage in excess of 225% of the last
annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance prior to the date of
this Agreement (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If such insurance coverage cannot
be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of
the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation will obtain that amount of
directors and officers insurance (or "tail" coverage) obtainable for an
annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.9 will survive the Closing and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and its successors and representatives after the Effective
Time and their rights under this Section 5.9 are in addition to, and will not
be deemed to be exclusive of, any other rights to which an Indemnified Party
is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract, the Company Organizational
Documents (or similar organizational document) or the organizational documents
of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise.

(d) It is expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties (and, if deceased, his
or her heirs or beneficiaries) to whom this Section 5.9 applies shall be
third party beneficiaries of the obligations to such Person set forth in this
Section 5.9. The obligations of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries under this Section 5.9 shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Parties
(or, if deceased, his or her heirs or beneficiaries) to whom this Section 5.9
applies without the consent of such affected Person.

 

(e) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and each of its Subsidiaries to include and maintain in effect in their
respective certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational
document) for a period of six years after the Effective Time, provisions
regarding the elimination of liability of directors (or their
equivalent), indemnification of officers and directors thereof and
advancement of expenses which are, with respect to each such entity, no less
advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions
contained in such organizational documents as of the date of this Agreement.

(f) The obligations and liability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries under this Section 5.9 shall be joint and several. In the
event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Persons,
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any
Person, then and in each case, proper provision will be made so that the
applicable successors, assigns or transferees assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 5.9.



 

36 Section 5.10 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
and in accordance with applicable Laws, each of the parties to this Agreement
will use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to ensure that the conditions set forth in Article VI are satisfied
and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as practicable, including (i) obtaining all necessary actions or non-actions,
waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and making all
necessary registrations and filings and taking all steps as may be necessary
to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by,
any Governmental Entity, (ii) making, as promptly as practicable (and in any
event within 15 Business Days of the date hereof), an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and not extending any waiting period under
the HSR Act or entering into any agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of
Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the
other party hereto, (iii) making, as promptly as practicable, appropriate
filings under any antitrust, competition or pre-merger notification, trade
regulation Law, regulation or order, (iv) obtaining all consents, approvals
or waivers from, or taking other actions with respect to, third parties
necessary or advisable to be obtained or taken in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries
may not pay or commit to pay any material amount of cash or other
consideration, or incur or commit to incur any material liability or
other obligation, in connection with obtaining such consent, approval or
waiver, (v) subject to first having used commercially reasonable efforts to
negotiate a resolution of any objections underlying such lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, defending and contesting any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed (vi) with respect to Parent, taking
all actions necessary to reserve a sufficient number of shares of Parent
Common Stock for issuance in the Merger and the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement and (vii) executing and delivering any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and
to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

(b) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will cooperate and consult with each
other in connection with the making of all such filings, notifications and
any other material actions pursuant to this Section 5.9, subject to applicable
Law, by permitting counsel for the other party to review in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any
proposed material written communication to any Governmental Entity and by
providing counsel for the other party with copies of all filings and
submissions made by such party and all correspondence between such party (and
its advisors) with any Governmental Entity and any other information supplied
by such party and such partys Affiliates to a Governmental Entity or received
from such a Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that material may
be redacted (x) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (y)
as necessary to address good faith legal privilege or confidentiality
concerns. The Company shall not file any such document or take such action if
Parent has reasonably objected (and not withdrawn its objection) to the filing
of such document or the taking of such action on the grounds that such filing
or action would reasonably be expected to either (i) prevent, materially
delay or materially impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or (ii) cause a condition set forth in Article VI to not be satisfied
in a timely manner. The Company shall not consent to any voluntary extension
of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest
of any Governmental Entity without the consent of Parent.

(c) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will promptly inform the other
party upon receipt of any material communication from the FTC, the Antitrust
Division or any other Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (or any
of their respective Affiliates) receives a request for additional
information or documentary material  



 

37  from any such Governmental Entity that is related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then such party will endeavor in good faith to
make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after
consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with
such request. The parties agree not to participate, or to permit their
Affiliates to participate, in any substantive meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement unless it so consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate. Each party will advise the other party
promptly of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written)
which the first party proposes to make or enter into with the FTC, the
Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party will use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve any objections that may be asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any antitrust, competition
or trade regulatory Laws, including (subject to first having used commercially
reasonable efforts to negotiate a resolution to any such objections)
contesting and resisting any action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to have such statute, rule,
regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or administrative order
repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree to become subject to, consent
or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement,
condition, understanding, agreement or Order to sell, to hold separate or
otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise
change the assets or business of Parent or Merger Sub to the extent necessary
to eliminate or remove, as applicable, (i) the commencement of any
administrative, judicial or other proceeding in any forum by any Governmental
Entity with jurisdiction over the enforcement of any applicable antitrust or
competition Laws or (ii) the issuance of any Order by any such Governmental
Entity that would restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise
prohibit consummation of the Merger on or before the Outside Date; _provided_
, _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required by this Agreement to become subject
to, consent or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any
requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or Order to sell, to hold
separate or otherwise dispose of any material assets, or to materially alter
the conduct or operations, or to materially restrict, or otherwise change in
any material respect, the assets or business of Parent or the Company.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company will,
upon the request of Parent, become subject to, or consent or agree to or
otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition,
understanding, agreement or Order to sell, to hold separate or otherwise
dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change
the assets or business of the Company or any of its Affiliates, so long as
such requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or Order is binding on
the Company only in the event that the Closing occurs.

Section 5.11 _Public Announcements_.

(a) The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a joint press
release by Parent and the Company and thereafter Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company will consult with each other before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements about this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with respect to any press
release or public announcement by the Company with respect to any
withdrawal, modification or amendment of the Company Board recommendation as
permitted by Section 5.5(d). Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company will
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except to the extent that the disclosing party determines in
good faith it is required to do so by applicable Laws, court processes or the
requirements of the NYSE or any listing agreement with the NYSE, in which case
that party will use commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other
party before issuing any such release or making any such public statement.



 

38 (b) Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
establish a mutually acceptable process intended to ensure that before any
Merger Communication (as hereinafter defined) of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective "participants" (as defined in Item 4 of Schedule 14A of the
Exchange Act) is (i) disseminated to any investor, analyst, member of the
media, employee, client, customer or other third party or otherwise made
accessible on the website of Parent, the Company or any such participant, as
applicable (whether in written, video or oral form via webcast, hyperlink or
otherwise), or (ii) utilized by any directors, officer, senior manager,
employee or advisor of Parent, the Company or any such participant, as
applicable, as a script in discussions or meetings with any such third
parties, the other party and its counsel have a reasonable opportunity to
review any such Merger Communication for purposes of, among other things,
determining whether that communication constitutes "soliciting material" that
is required to be filed by Rule 14a-6(b) or Rule 14a-12(b) of the Exchange
Act, as applicable. As part of any such process, Parent and Merger Sub or the
Company, as applicable, shall (or shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any such participant to) give reasonable and good faith consideration
to any comments made by the other such party or parties and their counsel on
any such Merger Communication. For purposes of the foregoing, the term "
_Merger Communication_ " shall mean, with respect to any Person, any document
or other written communication prepared by or on behalf of that Person, or any
document or other material or information posted or made accessible on the
website of that Person (whether in written, video or oral form via webcast,
hyperlink or otherwise), that is related to any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and, if reviewed by a holder of the Common
Stock, would reasonably be deemed to constitute a "solicitation" of "proxies"
(in each case, as defined in Rule 14a-1 of the Exchange Act) in favor of the
Merger.

Section 5.12 _Stock Deregistration; Stock Exchange Listing_.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and

or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the
NYSE to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from
the NYSE and the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

(b) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares
of Parent Common Stock constituting Merger Consideration and the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in exchange for or upon conversion of the
Stock Options, Other Stock Awards, the Warrant and the Debentures to be
approved for listing, upon official notice of issuance, on the NYSE.

Section 5.13 _Fees and Expenses_. Subject to Section 7.6, whether or not the
Merger is consummated, all expenses (including those payable
to Representatives) incurred by any party to this Agreement or on its behalf
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (" _Expenses_ ") will be paid by the party incurring those Expenses,
except (a) the Surviving Corporation shall pay the fees of the Paying Agent,
(b) as otherwise provided in Section 7.6, (c) Parent shall reimburse the
Company for its Expenses incurred in connection with, or related to, complying
with its obligations set forth in Sections 5.20, 5.21 and 5.22 (in each case
to the extent that such Expenses are approved by Parent prior to being
incurred), and (d) Parent and the Company shall each be responsible for the
payment of 50% of the fee associated with (i) the filing of a Notification
and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) the filing, printing and mailing the Company Proxy
Statement and (iii) the filing of the Registration Statement.

Section 5.14 _Takeover Statutes_. If any business combination, control share
acquisition, fair price or similar statute is or becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreement, each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company and their respective boards of directors will (a) take
all necessary action to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and (b) otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects
of such takeover statute.



 

39 Section 5.15 _Resignations_. The Company shall cause to be delivered to Parent
at the Closing written evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the
irrevocable resignation, effective as of the Effective Time, of those
directors (or Persons in similar positions) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as designated and instructed by Parent not less than three
Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the " _Resigning Directors_ "). At
the request of Parent, the Company shall promptly provide Parent with a true
and accurate list of each of the directors (or Persons in similar positions)
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. From and after the date of delivery of
such list, the Company shall promptly inform Parent of any matter resulting in
such list no longer being true and accurate.

Section 5.16 _Stockholder Litigation_. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
notify the Company of any litigation commenced against either or any of their
respective directors, officers or Affiliates, relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and shall keep the
Company reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub of any litigation commenced against it
or any of its directors, officers or Affiliates, relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and shall keep
Parent and Merger Sub reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. The
Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub the opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and
its directors relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents and Merger
Subs prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

Section 5.17 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company shall take such steps as may be required to cause
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other dispositions of
Company equity securities (including derivative securities) or acquisitions of
Parent equity securities (including derivative securities) in connection with
this Agreement by each individual who (a) is a director or officer of the
Company or (b) at the Effective Time will become a director or officer of
Parent, to become exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.18 _Company Tax Statements_. The Company shall deliver a statement,
reasonably acceptable to Parent, satisfying the requirements of Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3) and certifying that the
Shares are not and have not been a United States real property interest within
the meaning of Section 897(c)(1)(A) of the Code during the applicable
period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.

Section 5.19 _Certain Notices and Debenture Deliverables_.

(a) The Company shall timely deliver, or cause to be timely delivered, any and
all notices required to be given by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

In connection therewith, Parent shall take all actions reasonably requested
by the Company to facilitate such prepayment and termination, including,
without limitation, depositing or causing to be deposited, not later than at

Indebtedness under the Credit Facility (including any fees, expenses, costs,
commitment fees, penalties, and other amounts payable to the Credit Facility
Agent or the Credit Facility Lenders under the Credit Facility), all as
provided in the Credit Facility. Unless the Credit Facility Agent has
otherwise waived or modified any notice requirements under the Credit Facility
in connection with the performance of the parties obligations under this
Section 5.20 (it being understood that the Company shall request such waivers
and modifications of such notice requirements in accordance with the terms of
the relevant agreements), the Company, in consultation with Parent, shall
provide the advance notice required under the Credit Facility of its
intention to repay all outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Facility and
to terminate the commitments of the Credit Facility Lenders thereunder as of
the anticipated date the Effective Date will occur, as determined by mutual
