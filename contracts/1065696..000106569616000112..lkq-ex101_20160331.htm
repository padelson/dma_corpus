based on the ownership of Company Unit Options or participation in the Company
Option Plan.

statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement") duly executed by the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company (solely in his capacity as such) setting
forth, in reasonable detail their good faith estimates of (a) in the case of
Blocker Seller, the Blocker Adjustment (which can be a negative number) (the
"Estimated Blocker Adjustment") and (b) in the case of the Company, (i) the
Transaction Expenses as of the Closing, (ii) the Debt of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as of the Closing, (iii) the Working Capital Amount and
(iv) the Company Cash Amount, and based on such estimates, an estimate of the
Total Equity Value (the "Estimated Total Equity Value"). The Estimated Closing
Statement and the determinations and calculations contained therein shall be
based on the books and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(and with respect to the Blocker Adjustment, the books and records of Blocker)
and shall be prepared in accordance with this Agreement and, in the case of
the estimated Closing Working Capital Amount, the Accounting Principles. To
the extent reasonably requested by Parent, Blocker Seller and the Company will
make available to Parent and its auditors and advisors all books, records,
documents, work papers and other information of the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and Blocker used in preparing the Estimated Closing Statement.
The Estimated Closing Statement and the determinations and calculations
contained therein (including the estimated Working Capital Amount) will be
prepared and determined, as applicable, in accordance with Section 3.7.1, as
if it were the actual Closing Statement or Closing Working Capital Amount, as
applicable, but based on the review of the financial information of the
Company and Blocker Seller then reasonably available and inquiries

 of personnel responsible for the preparation of such financial information in
the ordinary course of business.

3.7. Post-Closing Adjustment Determination.

3.7.1. As soon as practicable (and in no event later than 75 days after the
Closing Date), Parent will prepare and furnish to the Representative a written
statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail its
calculations of the actual amounts of: (a) the Blocker Adjustment (which can
be a negative number) and (b) each of (i) the Transaction Expenses (the "Final
Transaction Expenses"), (ii) Debt of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
as of the Closing (the "Closing Debt"), (iii) the Company Cash Amount (the
"Closing Cash") and (iv) the Working Capital Amount (the "Closing Working
Capital Amount"), and based on such amounts, the Total Equity Value. The
Closing Statement and the determinations and calculations contained therein
will be prepared and determined in accordance with this Agreement and, in the
case of the Closing Working Capital Amount, the Accounting Principles. Parent
will permit the Company's current Chief Financial Officer to lead the internal
accounting team preparing the Closing Statement, unless he resigns prior to
the completion thereof. The Closing Statement and the determinations and
calculations contained therein shall be based on the books and records of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (and with respect to the Blocker
Adjustment, the books and records of Blocker). In connection with the review
of the Closing Statement, Parent will provide the Representative and its
representatives and advisors with reasonable access to the personnel, books,
records, documents, work papers and other information of Parent, the Surviving
Entity, the Company Subsidiaries and Blocker used in the preparation of the
Closing Statement. The Closing Statement and the determinations and
calculations contained therein (including the Closing Working Capital Amount)
will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties unless the Representative
provides a written notice (a "Dispute Notice") to Parent no later than 60 days
after delivery to the Representative of the Closing Statement setting forth in
reasonable detail (i) any item on the Closing Statement which the
Representative believes has not been prepared in accordance with this
Agreement and (ii) the Representative's proposed determination of the correct
amount of such item in accordance with this Agreement. Any item or amount with
respect to which no dispute is raised in the Dispute Notice will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties.

3.7.2. If Parent and the Representative cannot agree on any items raised in
the Dispute Notice in good faith within 30 days after Parent's receipt of the
Dispute Notice, the parties will submit their final calculations of the items
in dispute to RSM US LLP or, in the event that RSM US LLP declines such
engagement, to an arbitrator who (i) is a certified public accountant (with
significant public accounting experience, including in the context of business
combinations), (ii) has not provided services to either the Company or Parent
or to their respective Subsidiaries in the preceding three years, and (iii) is
appointed by agreement of the Surviving Entity and the Representative or,
failing such agreement within such 30-day period, by either

 party or both parties jointly requesting appointment of an arbitrator by the
American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with its Commercial
Arbitration Rules as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the "Arbitration
Rules"), provided, that such AAA-appointed arbitrator shall have the
qualifications in clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence (RSM US LLP or such
other Person appointed in accordance with this sentence, the "Arbitrator").
The Arbitrator will review such final calculations and, with respect to each
disputed item, make a determination as to the correct amount in accordance
with this Agreement, and based on such amounts, the Total Equity Value and the
Blocker Adjustment; provided, however that the Arbitrator's determinations
will in no event result in any element of the Total Equity Value or any
element of the Blocker Adjustment being greater than the higher of the values
assigned thereto by Parent and the Representative or lesser than the lesser of
the values assigned thereto by Parent and the Representative. The decision of
the Arbitrator will be made in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The decision of the Arbitrator
will be made within 30 days after the Arbitrator is engaged, or as soon
thereafter as reasonably practicable, and will be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties, and judgment thereon may be entered by any court of
competent jurisdiction. Parent, on the one hand, and Representative (subject
to Section 12.3.3), on the other hand, shall bear that percentage of the fees
and expenses of the Arbitrator equal to the proportion of the total dollar
value of all disputed amounts submitted to the Arbitrator that is determined
in favor of the other party by the Arbitrator. Parent, the Surviving Entity
and their Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Representative, on the other
hand, will make available to the Arbitrator all relevant personnel, books,
records and work papers relating to the calculations submitted that are
reasonably requested by the Arbitrator.

3.8. Adjustments to Purchase Price. Upon the final determination of the
Closing Working Capital Amount, the Closing Debt, Final Transaction Expenses,
the Closing Cash and the Blocker Adjustment, the total consideration payable
hereunder to the Equityholders and Blocker Seller in respect of the purchase
and sale of the Purchased Securities and the Merger (the "Total
Consideration") will be adjusted as follows:

3.8.1. If the Total Equity Value exceeds the Estimated Total Equity Value (the
amount by which it is greater, if any, the "Increase Amount"), then Parent
shall, within five Business Days of the final determination of the Total
Equity Value pursuant to Section 3.7, pay (or caused to be paid) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds: (i) to each of the Company Members
(other than Blocker) and Blocker Seller, such Person's Pro Rata Share of such
Increase Amount and (ii) to the Surviving Entity for further distribution to
the Company Optionholders, through the Company's payroll as soon as reasonably
practicable, in each case, subject to Section 3.9, in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Shares, an amount in cash equal to the aggregate Pro Rata
Share of all Company Optionholders of such Increase Amount.

3.8.2. If the Total Equity Value is less than the Estimated Total Equity Value
(the amount by which it is less, the "Deficit Amount"), then, within five
Business

 Days of the final determination of the Total Equity Value pursuant to Section
3.7, Parent and the Representative shall execute and deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to Parent
an amount equal to the Deficit Amount (to the extent the Deficit Amount is
less than or equal to the funds then held in the Adjustment Escrow Account)
from the funds then held in the Adjustment Escrow Account. In the event that
the Deficit Amount exceeds the amount of funds held in the Adjustment Escrow
Account, there shall be no further payment on account of the Deficit Amount;
provided, that if (a) the Deficit Amount exceeds the funds held in Adjustment
Escrow Account (the portion thereof in excess of such escrow funds, the
"Excess Deficit Amount") and (b) any portion of the Excess Deficit Amount
results from the final determination of the Company Cash Amount pursuant to
Section 3.7 being less than, or the final determination of the Debt and/or
Transaction Expenses pursuant to Section 3.7 exceeding, the respective
estimated amount(s) thereof used for purposes of determining the Estimated
Total Equity Value, each Equityholder and Blocker Seller shall be responsible
for paying to Parent its Pro Rata Share of that portion of the Excess Deficit
Amount that does not relate to the amount, if any, by which the final
determination of the Working Capital Amount pursuant to Section 3.7 to is less
than the estimated Working Capital Amount as set forth in the Estimated
Closing Statement. The foregoing payment obligations of the Sellers shall be
satisfied by direct payment from the applicable Seller(s) to Parent. Such
payment obligation of PPG Industries, Inc. shall be several (and not joint and
several) from those of the Kohlberg Sellers and vice versa; provided, however,
the payment obligations of the Kohlberg Sellers shall be joint and several as
among the Kohlberg Sellers. The foregoing payment obligations of any
Equityholders that are not Sellers hereunder shall be satisfied from the
Representative Expense Fund (and thereafter the Representative shall make
equitable adjustment to any funds distributed from the Representative Expense
Fund to the Equityholders and Blocker Seller to take into account that such
payments under this Section 3.8.2 from the Representative Expense Fund were
made solely for the account of the Equityholders that were not party to this
Agreement). If the Deficit Amount is less than the amount of funds then held
in the Adjustment Escrow Account, contemporaneously with the distribution of
funds to Parent from the Adjustment Escrow Account contemplated by this
Section 3.8.2, the remainder of funds then held in the Adjustment Escrow
Account shall be distributed to the Equityholders and Blocker Seller in
accordance with their Pro Rata Shares (on a basis consistent with payments
made under Section 3.8.1) and Parent and the Representative shall provide for
such release in the joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent delivered
pursuant to this Section 3.8.2.

3.8.3. Within five Business Days of any distribution to the Equityholders and
Blocker Seller pursuant to Section 3.8.1 (or a final determination pursuant to
Section 3.7 that the Total Equity Value is equal to the Estimated Total Equity
Value), Parent and the Representative shall execute and deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay (i) to
each of the Company Members (other than Blocker) and Blocker Seller, such
Person's Pro Rata Share of all funds then held in the Adjustment Escrow
Account and (ii) to the

 Surviving Entity for further distribution to the Company Optionholders in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, an amount in cash equal to
the aggregate Pro Rata Share of all Company Optionholders of the funds then
held in the Adjustment Escrow Account.

3.8.4. If the Blocker Adjustment exceeds the Estimated Blocker Adjustment (the
amount by which it is greater, if any, the "Blocker Adjustment Increase
Amount"), then Parent shall, within five Business Days of the final
determination of the Blocker Adjustment pursuant to Section 3.7, pay (or cause
to be paid) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to Blocker Seller
an amount equal to the Blocker Adjustment Increase Amount.

3.8.5. If the Blocker Adjustment is less than the Estimated Blocker Adjustment
(the amount by which it is less, if any, the "Blocker Adjustment Deficit
Amount"), then Blocker Seller shall (within five Business Days of the final
determination of the Blocker Adjustment pursuant to Section 3.7) pay (or
caused to be paid) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to Parent
an amount equal to the Blocker Adjustment Deficit Amount.

3.8.6. Any payment in respect of the adjustment(s) (if any) required to be
made pursuant to this Section 3.8 will be treated as an adjustment to the
purchase price (as determined for Tax purposes).

3.9. Tax Withholding. Each of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Entity
will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any Equityholder or Blocker Seller such amounts as are required to
be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or under any other Legal Requirement. Parent, the Company and the
Surviving Entity (as the case may be) will provide each Equityholder (other
than an employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary) or Blocker Seller
(as the case may be) with written notice of such intended deduction or
withholding within a commercially reasonable period of time before such
deduction or withholding is required. Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Entity (as the case may be) will promptly pay or cause to be paid any amounts
withheld pursuant to this Section 3.9 for applicable Taxes to the appropriate
Governmental Authority on behalf of such Equityholders or Blocker Seller. To
the extent that such amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
applicable Equityholder or Blocker Seller.

Subsidiary. Each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do
business as a foreign entity, and is in good standing as such, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties and assets owned or leased
by it or nature of the Business makes such qualification, licensing or good
standing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or

to the Term Credit Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement.

4.3. Non-Contravention, etc. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement, and the consummation by the Company of any of the
Transactions, do not and will not constitute, result in or give rise to (a) a
breach or a violation of or a default under any provision of the
Organizational Documents of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or (b)
except as set forth on Schedule 4.3 or as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) a breach or violation of or default under

or cancellation of any such material license, permit, franchise or other
governmental authorization is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, neither the Transactions nor, to the Knowledge of the Company,
any other event that has occurred, with or without notice or lapse of time or
both, would or would reasonably be expected to result in the revocation,
suspension, lapse or limitation of any such material license, permit,
franchise or other governmental authorization. Except as set forth on Schedule
4.4, the Company and each Company Subsidiary is and, since January 1, 2013 has
been, in compliance in all material respects with all Legal Requirements and
their respective Organizational Documents. None of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has received since January 1, 2013 any written notice from any
Governmental Authority regarding any actual or alleged violation of, or
failure to comply with, any Legal Requirement in any material respect. Neither

other parties acting on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, has
violated in any material respect any provision of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 or any other

Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, except for (i) such filings

questioned, denied or disputed or in respect of which there is an outstanding
reservation of rights. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in

material respect, any provision contained in any such Insurance Policy. The

combination with any other such payment, to constitute an "excess parachute
payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). Except as set forth
on Schedule 4.14.6, no person is entitled to receive any additional payment

proposed or required to be incurred by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
for the purpose of complying with Environmental Law. Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.16, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has treated,
stored, disposed of, arranged for or permitted the disposal of, transported,
handled, or exposed any Person to any Hazardous Substances in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to give rise to any material liability pursuant

Substances that could give rise to liability on the part of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary under Environmental Law except as would not reasonably be

on, upon, into or from any site currently or, to the Knowledge of the Company,

in connection with the HSR Act notification, the Competition Act Filing, or
any other applicable foreign antitrust or competition laws or regulations and
will consider in good faith the views of the other party in responding to any
such request. Parent will be solely responsible for all filing fees required
to be paid in connection therewith. The parties will use their respective
reasonable best efforts and will cooperate fully with one another to comply as
promptly as practicable with all governmental requirements applicable to the
Transactions and to obtain promptly all approvals, orders, permits or other
consents of any applicable Governmental Authorities necessary for the
consummation of the Transactions. Each of the parties will furnish to the
other parties and, upon request, to any Governmental Authorities, such
information and assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with
the foregoing, including by responding promptly to and complying fully with
any request for additional information or documents under the HSR Act, the
Canadian Competition Act or any other applicable foreign antitrust or
competition laws or regulations. The parties will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to resolve favorably any review or consideration of
the antitrust aspects of the Transactions by any Governmental Authority with
jurisdiction over the enforcement of any applicable antitrust laws.

9.2.10.2. In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 9.2.1, each party hereto will each use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of, or have vacated or
terminated, any Governmental Order that would restrain, prevent or delay the
consummation of the Transactions, including, without limitation by defending
through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court, agency or
other proceeding by any Person, including a Governmental Authority, and (ii)
avoid or eliminate any impediment under any applicable Legal Requirement
related to antitrust that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Transactions so as to enable their consummation as soon as
reasonably possible; provided that no party shall be required to proffer or
agree to license, sell or lease or otherwise dispose of or hold separate
pending such disposition any of its or its Affiliates' assets, rights, product
lines, businesses or other operations or assets.

9.2.10.3. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will promptly notify the
other parties of any substantive communication it or its Affiliates receive

 review in advance any proposed communication by it to any Governmental
Authority. None of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub will agree to participate
in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings,
investigation or other inquiry with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions unless it consults with the other parties in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other parties
hereto the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting.

9.2.11. Consents, etc. Prior to the Closing Date, upon Parent's written
request and at Parent's expense, the Company will use commercially reasonable
efforts (but the Company will have no obligation to pay any fees or incur any
expenses or other Liabilities) to secure such written consents or waivers
under or with respect to the Contractual Obligations described on Schedule
9.2.2; provided, that Parent shall be primarily responsible for drafting all
proposed consent or waiver documentation (subject to the Company's review and
reasonable comment); provided, further, that the obtaining of any such
consents or waivers shall not be deemed to be conditions to the obligations of
the parties to consummate the Transactions contemplated hereby, and the
failure to obtain any such consents or waivers shall not be a breach of this
Agreement by the Company.

9.3. Employees.

9.3.1. Parent shall cause the Company, and if applicable, the Company
Subsidiaries, to provide to their respective employees benefit plans, programs
and arrangements with compensation and benefits (other than equity-based
compensation) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.
Nothing set forth in this Section 9.3.1 will create a contract of employment
with or for the benefit of any employee, or change such employee's status as
an employee at-will. Before December 31, 2016, neither Parent nor the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries (including any person or committee thereof)
shall be permitted to modify, amend, terminate or discontinue, in whole or in
part, any or all of the provisions of the Severance Plan as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, any
amendment, modification, termination or discontinuance of the Severance Plan
on or after December 31, 2016 shall not affect a participant's right to
benefits under the Severance Plan to which the participant became entitled
prior to such amendment, modification, termination or discontinuance.

9.3.2. With respect to any employee benefit plan, program or policy that is
made available after the Closing Date to any employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary as of the Effective Time (a "Company Employee"): (i) all
periods of service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary, as applicable,
or any predecessor entity thereto, by any such employee prior to the Closing
Date will be credited for eligibility, participation and vesting purposes (but
not benefit accrual purposes) under such plan, program or policy and for
purposes of calculating benefits

 under any severance, sick leave or vacation plans, and (ii) with respect to
any Welfare Plans for which such employee may become eligible after the start
of the plan year in which the Closing occurs, the Parent shall or shall make
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such plans to provide credit for the
year in which the Closing occurs for any co-payments or deductibles and
maximum out-of-pocket payments by such employees and to waive all pre-existing
condition exclusions and waiting periods, other than (x) to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, limitations or waiting periods
that had not been satisfied under the corresponding Company Plan and (y), in
the case of sub-clauses (i) and (ii), to the extent that such credit would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service, under corresponding Company Plans prior to the Closing Date. Parent
will or will cause the Company to, and if applicable, the Company Subsidiaries
to, recognize vacation days previously accrued and reserved by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing Date.

9.3.3. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained
in this Section 9.3 are included for the sole benefit of the respective
parties hereto and shall not create any right, including any third-party
beneficiary right, (i) of any employee, former employee or any participant or
any beneficiary thereof in any Company Plan or any Employee Plan of Parent,
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or (ii) to employment or continued
employment or any term or condition of employment with Parent, the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or any Affiliate thereof. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, shall (i) be construed as an amendment to or adoption of
any collective bargaining agreement, Company Plan, or any other employee
benefit or compensation plan, program or arrangement of Parent, the Company,
any Company Subsidiary, or any Affiliate thereof, or (ii) interfere with or
limit Parent's, the Company's or any Company Subsidiaries' or any of their
Affiliate's ability to amend, modify or terminate any collective bargaining
agreement, Company Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement, policy, contract or arrangement or to terminate the employment of
any Company Employee for any reason, in each case in accordance with its
terms.

9.4. Access Prior to Closing.

9.4.1. The Company will, and will cause each Company Subsidiary to, permit
Parent and its directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, accountants,
investment bankers and other appropriate representatives to have reasonable
access, from the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, to the
employees, properties and books and records of the Company and each of the
Company Subsidiaries, (i) during normal working hours, (ii) under the
reasonable supervision of the personnel of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, (iii) at Parent's expense and (iv) upon reasonable notice, to
familiarize itself with the respective properties, business and operating and
financial conditions of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the extent
that Parent and its representatives do not

 unreasonably disrupt the personnel and operations of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, (x) no such Person will have access (1) to personnel records
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary relating to individual performance or
evaluation records, medical histories or other information which in the
Company's good faith opinion is sensitive or the disclosure of which could
subject the Company or any Company Subsidiary to risk of liability or (2) for
purposes of conducting any environmental sampling or testing except with the
Company's prior written consent and (y) neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary will be required to disclose any information if doing so (1) could
violate any Contractual Obligation or Legal Requirement to which the Company
or any Company Subsidiary is a party or is subject or (2) it believes in good
faith could result in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of
privilege (including the attorney-client and work product privileges).

9.4.2. All information provided pursuant to Section 9.4.1 will be subject to
the confidentiality agreement dated August 17, 2015 between the Company and
Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement") and Section 9.9.

9.4.3. The Company will, and will cause each Company Subsidiary to, permit
Parent and its directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, accountants,
and other appropriate representatives to have reasonable access, from the date
of this Agreement through the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, to the employees, properties
and books and records of the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries, (i)
during normal working hours, (ii) under the reasonable supervision of the
personnel of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (iii) at Parent's
expense and (iv) upon reasonable notice, in order for any party to comply with
the notice and reporting provisions available under the China State
Administration of Taxation's Bulletin on Several Issues of Enterprise Income
Tax on Income Arising from Indirect Transfers of Property by Non-resident
Enterprises (SAT Bulletin 2015 No. 7), dated February 3, 2015, as amended. The
parties will (x) use their respective reasonable best efforts and will
cooperate fully with one another to comply as promptly as practicable with any
such notice and reporting provisions that may be applicable to the
Transactions and are invoked by any party and (y) furnish to the other parties
and, upon request, to the China State Administration of Taxation, such
information and assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with
the foregoing.

9.5. Access After Closing. Subject to the next sentence, for a period of five
years after the Closing Date, Parent will, and agrees to cause the Surviving
Entity and each of its Subsidiaries to, preserve and keep, and the
Representative, the Company Members and their directors, officers and
Affiliates and their respective representatives will have reasonable access
to, the books and records of the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to the
extent that such access may reasonably be required by such Persons in
connection with matters relating to or affected by the ownership of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time. Such access
will be afforded by the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries upon receipt of
reasonable advance notice,

 during normal business hours, under the reasonable supervision of the
personnel of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and at the expense of
the party requesting such access. If the Surviving Entity or any such
Subsidiary desires to dispose of any such books and records prior to the
expiration of such five year period, the Surviving Entity will, prior to such
disposition, notify the Representative and give the Company Members and their
directors, officers and Affiliates and their representatives a reasonable
opportunity, at such parties' expense, to segregate and remove such books and
records as such Persons may select.

9.6. Indemnification of Managers, Directors, Officers and Employees.

9.6.1. From and after Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Entity and each of the Surviving Entity's Subsidiaries to, exculpate,
indemnify and hold harmless all individuals who at any time prior to or at the
Effective Time were, are or will be managers, directors, officers, employees
and agents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, "DandO
Indemnified Persons") to the fullest extent currently provided under the
Organizational Documents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
permitted by Legal Requirements from and against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fines, penalties, judgments, amounts paid in settlement,
interest, costs and expenses (including advancement in each instance of the
fees, costs and expenses of counsel and experts as incurred) arising out of
acts or omissions by any DandO Indemnified Persons at or prior to the Effective
Time. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after Closing, the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement provisions in the Organizational Documents of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, in each case as of the date of this
Agreement, will not be repealed, terminated, limited, amended or in any other
way changed, in any way adverse to the DandO Indemnified Persons, for at least
six years after the Effective Time. With respect to any right to
indemnification or advancement of DandO Indemnified Persons with respect to
actions taken or omissions to act occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
the Surviving Entity and each of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall be the
indemnitor of first resort, responsible for all such indemnification or
advancement that any DandO Indemnified Persons may have from any direct or
indirect equity holder of the Company (or any Affiliate thereof) and without
right to seek subrogation, indemnity or contribution.

9.6.2. If the Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries (or, in each case,
any of its successors or assigns) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person (whether by merger, sale of equity, sale
of assets, recapitalization or any other transaction or series of
transactions), then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity or its Subsidiary, as

9.8. Waiver of Conflicts; Privilege. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on behalf

"Parent Related Parties") hereby waives any claim that Ropes and Gray LLP or any
other legal counsel representing the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (each a "Prior Company Counsel") in
connection with this Agreement, the negotiation thereof or the Transactions
(each a "Pre-Closing Representation") has or will have a conflict of interest
or is or will be otherwise prohibited from representing the Representative,
Blocker Seller, any Equityholder (other than Blocker), or any officer,
director, member, manager or Affiliate of the Representative, Blocker Seller
or any Equityholder (collectively, the "Seller Related Parties," which for the
avoidance of doubt will not include the Surviving Entity or any of its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time) in any dispute with any of the
Parent Related Parties or any other matter relating to this Agreement, the
negotiation thereof or the Transactions, in each case, after the Effective
Time, even though the interests of one or more of the Seller Related Parties
in such dispute or other matter may be directly adverse to the interests of
one or more of the Parent Related Parties and even though Prior Company
Counsel may have represented the Company or one or more of the Company
Subsidiaries in a matter substantially

 related to such dispute or other matter and may be handling ongoing matters
for one or more of the Parent Related Parties. Each of Parent and Merger Sub,
on behalf of all of the Parent Related Parties, hereby covenants and agrees,
that, as to all communications between any Prior Company Counsel, on the one
hand, and any Seller Related Parties or the Company or one or more of the
Company Subsidiaries (with respect to the Company or one or more of the
Company Subsidiaries, solely prior to the Closing), on the other hand, that
relate in any way to the Pre-Closing Representation (the "Seller Parties' Pre-
Closing Confidential Communications"), the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belong to and shall be controlled by the
Representative (on behalf of the Seller Related Parties), and shall not pass
to or be claimed by any Parent Related Parties following the Effective Time.
All books, records and other materials of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries in any medium containing or reflecting any of the Seller Parties'
Pre-Closing Confidential Communications or the work product of legal counsel
with respect thereto, are hereby assigned and transferred to the
Representative. Without limitation of the foregoing, no Parent Related Parties
may use or rely on any communications described in the immediately preceding
sentence in any claim, dispute, action, suit or proceeding against or
involving any of the Seller Related Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
after the Effective Time a dispute arises between Parent, Blocker, the
Surviving Entity or one or more of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and a
third party other than (and unaffiliated with) the Representative or the
Equityholders or Blocker Seller or one or more of their Affiliates, on the
other hand, then Parent, Blocker, the Surviving Entity or such Subsidiary (to
the extent applicable) may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure to such third party of confidential communications by Prior Company
Counsel; provided, that none of Parent, Blocker, the Surviving Entity or any
of its Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the prior written consent
of the Representative. This Section 9.8 is for the benefit of the Seller
Related Parties and each Prior Company Counsel, and the Seller Related Parties
and each Prior Company Counsel are intended third party beneficiaries of this
Section 9.8. This Section 9.8 shall survive the Closing indefinitely, shall be
irrevocable, and no term of this Section 9.8 may be amended, waived or
modified, without the prior written consent of the Representative and the
Prior Company Counsel affected thereby. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges that it has had adequate opportunity to consult with counsel of
its choosing, and has consulted with such counsel, in connection with its
decision to agree to the terms of this Section 9.8.

9.9. Confidentiality. Parent and Merger Sub will treat, and will cause their
respective Affiliates, counsel, accountants and other advisors and
representatives to treat, all nonpublic information obtained in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions as confidential in accordance with
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. The terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement are hereby incorporated by reference and will continue in full force
and effect until the Closing, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement
will terminate. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement will continue in full force and effect
as provided in Section 14.2 in accordance with its terms.

9.10. Restrictive Covenants.

two years following the Closing Date, such Seller shall not disclose or use,

 directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information (as defined below) except

the disclosure of Confidential Information is required by any Legal
Requirement, such Seller agrees to use such Seller's commercially reasonable
efforts to provide Parent an opportunity to object, at its sole expense, to

investors are bound by confidentiality obligations with respect to such
disclosure and information or (v) to representatives of such Seller and its
Affiliates who have a need to know in connection with any of the foregoing.
For purposes of this Section 9.10.1, "Confidential Information" means all
confidential or proprietary information of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any Seller relating to the Business or the property and assets
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; provided, that "Confidential
Information" shall not include information which (i) has been, is or becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure in
violation of such Seller's obligations under this Section 9.10.1, (ii)
information that was or is independently developed by such Seller or any of

induce, or attempt to solicit or induce, whether or not for consideration, any
employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary listed on Schedule 9.10.2 to
terminate or abandon his or her employment with the Company or any Company
Subsidiary; provided, however, that the foregoing restrictions shall not
restrict a Seller's right to (i) solicit any employee whose employment is
terminated by Parent or the Company or who has not been employed by the
Company for the nine month period prior to the date of such

 solicitation or hiring, (ii) hire any individual not solicited in violation of
this Section 9.10.2 or (iii) conduct general solicitations for employees or
public advertisements of employment opportunities (including general
solicitations in any local, regional or national newspapers or other
publications or circulars or on internet sites or any search firm engagement)
that are not directed or focused specifically on employees of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary.

9.10.3. Non-Competition. Each Seller covenants and agrees for a period of 30
months following the Closing Date, that such Seller shall not, (a) directly or
indirectly, engage in any business that produces, manufactures, or distributes
automotive glass, including windshields, backlites, sidelites and sunroofs for
automobiles, trucks and vans to Original Equipment Manufacturers or
Aftermarket customers (the "Restricted Business"), in any territory or
jurisdiction where the Company or any Company Subsidiary conducts the
Restricted Business as of the date of this Agreement, or (b) disparage
publicly or in the media (or privately to customers or suppliers of the
Business) the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or their respective
management, operations, business, products or employees; provided, that (x)
the acquisition and/or ownership of up to 20% of any class of securities of
any Person engaged in a Restricted Business shall not be deemed to be a
violation of the provisions of the foregoing clause (a), and (y) commencing an
Action, making court filings, providing testimony or documents or taking other
actions necessary in connection with, or incident to, the defense or
prosecution of any Action in which the interests of such Seller are adverse to
Parent, the Company, or any Company Subsidiary (including, any Action arising
from or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions or other documents and
agreements entered into in connection with the Agreement) shall not be deemed
to be a violation of the provisions of the foregoing clause (b).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, this Section 9.10 is
not binding on and shall not apply to: (A) any mergers and acquisitions
activities (including any divestiture) involving PPG Industries, Inc. or any
of its Affiliates, including the taking of an ownership interest in, all or
any part of any Person or business that is engaged in a Restricted Business or
including receiving a note from, or giving a loan to any entity that purchases
assets and/or stock from PPG Industries, Inc. and/or its Affiliates and is,
directly or indirectly, engaged in a Restricted Business, so long as either
(x) PPG Industries, Inc. and/or its applicable Affiliate does not take a
direct controlling interest in the entity conducting the Restricted Business,
or (y) the Restricted Business conducted by such acquired business represents
less than 25% of the revenues of the of the acquired business for its most

indirectly engaged in a Restricted Business; or (D) the interest currently
held directly or indirectly by PPG Industries, Inc. in Belletech Corp. For

 controlling interest means the right to appoint a majority of the board of
directors of the entity conducting the Restricted Business.

9.10.4. Limitation. This Section 9.10 is not binding on and shall not be
deemed to restrict the business activities of any investment fund that is
Affiliated with a Kohlberg Seller (unless such investment fund is itself a
Seller) or any portfolio company of any Kohlberg Seller or investment fund
Affiliated with any Kohlberg Seller.

9.10.5. Interim Relief. Each Seller for itself solely, acknowledges and agrees
that damages alone would be an insufficient remedy for Parent, the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, and that Parent, the Company, and the Company
Subsidiaries would suffer irreparable injury, if such Seller violates any
applicable provision of this Section 9.10. Accordingly, Parent, the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, upon application to a court of competent jurisdiction,
will be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of this
Section 9.10. Parent's, the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' right to
injunctive relief pursuant to this Section 9.10 will be in addition to any
other remedies they may have at law or in equity.

9.10.6. Reasonable Limitations. Each Seller, Parent, and the Company
understand and believe that the limitations as to time, geographical area and
scope of activity contained in this Section 9.10 are reasonable and necessary
to protect the legitimate interests of Parent, the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and the Company Joint Ventures and constitute a material
inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement and consummate the
Transactions. In the event that any covenant contained in this Section 9.10
should ever be adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or service,
or other limitations permitted by applicable Legal Requirements in any
jurisdiction, then any court is expressly empowered to reform such covenant,
and such covenant shall be deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the
maximum time, geographic, product or service, or other limitations permitted
by applicable Legal Requirements. The covenants contained in this Section 9.10
and each provision hereof are severable and distinct covenants and provisions.
The invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as
written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants
or provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or
provision in any other jurisdiction.

9.11. Release. Effective as of the Closing, each Seller, on behalf of itself
and its controlled Affiliates (other than (A) any portfolio company of any
Seller that is an investment fund solely with respect to any arms' length
ordinary course of business activities and (B) Blocker, the Company and the

Company Class A Units or the Purchased Securities by such Seller or (ii) any
Contractual Obligation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that does not
continue after the Closing; provided, however, that nothing contained in this
Section 9.11 will be interpreted to release any Released Party from any claims

or certificate contemplated hereby, (b) if such Releasing Party was an
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to Closing, relating
to compensation or benefits under any Company Plan of the Company or any

cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to make an election under
Revenue Procedure 2011-29, to treat 70% of any success based fees that were
paid by or on behalf of the Company as an amount that did not facilitate the
Transactions and, therefore, treat 70% of such costs as deductible in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period that ends on the Closing Date to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements. The Company shall make a Section 754 election
on the federal income Tax Return for the period that ends on the Closing Date
if such election is not then currently in effect (and any corresponding
election available under applicable state or local income Tax law).

12.2.4. The allocation of any Tax, Tax refund, or Tax benefit attributable to
a Straddle Period shall be determined (x) in the case of any Taxes based on or
measured by income, receipts, proceeds, activities, gain or similar items, by
closing the books of the Company, Blocker and the Company Subsidiaries as of
the close of business on the Closing Date, provided, however, that any item
determined on an annual or periodic basis (such as deductions for depreciation
or real estate Taxes) shall be apportioned on a daily basis, and (y) in the
case of all other Taxes, by multiplying such Taxes by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of days from the beginning of such taxable period
through the close of business on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the total number of days in such taxable period.

12.2.5. Parent shall promptly notify the Representative upon receipt by Parent
or any Affiliate of Parent (including the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) of written notice of any Tax Matter that could result in Tax
imposed on the Company Members (or their beneficial owners) with respect to
the Company or

 the Company Subsidiaries. Parent and the Representative shall have the right
to share joint control over the conduct and settlement of any Tax Matter that
could result in Tax imposed on the Company Members (or their beneficial
owners) with respect to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries. In any case
where Parent and the Representative control jointly the conduct and settlement
of any Tax Matter (or portion or aspect thereof): (i) neither Parent nor the
Representative shall accept or enter into any settlement of such Tax Matter
(or the relevant portion or aspect thereof) without the consent of the other
party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, (ii) both Parent
and the Representative shall have a right to review and consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, to any correspondence or
filings to be submitted to any Taxing Authority or Governmental Authority with
respect to such Tax Matter (or the relevant portion or aspect thereof) and
(iii) both Parent and the Representative shall have the right to attend any
formally scheduled meetings with any Taxing Authority or Governmental
Authority or hearings or proceedings before any judicial authority, in each
case with respect to such Tax Matter (or the relevant portion or aspect
thereof).

12.2.6. No election under Section 336(e) or 338(g) of the Code, or any similar
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Legal Requirements, may be made with
respect to the Purchased Securities.

12.2.7. Promptly following the Effective Time, an independent "Big Four"
accounting firm and a nationally recognized commercial real estate firm (or
such other Persons as Parent and the Representative mutually agree) (the
"Appraiser") will be jointly engaged by Parent and the Representative to
determine the fair market value of the assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (the "Appraisal"). The Appraiser will be instructed to deliver
the Appraisal to Parent and the Representative within 120 days after the
Effective Time and both Parent and the Representative will have 30 days from
receipt of the Appraisal to provide comments to the Appraiser. The Appraiser
will consider any such comments and finalize the Appraisal within such 30 day
period or, if later, five Business Days after receiving any comments from
Parent or the Representative thereto. Within five Business Days of its receipt
of the final Appraisal, Parent will prepare and deliver to the Representative
an allocation of the purchase price (as determined for Tax purposes) among the
assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries based on the final
Appraisal (the "Allocation") and in a manner consistent with the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Unless the Representative objects
to such Allocation within 15 Business Days of its receipt thereof, the
Allocation shall be considered final. All costs of the Appraisal will be borne
by Parent. Each of Parent, the Company and the Representative shall promptly
notify each other of any substantive written or electronic communication it or
its Affiliates receive from the Appraiser in connection with the Appraisal
(together with copies thereof). None of Parent, the Company or the
Representative will participate in any substantive meeting or other
substantive discussions with the Appraiser in respect of the Appraisal unless
it gives such other parties the opportunity to attend and participate at such
meeting or in such other

 discussions. Parent and the Representative shall (i) have the right to review
drafts of the Appraisal and (ii) have access to the Appraiser and will be
entitled to discuss the Appraisal process and the Appraisal (and drafts
thereof) with the Appraiser. However, if, after the procedures described in
this Section 12.2.7 have been satisfied, the parties cannot agree on the final
Allocation, then the Allocation shall be submitted to the Arbitrator for
resolution, and the procedures set forth in Section 3.7.2 with respect to the
Arbitrator shall apply mutatis mutandis. The parties shall file all relevant
Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the final Allocation and shall not
take any position inconsistent with the final Allocation, unless otherwise
required by applicable Legal Requirements.

12.3. Representative.

12.3.5. As an integral component of the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Merger, the Representative is hereby irrevocably appointed, authorized
and empowered as the representative of the Equityholders, Blocker Seller and
their respective successors and permitted assigns for the purposes specified
in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and all actions taken by the
Representative hereunder and thereunder will be binding upon all such
Equityholders, Blocker Seller and their respective successors. The
Representative may take any and all actions which it believes are necessary or
appropriate in connection with the purposes for which it serves as the
Representative as specified in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement for and
on behalf of the Equityholders and Blocker Seller, including, without
limitation, approving or contesting the determination of the Total Equity
Value and the Blocker Adjustment (or any elements thereof) pursuant to Section
3.7 and all actions in connection with any distributions to be made in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 3.8, consenting to, compromising or settling all
claims and matters in connection with such determination or distributions,
conducting negotiations with Parent and other applicable counterparties and
their agents regarding claims and matters in connection with such
determination or distributions, dealing with Parent, the Surviving Entity and
its Subsidiaries, and the Escrow Agent, under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, as applicable, in connection with such determination or
distributions, and engaging counsel, accountants or other representatives on
behalf of the Equityholders and Blocker Seller in connection with the
foregoing matters. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Representative will have full power and authority on behalf of the
Equityholders and Blocker Seller to interpret all of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement in connection with the
determination of the Total Equity Value and the Blocker Adjustment (or any
elements thereof) pursuant to Section 3.7 and all actions in connection with
any distributions to be made in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.8 and to
consent to any waiver of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, or any
amendment of the Escrow Agreement, in each case on behalf of all such
Equityholders and Blocker Seller and their respective successors and permitted
assigns in connection with the determination of the Total Equity Value and the
Blocker Adjustment (or any elements thereof) pursuant to Section 3.7 and all
actions in connection with any distributions to be made in respect

 thereof pursuant to Section 3.8; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
this Agreement may only be amended or modified in accordance with Section
15.2. The Representative hereby accepts such appointment.

12.3.6. Without limiting Section 12.3.1, the Representative is the
representative of the Equityholders and Blocker Seller and can act as the true
and lawful agent of the Equityholders and Blocker Seller and attorney-in-fact
with respect to all matters arising in connection with the determination of
the Total Equity Value and the Blocker Adjustment (or any elements thereof)
pursuant to Section 3.7 and all actions in connection with any distributions
to be made in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.8, including but not
limited to the power and authority on behalf of each Equityholder and Blocker
Seller to do any one or all of the following in connection with such
determination or distributions:

12.3.6.4. give any written notices or consents and seek any declaratory
judgments, damages or other appropriate relief from a court or other tribunal
that the Representative may consider necessary or appropriate in connection
with such determination or distribution;

12.3.6.5. give any written direction to the Escrow Agent as the Representative
may consider necessary or appropriate in connection with such determination or
distribution;

12.3.6.6. make, execute and deliver such amendments of the Escrow Agreement,
or supplements to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, or amendments of
and supplements to any other agreements, instruments or documents relating
hereto that the Representative may consider necessary or appropriate in
connection with such determination or distribution, such authority to be
conclusively evidenced by the execution and delivery thereof (provided that,
withstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may only be amended or modified in
accordance with Section 15.2); and

12.3.6.7. take all actions and do all things (including but not limited to the
execution and delivery of all documents necessary or proper, required,
contemplated or deemed advisable by the Representative, serving and receiving
process, and commencing, controlling, defending, compromising or settling
Actions) that are in the opinion of the Representative necessary or
appropriate in connection with, and to act for and in the name of each such
Equityholder and Blocker Seller with respect to, such determination and
distributions.

12.3.7. All Representative Expenses (including reasonable attorneys' and
experts' fees and expenses) incurred by the Representative will first be paid
or reimbursed out of the Representative Expense Fund; provided, however that
if any fees and expenses paid or costs incurred by the Representative on
behalf of any

 Equityholder or Blocker Seller exceeds such Equityholder's or Blocker Seller's
Pro Rata Share of the cash held in the Representative Expense Fund at such
time, such excess amount will be promptly reimbursed to the Representative by
such Equityholder (or, in the case of the Company Optionholders, to the
Surviving Entity for further distribution to each of the Company
Optionholders, subject to Section 3.9, through the Company's payroll system)
or Blocker Seller (or, at the election of the Representative, deducted from
any release to such Equityholder or Blocker Seller from the Adjustment Escrow
Account pursuant to Section 3.8). The Representative will have authority to
disburse and pay amounts placed into the Representative Expense Fund and
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates will have any recourse to or other
rights in respect of the Representative Expense Fund. At such time as the
Representative determines (in its sole discretion) that all or a portion of
the Representative Expense Fund will not be needed to pay Representative
Expenses, the Representative will cause such portion of the Representative
Expense Fund to be paid to the Equityholders (or, in the case of the Company
Optionholders, to the Surviving Entity for further distribution to each of the
Company Optionholders, subject to Section 3.9, through the Company's payroll
system) and Blocker Seller (in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Shares). All contributions to and disbursements from the Representative
Expense Fund will be made by Equityholders and Blocker Seller or to
Equityholders (or, in the case of the Company Optionholders, to the Surviving
Entity for further distribution to each of the Company Optionholders, subject
to Section 3.9, through the Company's payroll system) or Blocker Seller, as
the case may be, based on their respective Pro Rata Shares of the total amount
to be so contributed or distributed. If at any time the aggregate amount of
Representative Expenses exceeds or, in the Representative's good faith
judgment, may in the future exceed the amount then held by the Representative
in the Representative Expense Fund, the Representative will be entitled to
establish such reserves as the Representative may determine, in its sole
discretion, to be necessary and desirable in connection with the
Representative Expenses and any other expenses and costs to be borne by the
Representative on behalf of the Equityholders and Blocker Seller under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, and may, after the final determination of
the Closing Working Capital Amount, the Closing Debt, the Final Transaction
Expenses, the Closing Cash and the Blocker Adjustment, and payment of any
amounts due to Parent following such determination pursuant to Section 3.7.2,
direct the Escrow Agent to make payment of such amounts to be applied to such
reserves in lieu of any payment to the Equityholders and Blocker Seller
hereunder (in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares) out of the
cash held in the Adjustment Escrow Account that is otherwise being distributed
to the Equityholders and Blocker Seller.

12.3.8. At any time during the term of the Escrow Agreement, a majority-in-
interest of Equityholders and Blocker Seller may, by written consent, appoint
a new representative as the Representative. Notice, together with a copy of
the written consent appointing such new representative and bearing the
signatures of Equityholders and Blocker Seller of a majority-in-interest of
those Equityholders and Blocker Seller, must be delivered to Parent and, if
applicable, the Escrow Agent not

 less than ten days prior to such appointment. Such appointment will be
effective upon the later of the date indicated in the consent or ten days
after the date such consent is received by Parent and, if applicable, the
Escrow Agent. For the purposes of this Section 12.3.4, a "majority-in-interest
of the Equityholders and Blocker Seller" means those Persons entitled to in
the aggregate over 50% of the total consideration paid or payable hereunder as
of the time of determination.

12.3.9. In the event that the Representative becomes unable or unwilling to
continue in its capacity as the Representative, or if the Representative
resigns as such, a majority-in-interest of the Equityholders and Blocker
Seller may, by written consent, appoint a new Representative. Notice and a
copy of the written consent appointing such new Representative and bearing the
signatures of a majority-in-interest of the Equityholders and Blocker Seller
must be delivered to Parent and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent. Such
appointment will be effective upon the later of the date indicated in the
consent or the date such consent is received by Parent and, if applicable, the
Escrow Agent.

12.3.10. The Representative will not be liable to any Equityholder or Blocker
Seller for any action taken by the Representative in good faith pursuant to
this Section 12.3, and each Equityholder and Blocker Seller will indemnify and
hold harmless (but only to the extent of his, her or its Pro Rata Share of any
liability) the Representative from any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
fines, penalties, judgments, amounts paid in settlement, interest, costs and
expenses (including the fees, costs and expenses of counsel and experts)
arising out of it serving as the Representative hereunder. The Representative
is serving in that capacity solely for purposes of administrative convenience,
and is not and will not be personally liable in such capacity for any of the
payment obligations to be funded by the cash held in the Adjustment Escrow
Account, and each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees the personal assets of the
Representative, acting in such capacity, will not in any way be a source for
the satisfaction of any obligations under this Agreement or otherwise related
to the Transactions, including obligations to be funded by the cash held in
the Adjustment Escrow Account.

12.3.11. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement, no Equityholder or Blocker Seller shall have any
right to, or any interest or claim relating to the Adjustment Escrow Amount or
Representative Expense Fund unless and until it has been finally determined in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement that such funds or other property are to be distributed to such
Equityholder or Blocker Seller in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, as applicable.

12.3.12. Parent, Merger Sub and the Escrow Agent shall be able to rely
conclusively on the instructions and decisions of the Representative as to the
settlement of any claims against the Adjustment Escrow Amount pursuant to the
Escrow

 Agreement or as to any actions required or permitted to be taken by the
Representative hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement. The Representative
hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that (i) it has been
duly formed and is validly existing as a limited liability company under the
laws of the State of Delaware, (ii) it has all requisite power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and to take all
actions contemplated to be taken by the Representative hereunder and
thereunder, (iii) the execution and delivery by the Representative of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the performance by the Representative
of its obligations hereunder and thereunder do not and will not conflict with
or violate any provision of any Legal Requirement applicable to, or the
Organizational Documents of, the Representative, and (iv) no authorization,
consent, approval or other order of, declaration to, or filing with, any
Person or Governmental Authority by or on behalf of the Representative is
required for or in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement by the Representative or the performance of
its obligations hereunder except for such authorizations, consents, approvals,
orders, declarations, or filings, that, in the aggregate, would not have a
material adverse effect on the ability of the Representative to perform its
obligations hereunder.

or the subject matter of this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such
court, (iii) agrees not to commence any such action, proceeding or suit other
than before one of the above-named courts nor to make any motion or take any
other action seeking or intending to cause the transfer or removal of any such

of process in any such action, proceeding or suit shall be good and
sufficient. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party may commence an action,
proceeding or suit in any jurisdiction to enforce an order or judgment of one
of the above-named courts.

 13.2. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LEGAL

EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY.

13.3. Attorneys' Fees and Expenses. In the event any party brings an action to
enforce or determine any rights under this Agreement or the Transactions, the

order the non-prevailing party to pay the reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys'
fees and expenses incurred by the prevailing party and, promptly after the
entry of a final and nonappealable order of such court to such effect, the
non-prevailing party shall pay to the prevailing party all such costs and
expenses.

consent at any time prior to the Closing.

14.1.14. Parent may terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice to
the Company and Blocker Seller at any time prior to the Closing in the event

Section 6 or Section 7 shall not be true and correct, or if the Company or any
Seller has failed to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of the
Company or any Seller set forth in this Agreement, in either case, such that a
condition to Closing set forth in Section 10 would not be satisfied and the
breach or breaches causing such representations or warranties not to be true
and correct, or the failures to perform any such covenant or agreement, as
applicable, are not cured within 20 Business Days after written notice thereof
is delivered to the Company; provided, that Parent or Merger Sub are not then
in breach of this Agreement so as to cause a condition to Closing set forth in
Section 11 not to be satisfied.

14.1.15. The Company may terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice
to Parent at any time prior to the Closing in the event any of the
representations or warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 8
shall not be true and correct, or if Parent or Merger Sub has failed to
perform any covenant or

 agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, in
each case, such that the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 11 would
not be satisfied and the breach or breaches causing such representations or
warranties not to be true and correct, or the failures to perform any such
covenant or agreement, as applicable, are not cured within 20 Business Days
after written notice thereof is delivered to Parent; provided, that the
Company is not then in breach of this Agreement so as to cause a condition to
Closing set forth in Section 10 not to be satisfied.

14.1.16. Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, may
terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to the other at any time
on or after June 27, 2016 if the Transactions have not been consummated by

Section 14.1.4 has not (provided that, if such party is Parent, neither Parent
nor Merger Sub has or if such party is Company, none of the Company, Blocker
or any Seller has) breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements under this Agreement in any manner that has proximately caused
the failure to consummate the Transactions on or before such date.

14.1.17. Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, may

nonappealable.

14.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 14.1, all obligations of the parties hereunder will
terminate without any further liability of any party to any other party,
except that (i) the provisions of this Section 14.2 and Section 15 (other than
the provisions of Section 15.11) shall survive termination of this Agreement
and (ii) nothing herein will relieve any party hereto from any liability for
intentional fraud based on the express representations and warranties in this
Agreement or any willful and material breach of the provisions of this
Agreement prior to such termination (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will
be deemed to include any failure by a party to consummate the Transactions if
it is obliged to do so hereunder). In addition, no termination of this
Agreement will affect the obligations contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, all of which obligations will survive termination of this Agreement
in accordance with their terms.

MISCELLANEOUS. 

15.1. Entire Agreement; Waivers. This Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto, the Escrow Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement among the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings,
negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the parties with
respect to such subject matter; provided, however, nothing in this Agreement
supersedes any obligations of PPG Industries, Inc. or the Company under that
certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated July 3, 2008, as amended prior to the
date hereof, among PPG Industries, Inc., the Company and certain other
parties, solely to the extent that any such obligations

 continue to exist pursuant to the terms of such agreement. No waiver of any
provision of this Agreement will be deemed or will constitute a waiver of any
other provision hereof (whether or not similar), will constitute a continuing
waiver unless otherwise expressly provided nor will be effective unless in
writing and executed by the party making such waiver.

15.2. Amendment or Modification. The parties hereto may amend or modify this
Agreement only by a written instrument executed by each of the parties hereto.

15.3. Severability. In the event that any provision hereof is held by any
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unenforceable in any respect, such provision will be construed by modifying or
limiting it so as to be valid and enforceable to the maximum extent possible.
The provisions hereof are severable, and in the event any provision hereof
should be held invalid or unenforceable in any respect, it will not
invalidate, render unenforceable or otherwise affect any other provision
hereof.

15.4. Successors and Assigns. No assignment by any party hereto will be
permitted without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and
any such attempted assignment without consent will be null and void, and no
permitted assignment by any party will relieve such party of any of its

hereunder will be deemed to have been properly given and delivered if in

Each of the parties hereto will be entitled to specify a different address by
delivering notice as aforesaid to each of the other parties hereto.

15.6. Public Announcements. Prior to Closing, no party hereto will issue or
make any report, statement or release to the public (including, before
Closing, the employees, customers and suppliers of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries) with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions without the
consent of the Parent and the Company, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed (it being understood that Parent consents to
the disclosure of this Agreement or the Transactions to any Person for which
Parent requests consent pursuant to Section 9.2.2), except as such release or
announcement may be required by any Legal Requirement or the rules or
regulations of any stock exchange or applicable Governmental

 Authority to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall provide the other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance and shall reasonably consider in good faith any such comments, it
being understood that the final form and content of any such release or
announcement, to the extent so required, shall be at the final discretion of
the disclosing party. If any party hereto is unable to obtain, after
reasonable effort, the approval of its public report, statement or release
from the other parties hereto and such report, statement or release is, in the
opinion of legal counsel to such party, required by any Legal Requirement in
order to discharge such party's disclosure obligations, then such party may
make or issue the legally required report, statement or release and promptly
furnish the other parties with a copy thereof.

15.7. Headings. Section and subsection headings are not to be considered part
of this Agreement, are included solely for convenience, are not intended to be
full or accurate descriptions of the content thereof, are not intended to
define, limit or describe the scope or intent of this Agreement, and will not
affect the construction, meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

15.8. Disclosure. Any item listed or referred to in any Schedule pursuant to
any Section of this Agreement will be deemed to have been listed in or
incorporated by reference into any other Schedule to the extent that the
applicability of the information disclosed to such other representation and
warranty or Schedule is reasonably apparent on the face of the Schedule. The
headings, if any, of the individual sections of each of the Schedules are
inserted for convenience only and will not be deemed to constitute a part
thereof or a part of the Agreement. The inclusion of an item in the Schedules
as an exception to a representation or warranty will not be deemed an
admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by virtue of the
inclusion of such information in the Schedules, that such information is
required to be listed in the Schedules or that such item (or any non-disclosed
item or information of comparable or greater significance) represents a
material exception or fact, event or circumstance, that such item has had, or
is excepted to result in, a Material Adverse Effect, or that such item
actually constitutes noncompliance with, or a violation of, any Legal
Requirement or Contractual Obligation or other topic to which such disclosure
is applicable.

15.9. Counterparts. This Agreement and any claims related to the subject
matter hereof may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which
will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute but one
and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature
page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic imaging means will be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

15.10. Governing Law. Subject to Section 3.7, this Agreement and its subject
matter, and any action, proceeding or suit (at law or in equity, in contract,
tort or otherwise) arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the
subject matter hereof will be governed by and construed and enforced in
accordance with laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any
choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would result in the
application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

15.11. Specific Performance. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that
the other parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement were

 not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached or violated. Accordingly, each of the parties agrees that, without
posting bond or other undertaking, the other parties will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or violations of the provisions
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money
damages as a remedy and without bond or other security being required, in
addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity,
it being agreed that remedies hereunder are cumulative. Each of the parties
hereto hereby acknowledges and agrees that it may be difficult to prove
damages with reasonable certainty, that it may be difficult to procure
suitable substitute performance and that injunctive relief and/or specific
performance will not cause an undue hardship to the parties. Each of the
parties hereto hereby further acknowledges and agrees that the existence of
any other remedy contemplated by this Agreement does not diminish the
availability of injunctive relief or specific performance. Each party further
agrees that, in the event of any action, proceeding or suit for injunctive
relief or specific performance, it will not assert the defense that a remedy
at law would be adequate, that the party seeking such relief would not be
irreparably harmed absent such relief, or that specific performance or
injunctive relief should not be available on the grounds that money damages
are adequate or any other grounds.

15.12. No Third-Party Beneficiaries; No Recourse Against Third Parties.

15.12.1. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and
their successors and permitted assigns, and nothing express or implied herein
will give to or impose on, or be construed to give to or impose on, any
Person, other than to such parties and to such successors and permitted
assigns, any legal or equitable rights or remedies or any liabilities or
obligations, other than (i) the Equityholders with respect to the provisions
of Section 3, (ii) as set forth in Sections 9.6 and 9.8, and (iii) the Persons
benefitted by Sections 15.12.2, 15.12.3 and 15.14, respectively. Each of the
Persons described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the immediately preceding
sentence is and shall be an intended third party beneficiary with respect to
the applicable Section(s) specified in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the
immediately preceding sentence, and may enforce this Agreement with respect to
such Section(s).

15.12.2. Parent and Merger Sub will not, and will not cause or permit any
controlled Affiliate thereof to, (i) assert any claim of any nature whatsoever
arising under or relating to this Agreement, the negotiation thereof or its
subject matter, or the Transactions, against any Person other than the Company
and Sellers (and against the Company and Sellers (solely with respect to the
Specified Equityholder Sections) only pursuant to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement), including without limitation against any of the Company's or
any Seller's respective past, present or future direct or indirect
Equityholders and Blocker Seller, or any partners, members, stockholders,
controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, incorporators, managers,
agents, representatives, or Affiliates of the Company or any Seller (or any
Affiliate of any of the foregoing), or the heirs, executors, administrators,
estates, successors or assigns of any of the foregoing (each a "Nonparty
Seller Affiliate") or (ii) without limiting the generality of clause (i), hold
or attempt to hold any Nonparty Seller Affiliate liable for

 any actual or alleged inaccuracies, misstatements or omissions with respect to
any information or materials of any kind furnished by the Company, Blocker,
any Seller or any Nonparty Seller Affiliate, or their respective
representatives or agents, concerning the Business, the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, Blocker, any Seller, this Agreement or the Transactions.

15.12.3. Sellers will not, and will not cause or permit any controlled
Affiliate thereof to, (i) assert any claim of any nature whatsoever arising
under or relating to this Agreement, the negotiation thereof or its subject
matter, or the Transactions, against any Person other than the Parent and
Merger Sub (and against the Parent and Merger Sub only pursuant to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement), including without limitation against any of
the Parent's or Merger Sub's respective past, present or future direct or
indirect equityholders, or any partners, members, stockholders, controlling
persons, directors, officers, employees, incorporators, managers, agents,
representatives, or Affiliates of the Parent or Merger Sub (or any Affiliate
of any of the foregoing), or the heirs, executors, administrators, estates,
successors or assigns of any of the foregoing (each a "Nonparty Parent
Affiliate" and collectively, with each Nonparty Seller Affiliate, the
"Nonparty Affiliates") or (ii) without limiting the generality of clause (i),
hold or attempt to hold any Nonparty Parent Affiliate liable for any actual or
alleged inaccuracies, misstatements or omissions with respect to any
information or materials of any kind furnished by the Parent, Merger Sub, or
any Nonparty Parent Affiliate, or their respective representatives or agents,
concerning the Parent, Merger Sub, this Agreement or the Transactions.

15.12.4. It is expressly acknowledged, understood and agreed that nothing
herein is intended to, does or will constitute an amendment to or
establishment of any employee benefit or other plan.

15.13. Negotiation of Agreement; Expenses. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges and agrees that it has been represented by independent counsel of
its choice throughout all negotiations that have preceded the execution of
this Agreement and that it has executed the same with consent and upon the
advice of said independent counsel. Each party hereto and its counsel
cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the documents
referred to herein, and none shall be construed more strictly against any
party. Whether or not the Transactions are consummated, except as otherwise
specifically provided for in this Agreement, each party will assume, bear, and
pay all costs, expenses and fees (including legal and accounting fees and
expenses) incurred by such party in connection with the preparation,
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions; provided that, if the
Closing occurs, all such costs, expenses and fees of the Company (incurred
through the Closing) and the Representative shall be considered Transaction
Expenses.

15.14. Acknowledgement. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, EACH OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT: (i) IT HAS CONDUCTED, TO ITS

 SATISFACTION, AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION AND VERIFICATION OF THE CONDITION
