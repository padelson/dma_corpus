ARTICLE VI 

_Representations and Warranties of Sellers_

As of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date (unless otherwise indicated
herein), each Seller individually represents and warrants, severally, but not
jointly, to Buyer and only to the extent that the following representations
and warranties pertain to Companies in which such Seller has an ownership
interest, as follows:

Section 6.1 _Organizational Matters Regarding, and Legal Capacity of, Sellers,
the Seller Affiliates and the Companies_. 

(a) _Organization and Qualification; Power_. Each of Westwood Tall Oaks and
the Companies is a corporation or limited liability company duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing, if applicable, under the Laws of its
jurisdiction of organization. Schedule 6.1(a) sets forth (i) the state that is
the principal residence of each Seller and the jurisdiction of organization
of Westwood Tall Oaks, (ii) the state of organization of each of the Companies
and (iii) the states in which each of the Companies is qualified or licensed
as a foreign corporation. Westwood Tall Oaks and each Company is duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing as a foreign corporation or limited
liability company in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes
such qualification necessary, except where failure to be so qualified or
licensed would not have or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Companies or Sellers (within 



 

28  the meaning of clause (ii) of the definition thereof). Each Company has all
requisite corporate or limited liability company power and authority to own,
lease and operate its assets, and to carry on its Business. Sellers have
furnished to Buyer true, complete and correct copies of the Charter Documents
for each of the Companies, each as amended to date.

(b) _Authority; Validity_. Each of Sellers and the Seller Affiliates that are
parties to the Ancillary Agreements have all requisite legal capacity and CRC,
PRRC and Westwood Tall Oaks have all requisite corporate or limited liability
company power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which he or it is a party, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and to perform his or its
obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Westwood Tall Oaks, CRC, PRRC and each Seller Affiliate (in the
case of Westwood Tall Oaks) and of the documents and instruments to be
executed by Westwood Tall Oaks, CRC, PRRC or each Seller Affiliate pursuant
hereto (including the Ancillary Agreements) and the performance of the
transactions contemplated hereunder and of its obligations thereunder have
been duly authorized by Westwood Tall Oaks, CRC, PRRC or such Seller
Affiliate, as the case may be. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by CRC, PRRC and each Seller and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer, constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of CRC, PRRC and each Seller enforceable against each
of them in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors rights
generally or (ii) general principles of equity (regardless whether
enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity). At Closing,
each of the Ancillary Agreements will be duly executed and delivered by CRC,
PRRC and each Seller or Seller Affiliate party thereto, and assuming due
authentication, execution and delivery of such Ancillary Agreements by the
other parties thereto (other than CRC, PRRC and the Seller or Seller
Affiliate party thereto), will constitute legally valid and binding
obligations of CRC, PRRC and each Seller and Seller Affiliate party thereto,
enforceable against such Person in accordance with such Ancillary Agreements
or other agreements or documents terms, except as such enforceability may
be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors rights
generally or (ii) general principles of equity (regardless whether
enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity). The board
of directors and shareholders of CRC have approved the First Merger, this
Agreement and the related First Merger Plan of Merger. The board of directors
and shareholders of PRRC have approved the Second Merger, this Agreement and
the related Second Merger Plan of Merger. Other than final approval of the
First Merger Plan of Merger and the Second Merger Plan of Merger by the board
of directors and shareholders of CRC and PRRC, respectively, once Buyers Sub
1 and Buyers Sub 2 are formed by Buyer, which approval RG, MG, CRC and PRRC
agree to cause, no further act or proceeding on the part of any Seller is
necessary to authorize this Agreement and the related Plans of Merger or the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party or the performance of its
obligations hereunder or thereunder.

(c) _Compliance; Binding Effect_. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, the Articles of Merger and each other
agreement to be delivered in connection herewith and therewith by CRC, PRRC
and each Seller or Seller Affiliate party thereto, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by Articles II, III and IV hereof and
otherwise contemplated hereby and thereby and compliance with the 



 

29  provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements will not: (i)
violate any provision of the Charter Documents of Westwood Tall Oaks, any of
the Companies or the Seller Affiliates; (ii) other than as set forth in
Schedule 6.1(c)(ii), constitute a breach or violation of, or default under, or
give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or creation or accelerate
any obligation, or create an Encumbrance on any assets, properties or rights
of any Company, Seller or Seller Affiliate (with or without notice, lapse of
time or both) pursuant to, any Material Identified Contract binding upon any
Company, Seller or Seller Affiliate or to which any of their
respective properties or assets are bound; or (iii) violate or conflict with
any Law or Judgment to which any Company, Seller or Seller Affiliate or any of
their respective properties or assets is subject or by which any Company,
Seller or Seller Affiliate, or any of their respective properties or assets
is bound, excluding from the foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii) such breaches,
violations, defaults, accelerations, conflicts or rights (A) that, would
neither have or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Companies nor materially adversely affect the ability of CRC, PRRC or any
Seller or Seller Affiliate to perform its obligations hereunder or (B) that
become applicable as a result of (x) the business or activities in which
Buyer, A.T. Massey Sub, Buyers Sub 1 or Buyers Sub 2 or any of their
Affiliates is or proposes to be engaged or (y) any acts or omissions by, or
facts pertaining to, Buyer, A.T. Massey Sub, Buyers Sub 1, Buyers Sub 2 or

such representations and warranties shall be effective immediately upon

authority to own, lease and operate its assets, and to carry on its Business.

and Buyers Sub 2\. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Buyer, A.T. Massey Sub, Buyers Sub 1 and Buyers Sub 2 and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Sellers,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer, A.T. Massey Sub,
Buyers Sub 1 and Buyers Sub 2 enforceable against them in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (i) bankruptcy,

directors and shareholders of Buyers Sub 1 and Buyers Sub 2, respectively,
once Buyers Sub 1 and Buyers Sub 2 are formed by Buyer, which approval Buyer
agrees to cause, no further act or proceeding on the part of Buyer, A.T.
Massey Sub, Buyers Sub 1 and Buyers Sub 2 is necessary to authorize this
Agreement and the related Plans of Merger or the Ancillary Agreements to which
it is a party or the performance of its obligations hereunder or thereunder.

foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii) such violations, defaults, accelerations,
conflicts or rights that would neither have or reasonably be expected to have

ability of Buyer, A.T. Massey Sub, Buyers Sub 1 or Buyers Sub 2 to perform
any of their obligations hereunder.

Section 7.2 _Consents and Approvals_. Except for the filings, permits,
authorizations, consents, approvals and/or notices required under (i) the HSR

be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer.

officers, employees, agents, attorneys, consultants, advisors or other
representatives, whether on behalf of Sellers or such other Persons. Buyer,
A.T. Massey Sub, Buyers Sub 1 and Buyers Sub 2 are unaware of any reason
why either the First Merger or the Second Merger will fail to qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368 of the Code. ALL WARRANTIES OF HABITABILITY,
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ALL
OTHER WARRANTIES ARISING UNDER THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE, ANY OTHER STATUTE
OR AT COMMON LAW ARE HEREBY WAIVED BY BUYER, A.T. MASSEY SUB, BUYERS SUB 1

thereof) is deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction,
as to that jurisdiction such Restrictive Covenant (or portion thereof) shall
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or

unenforceable in any other jurisdiction.

will deliver to Buyer copies of such Change of Control Waivers promptly after
they are obtained by Sellers. For all other Contracts set forth in Schedule

appropriate process for obtaining the Change of Control Waivers. Sellers and
the Companies shall not be required to make any payments or incur any fees or
similar expenses with respect thereto. The Parties shall keep each other aware

61 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the Parties shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Mergers to qualify, and will not

expected to prevent the Mergers from qualifying as reorganizations under the
provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of the Parties shall report
the Mergers for United States federal income tax purposes as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section of 368(a) of the Code.

(d) Sellers agree that to the extent the amount of any Intercompany Accounts

Section 8.8 _Environmental and Mining Permits_.

deliver to the applicable Governmental Entities on the Closing Date (i) all
filings, each in a form that satisfies all requirements of the applicable
Governmental Entities, that are necessary to cause the applicable Governmental
Entities to transfer to Buyer the Environmental and Mining Permits (the "
_Transfer Applications_ "); and (ii) any and all replacement bonds or other
financial security, if applicable, required to complete the transfer of the
Environmental and Mining Permits and replace the Company Bonds. The
Parties acknowledge that some Governmental Entities may not require a permit
transfer but will/may require updated ownership and control information
perhaps with a bond replacement and/or the issuance of a new license or mine
number and that any reference herein to a permit transfer shall also refer to
bond replacement and/or ownership and control information or issuance of a new
license or mine number. At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Sellers copies
of the Transfer Applications. Sellers will cooperate with Buyer in completing
all necessary forms to effect the Transfer Applications and to effect Buyers
ability to operate under Sellers permits during the Transfer Period described
below.

(b) Any Environmental and Mining Permits held and/or controlled by the
Companies and that are required to be transferred may continue to be utilized
by Buyer after Closing but shall be transferred and/or replaced, as
applicable, within the Transfer Period, _provided_ , _that_ all Company Bonds
posted under the Environmental and Mining Permits shall be replaced by Buyer
at Closing or promptly thereafter before processing the Transfer
Applications. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Transfer Period_ " shall
mean the one hundred and twenty (120) day period following the Closing Date,
except that the period shall be extended an additional sixty (60) days should
Governmental Entities delay processing and approval of Transfer Applications.
Buyer shall reimburse Sellers for any direct costs incurred by Sellers in
connection with the maintenance of such Environmental and Mining Permits or
related bonds from the Closing Date up to and including the date that such
transfers occur.

expenses or damages incurred by Sellers or their Affiliates resulting from

Mining Permit following the Closing Date but before the transfer of the
Environmental and Mining Permit, Sellers will give Buyer prompt notice
thereof. Buyer shall, at is sole expense, promptly take action to cure any

actions before, on or after the Closing Date, within the applicable abatement
period. If Sellers determine, in their reasonable discretion, that Buyer will
not cause such violation to be cured in a timely fashion, Sellers shall have
the right to cure, or cause to be cured, such violation itself in which case
Buyer shall reimburse Sellers for any and all costs, expenses and/or damages
incurred by Sellers in curing such violation. Notwithstanding any of the
foregoing, Sellers shall have the right to cure, or cause to be cured, such
violation if Sellers determine that failure to cure such violation will likely
result in Sellers being "permit-blocked" in any state or under the federal
applicant violators system in which case Buyer shall reimburse Sellers for
any and all such costs, expenses and/or damages incurred by Sellers to cure
such violations.

(e) The Parties hereto acknowledge that there are certain bonds and/or
letters of credit posted for the benefit of the Companies that are not related
to the Environmental and Mining Permits and are more particularly set out on
Schedule 8.8(e) (the " _Miscellaneous Bonds_ ") for the purpose of obtaining
workers compensation coverage. The Parties acknowledge that these
Miscellaneous Bonds shall be cancelled at Closing and not available to Buyer
post-Closing.

(f) The surety under the existing Company Bonds posted for the Environmental
and Mining Permits has certain indemnity rights under those certain
agreements set forth on Schedule 8.8(f) (the " _Bond Indemnity Agreements_ ").
Buyer, at its sole expense, shall obtain the consent of the parties to the
Bond Indemnity Agreements so that Buyer may continue to operate under
the Bond Indemnity Agreements after the Closing Date.

other rights or obligations of the Parties contained herein, for a period of

PRRC, at any time prior to or on the Effective Time, and (ii) advance
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees as incurred), in each case to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable law and the Articles of

indemnified party arising out of a claim for indemnification made by a
Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 11.3 hereof. Any determination
required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of an individual
seeking indemnification has complied with the standards set forth under
applicable law shall be made by independent counsel mutually acceptable to
Buyer and such individual.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Companies shall purchase non-
cancelable extended reporting period endorsements under their existing
Directors and officers liability insurance coverage for each such Companys
Directors and officers in substantially the same form as presently maintained
by each Company (the " _Pre-Closing D andO Policy Fees_"), which shall provide
such Directors and officers with coverage for seven (7) years following the
Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and have other
terms not less favorable to, the insured persons than the Directors and
officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by each Company.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the obligations of Buyer, the
First Merger Surviving Corporation, the Second Merger Surviving Corporation
and A.T. Massey Sub contained in this Section 8.10 shall be binding upon the
successors and assigns of Buyer, the First Merger Surviving Corporation, the

Corporation or A.T. Massey Sub or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person or (ii)

assigns of Buyer, the First Merger Surviving Corporation, the Second Merger
Surviving Corporation or A.T. Massey Sub, as the case may be, honor the
indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 8.10.

(d) After the Closing Date, the obligations of Buyer, the First Merger
Surviving Corporation, the Second Merger Surviving Corporation and A.T. Massey

agree that this release may be pleaded by the Buyer Released Parties as a
counterclaim or cross-claim to or as a defense in bar or abatement of any
Sellers Released Claim.

Section 8.12 _Financing_.

(a) The Sellers acknowledge that Buyer intends to explore financing options to
fund a portion of the Closing Cash Delivery Amount after the date of this
Agreement. In 



 

65  furtherance of such efforts, Buyer may need to provide third parties,
including investment banking firms, from whom Buyer is seeking such financing
(the " _Financing Parties_ ") certain information about the Companies that
the Sellers and the Companies have provided to Buyer in the negotiation of
this Agreement or otherwise (the " _Company Information_ "). Upon the
reasonable request of Buyer, the Sellers agree to (i) provide the Company
Information to a Financing Party upon the execution by the Financing Party of

comments or questions on any of the Audited Financial Statements, Sellers and

reasonably cooperate with Buyer, Buyers independent accountants and the SEC
to resolve any such issues and questions regarding such Audited Financial
Statements and take such commercially reasonably actions with respect to such
Audited Financial Statements as are necessary for Buyer to satisfy its
obligations under Regulation S-X. The Parties hereby agree that the receipt
of any comments or questions from the SEC or any changes to the Audited
Financial Statements made in response to such comments or questions shall in
no event create any presumption or other basis, in and of itself, for
asserting that the covenants set forth in this Section 8.12 or the
representations and warranties set forth in Article VI are breached or not
satisfied.

(d) Between the date hereof and the Closing, Sellers and the Companies shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyers reasonable
requests in connection with Buyers compliance with applicable Laws with

with SEC reporting obligations of the transactions hereunder, including the
preparation by Buyer of pro forma financial statements and addressing purchase
accounting issues and (ii) allowing access to the Companies Auditors
(including to the extent required by such accountants, consent to the release
of their work papers to Buyer or Buyers independent accountants), and
discussing with the Companies Auditors appropriate consents to fulfill
Buyers reporting requirements, including financial statements and the
notes thereto.

(e) Buyer shall, promptly upon written request by the Companies or the
Sellers, reimburse the Companies or the Sellers, as the case may be, for all
reasonable costs to the extent such costs are incurred by the Companies or
Sellers in connection with the cooperation provided by the Companies or the
Sellers pursuant to the terms of this Section 8.12 and Buyer 



 

66  shall indemnify and hold harmless the Companies and Sellers and their
respective Affiliates, Directors, managers, officers, employees, shareholders,
members and agents from and against any and all Losses (as defined herein)
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with any financing or
Sellers or the Companies actions under this Section 8.12. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Parties agree that the successful completion of any financing
by Buyer is not a condition to the Closing of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and once all other conditions to this Agreement are satisfied
or waived, if Buyer is not able to or does not deliver the Closing Cash
Delivery Amount, it shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement.

Section 8.13 _Cash and Marketable Securities_. Subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 8.1(p), Buyer consents to the distribution of book cash and
marketable securities owned by the Companies to the Sellers between the date
hereof and the Closing Date.

described in the preceding sentence prior to filing. Sellers shall reimburse
Buyer for Taxes of the Companies with respect to such periods within fifteen
(15) days after payment by Buyer or the Company of such Taxes to the extent
such Taxes are not reflected in the reserve for Tax Liability (rather than any
reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) shown on the face of the First Merger Closing Adjusted
Working Capital Statement, the LLC Closing Adjusted Working Capital Statement
or the Pre-Closing Financial Statements of any of the Companies. Sellers
shall be responsible (with Buyers cooperation as hereinafter expressly
provided) for causing the timely filing of all Income Tax Returns required by
law to be filed by the Companies with respect to periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date with respect to which the Company was a subchapter
S corporation or LLC taxed as a partnership or disregarded entity, and for
causing the timely payment of all Taxes due and payable under such Tax
Returns, and

(B) Sellers shall be responsible (with Buyers cooperation as hereinafter
expressly provided) for causing the timely filing of all Tax Returns required
by law to be filed by the Companies with respect to periods ending on or prior
to the Closing Date, and for causing 



 

74  the timely payment of all Taxes due and payable under such Tax Returns, and
(B) Buyer shall be responsible for the timely filing of all Tax Returns
required by law to be filed by the Companies with respect to periods after
the Closing Date (including the Straddle Period Tax Returns), and for the
timely payment of all Taxes due and payable under such Tax Returns (except as
otherwise required under Section 11.4 (a) and (b)). All such Tax Returns
shall be true, correct and complete in all material respects and accurately
set forth all items to the extent required to be reflected or included in such
Tax Returns by applicable federal, state, local or foreign Tax Laws. Sellers
agree that they shall make (or have effective) a section 754 election (and any
similar election for state or local Tax purposes) with respect to any Company
treated as a partnership for Tax purposes.

(h) Buyer and Sellers agree that an amount equal to the Base Purchase Price
plus the LLC Estimated Adjusted Working Capital plus the aggregate amount of
any liabilities of the LLCs not assumed by Sellers plus the LLC Post-Closing
Adjustment (together, the " _Aggregate LLC Interest Purchase Price_ ") shall
be allocated among the LLC Interests as agreed to by Buyer and Sellers in
accordance with applicable Law prior to Closing taking into consideration the
fair market value of the LLC Interests and applicable Tax Law (the " _LLC
Allocation_ "). Buyer and Sellers agree that (i) they shall file all Tax
Returns and forms consistent with such LLC Allocation, (ii) in the event that
the IRS or any other Taxing Authority disputes the LLC Allocation, Sellers or
Buyer, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the other party of the nature
of such dispute, and shall cooperate in good faith in order to preserve the
effectiveness of the LLC Allocation, and (iii) for all Tax purposes, Buyer and
Sellers shall report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a
manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the LLC Allocation.
The LLC Allocation of the Aggregate LLC Purchase Price to each particular LLC
shall be allocated as agreed to by the Parties among the assets of such LLC in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code (it being understood and agreed that
the Parties shall base such allocation on the relative fair market values of
the assets as they may reasonably determine) and shall be set forth by in a
written notice signed by each Party within one hundred eighty (180) days
after the Closing. The Buyer and Sellers shall prepare and file their
respective federal, state and local income Tax returns, together with a copy
of Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, on a basis consistent with
the foregoing allocations, and shall not take any tax reporting position
inconsistent therewith.

(i) Buyer, A.T. Massey Sub, Buyers Sub 1 and the CRC Shareholders agree that
an amount equal to the First Merger Consideration plus the First Merger
Estimated Adjusted Working Capital plus the First Merger Post-Closing
Adjustment shall be allocated pro-rata among CRC Shareholders in respect of
their relative holdings of CRC Shares immediately prior to the First Merger
Effective Date (the " _CRC Equity Allocation_ "). Buyer, Buyers Sub 2 and the
PRRC Shareholders agree that an amount equal to the Second Merger
Consideration shall be allocated pro-rata among PRRC Shareholders in respect
of their relative holdings of PRRC Shares immediately prior to the Second
Merger Effective Date (the " _PRRC Equity Allocation_ " and, collectively
with the CRC Equity Allocation, the " _Equity Allocations_ "). Buyer and
Sellers agree that (i) they shall file all Tax Returns and forms consistent
with such Equity Allocations, (ii) in the event that the IRS or any other
Taxing Authority disputes any of the Equity Allocations, Sellers or Buyer, as
the case may be, shall promptly notify the other party of the 



 

75  nature of such dispute, and shall cooperate in good faith in order to
preserve the effectiveness of such Equity Allocation, and (iii) for all Tax
purposes, Buyer, A.T. Massey Sub, Buyers Sub 1, Buyers Sub 2, the CRC
Shareholders and the PRRC Shareholders shall report the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the terms of this
Agreement and the Equity Allocations.

(j) As of the Closing, all Tax sharing, Tax allocation or similar agreements
between any of the Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the Companies), on
the one hand, and any of the Companies, on the other hand, shall be terminated
and, after the Closing, none of the Companies shall have further rights or
obligations under any such agreements.

(k) After the Closing, Buyer and Sellers shall make available to the other, as
reasonably requested, and to any Taxing Authority, all information, records
or documents relating to the liability for Taxes or potential liability of the
Companies for Taxes for all periods prior to or including the Closing Date and
will preserve such information, records or documents until ninety (90) days
after the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations or extensions
thereof and thereafter shall notify the other party prior to the destruction
of such records. In addition, after the Closing, Buyer shall make available
to Sellers for the purpose of preparing all Income Tax Returns required to be
filed by the Companies with respect to periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date with respect to which the Company was a subchapter S corporation
or LLC taxed as a partnership or disregarded entity such staff members as may
be reasonably required by Sellers in order to prepare and complete such Tax
Returns. Buyer agrees that the staff members who have traditionally prepared
such returns for the Companies will prepare drafts of such Tax Returns and
submit them to Sellers for their review not less than 30 days prior to the
filing due date for such Tax Returns. Sellers will review such Tax Returns and
notify Buyer of any revisions, additions or changes to such Tax Returns not
less than 15 days prior to the filing due date for such Tax Returns, and Buyer
will cause the staff members to make Sellers revisions, additions or changes,
if any, and, if such Tax Returns are required to be signed and filed by
Sellers on behalf of the Companies, will provide completed Tax Returns ready
for signature and filing by Sellers not less than 5 days prior to the filing
due date for such Tax Returns, and Sellers will timely file such Tax Returns
on behalf of the Companies. If such Tax Returns are required to be signed and
filed by Buyer on behalf of the Companies, Buyer will timely sign and file
such Tax Returns on behalf of the Companies with Sellers revisions, additions
or changes, and will provide a copy of the signed Tax Returns to Sellers when
and as filed.

(l) After the Closing, except as expressly provided in Section 11.4(k), Buyer
shall not file any tax return, amendment or refund claim for any Tax accruing
or payable before Closing that would increase the Tax liability of Sellers
without the written consent of Sellers.

Section 11.5 _Indemnification by Buyer_ , A.T. Massey Sub, Buyers _Sub 1 and
Buyer s Sub 2_. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer, A.T. Massey Sub,
Buyers Sub 1 and Buyers Sub 2 shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and
their Affiliates and their respective Directors, managers, officers,
employees, shareholders, members and agents (" _Seller Indemnified Parties_
") against and in respect of all Losses sustained or incurred by any Seller
Indemnified Party, arising out of, in connection with or relating to (a) any
breaches of Buyer, A.T. Massey Subs, Buyers Sub 1s and Buyers Sub 2s
representations and warranties set forth 



 

76  in Sections 7.1(a) (Organization; Power), 7.1(b) (Authorization; Validity)
and the sixth and seventh sentences of 7.10 (Authorized Shares) or (b)
Buyers, A.T. Massey Subs, Buyers Sub 1s and Buyers Sub 2s covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement that by their terms contemplate

Buyers Sub 2 acknowledge and agree that in the event the Closing occurs (i)
absent actual fraud by Sellers or any of the former or current Directors and
officers of the Companies, its sole remedy against Sellers and any of the
former or current Directors and officers of the Companies for any matter
arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is set forth in
Sections 11.3 and 11.4 and (ii) except to the extent Buyer, A.T. Massey Sub,
Buyers Sub 1 or Buyers Sub 2 have asserted a claim for indemnification
under Section 11.3 or 11.4, Buyer, A.T. Massey Sub, Buyers Sub 1 and Buyers
Sub 2 shall have no remedy against any Seller or any of the former or current
Directors and officers of the Companies for any breach of a representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement, any certificate or other document
delivered pursuant hereto, or for any failure by a Seller or any of the former
or current Directors and officers of the Companies to perform or observe any
term, provision, covenant or agreement on their part to be performed or
observed after the Closing. Sellers, Buyer, A.T. Massey Sub, Buyers Sub 1 and
Buyers Sub 2 agree that the purpose of this Section 11.6 is to make it clear
that Sellers and the former or current Directors and officers of the Companies
are to have no liability whatsoever to Buyer, A.T. Massey Sub, Buyers Sub 1
and Buyers Sub 2 except as set forth in Sections 11.3 and 11.4, and
accordingly agree that this Section 11.6(a) is to be construed broadly. Buyer,
A.T. Massey Sub, Buyers Sub 1 and Buyers Sub 2 acknowledge that this Section
11.6(a) has been negotiated fully by Buyer, A.T. Massey Sub, Buyers Sub 1,
Buyers Sub 2 and Sellers and that Sellers would not have entered into this
Agreement but for the inclusion of this Section 11.6. Buyer may, at its own
cost and expense, seek to acquire insurance for some or all of
the representations and warranties made by Sellers in Article VI hereof and
Sellers agree to assist Buyer in connection therewith.

(b) Sellers acknowledge and agree that in the event the Closing occurs (i)
absent actual fraud by Buyer, its sole remedy against Buyer, A.T. Massey Sub,
Buyers Sub 1, Buyers Sub 2, the Companies or any other
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees or representatives of Buyer and
its Affiliates for any matter arising out of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, is set forth in Section 11.5 and (ii) except to the extent
Sellers have asserted a claim for indemnification under Section 11.5, Sellers
shall have no remedy against Buyer, A.T. Massey Sub, Buyers Sub 1, Buyers
Sub 2, the Companies or any other Affiliates, directors, officers, employees
or representatives of Buyer and its Affiliates or for any breach of a
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, any certificate or
other document delivered pursuant hereto, or for any failure by Buyer, A.T.
Massey Sub, Buyers Sub 1, Buyers Sub 2, the Companies or any other
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees or representatives of Buyer and its
Affiliates to perform or observe any term, provision, covenant or 



 

77  agreement on their part to be performed or observed after the Closing.
Sellers, Buyer, A.T. Massey Sub, Buyers Sub 1 and Buyers Sub 2 agree that
the purpose of this Section 11.6(b) is to make it clear that Buyer, A.T.
Massey Sub, Buyers Sub 1, Buyers Sub 2, the Companies or any other
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees or representatives of Buyer and its
Affiliates are to have no liability whatsoever to Sellers except as set forth
in Section 11.5, and accordingly agree that this Section 11.6(b) is to be
construed broadly. Sellers acknowledge that this Section 11.6(b) has been
negotiated fully by Buyer, A.T. Massey Sub, Buyers Sub 1, Buyers Sub 2 and
Sellers and that Buyer would not have entered into this Agreement but for the

seek to acquire insurance for some or all of the representations and
warranties made by Buyer in Article VII hereof and Buyer agrees to assist
Sellers in connection therewith.

Section 11.7 _No Consequential Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary elsewhere in this Agreement or provided for under any applicable Law,
no Party will be liable to any other Party, either in contract or in tort,
for any consequential, indirect, special, lost profits or punitive damages,
including loss of future revenue, income, or profits, or loss of business
reputation or opportunity of the other Party, relating to the breach or
alleged breach hereof or otherwise, whether or not the possibility of such

reasonably foreseen by such other Party.

ARTICLE XII

_Miscellaneous_

Section 12.1 _Amendment and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by Buyer and Sellers. No failure or delay
by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege.

Section 12.2 _Expenses_. Except as set forth in Schedule 12.2 or as otherwise
specifically provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by
the Party incurring such expenses.

Section 12.3 _Public Disclosure_. (a) Each of Sellers and Buyer hereby agrees
with the other Party or Parties that, except as may be required to comply with
the requirements of applicable Law (following consultation with the other
Parties if reasonably practicable), no press release or similar public
announcement or communication will be made or caused to be made concerning the
execution or performance of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements unless
specifically approved in advance by Buyer and Sellers Agent acting on behalf
of Sellers.

(b) Each Party shall maintain the confidentiality of the existence and terms
of this Agreement,  _provided_ , _that_ such Party may disclose this
Agreement and its terms to its Directors, officers, employees, consultants or
advisors of such Party who have a need to know such information.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, either Party may, and may permit,
disclosure of such confidential information (i) in response to any judicial or
administrative 



 

78  proceedings (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or
documents, subpoena, civil investigation demand or similar process); (ii) if
requested by a Governmental Entity; and (iii) to avoid violating the federal
securities laws; _provided_ , _that_ such disclosing Party will, to the extent
practicable, promptly notify the other Parties thereof and cooperate with the
non-disclosing Parties at such non-disclosing Parties reasonable request and
cost if the non-disclosing Parties should seek to obtain an order or agreement
pursuant to which confidential treatment will be accorded to such information.
The Parties, without prejudice to any rights to judicial relief they may
otherwise have, shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including an
injunction, in the event of a threatened or actual breach of this Section
12.3(b) and no Party shall resist such application for relief on the basis
that the other Party has an adequate remedy at law.

Section 12.4 _Assignment_. No Party, in any way, may assign or transfer any
of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other Parties. No Party may, in any way, delegate any

Sub 1 and Buyers Sub 2 may assign this Agreement (or any of their rights
hereunder) to any of their Affiliates without the prior written consent of
Sellers _; provided_ , _however_ , that any such assignee shall become
a party to this Agreement by executing a counterpart hereof and no such
assignment shall relieve Buyer, A.T. Massey Sub, Buyers Sub 1 and Buyers Sub
2 of any of their obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of Sellers, _provided, further_ , that Buyer, A.T. Massey Sub,
Buyers Sub 1 and Buyers Sub 2 shall not assign this Agreement (or any of its
rights hereunder) if the effect of such assignment would be to cause either
the First Merger or the Second Merger not to qualify as a reorganization
under Section 368 of the Code.

Section 12.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including all Annexes,
Schedules and Exhibits hereto), the Ancillary Agreements and the
Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire agreement among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters. The only
conditions precedent to this Agreements effectiveness are those expressly
stated in it.

Section 12.6 _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Any obligation of any Party to any
other Party under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, which
obligation is performed, satisfied or fulfilled by an Affiliate of such Party,
shall be deemed to have been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such Party.

Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Other than with respect to
Section 11.6, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to

Agreement. The Parties reserve the right and power to modify or terminate this
Agreement without the consent of any other person who is not a party to this
Agreement. 

Section 12.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original by the Parties executing such counterpart, but all of which shall be
considered one and the same instrument.

of contents contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and

81 Section 12.13 _Scheduled Exceptions and Documents_.

(a) When a Schedule is referenced in a provision of this Agreement as setting
forth information (including exceptions or exclusions) relevant to a
representation, warranty, definition or statement made in such provision, the
information (including exceptions or exclusions) set forth in such Schedule
are exceptions and exclusions to such representation, warranty, definition
or statement and such other representations, warranties, definitions and
statements that it would be reasonably apparent to a reader, based on the
statement or description included in a Schedule, that the information
(including exceptions or exclusions) in such Schedule is relevant to such
other representation, warranty, definition or statement.

(b) Certain of the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement
contemplated that there will be attached schedules setting forth information
that might be "material" or have a "Material Adverse Effect" or might not be
in the "Ordinary Course of Business." The Sellers may, at their option,
include in such schedules items or information that are not material or are
not likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or are in the Ordinary Course of
Business in order to avoid any misunderstanding, and any such inclusion shall
not be deemed to be an acknowledgement or representation that such items are
material or would have a Material Adverse Effect, to establish any standard of
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or Ordinary Course of Business, or to
define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement.

Section 12.14 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof
unless such invalidity or unenforceability, after taking into account the
mitigation contemplated by the next sentence, deprives a Party of a material
benefit contemplated by this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or
unenforceable: (a) subject to, in the case of the Restrictive Covenants, the
provisions of Section 8.4(d), a suitable and equitable provision shall be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, as far as may be valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable
provision; and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such
invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability
affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application
thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

Section 12.15 _Representative_. (a) Each of Sellers irrevocably appoints
Sellers Agent, Richard B. Gilliam, as its agent and attorney-in-fact, to
take any action required or permitted to be taken by Sellers under the terms
of this Agreement, including, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the giving and receipt of any notices to be delivered or received
by or on behalf of Sellers and the right to waive any of the terms of this
Agreement, and agree to be bound by any and all actions taken by Sellers
Agent on behalf of Sellers.

(b) Buyer shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon any communications or
writings given or executed by Sellers Agent and shall not be liable in any
manner whatsoever for any action taken or not taken in reliance upon the
actions taken or not taken or communications or writings given or executed by
Sellers Agent when acting on behalf of Sellers. In the event of
a replacement of a Sellers Agent, the Sellers Agent that is being replaced
shall promptly notify Buyer of such change, and until such notification, the
Sellers Agent that is being replaced shall be deemed to be Sellers Agent
in any dealings with Buyer under this Agreement.



 

82 (c) When in this Agreement it is stated that certain actions will be taken or
omitted to be taken or certain notices received by Sellers Agent acting on
behalf of Sellers, then Sellers shall take or omit to take such action or
receive such notice solely through or by Sellers Agent.
