2.1 The Merger. Upon and subject to the terms set forth in this Agreement and
in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall thereupon cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Company after the
Merger is sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation." 2.2
Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at 9:00
a.m. (Pacific time) on the second Business Day following the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time) at the offices of
Parent, unless another time, date or place is agreed to by the Parties (the
date on which the Closing occurs, the "Closing Date"). 2.3 Effective Time.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing
Date, the Parties shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware a certificate of merger in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Parent and the Company, executed in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the DGCL (the "Certificate of Merger"). The Merger shall become effective
upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such later time as is
agreed to by the Parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time
at which the Merger becomes effective, the "Effective Time"). 2.4 Effects of
the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and
the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject
thereto, from and after the Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges,
immunities, powers, franchises, licenses, and authority of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions, and duties of each of the Company and
Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, and
duties of the Surviving Corporation. 2  

  

 ![](exhibit21004.jpg) 

2.5 Charter Documents of Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time: (a) the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and
restated so as to be identical to the certificate of incorporation of Merger
Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name
of the Surviving Corporation shall be the name of the Company as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and, as so amended and restated,
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with the terms thereof or as provided by
applicable Law; and (b) the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation,
except that references to Merger Sub\'s name shall be replaced with references
to the Surviving Corporation\'s name, until thereafter amended in accordance
with the terms thereof, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, or as provided by applicable Law. 2.6 Directors and Officers.
Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the Parties
(other than the Stockholders' Representative) shall take all requisite action
so that the directors and officers of Merger Sub, in each case, immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the
directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until their
successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation, or removal in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 2.7 Effect of the
Merger on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action to be taken on the part of the holder of any shares of the
Company Capital Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub, or on the
part of the Parties or any other Person, the following shall occur: 2.7.1
Merger Sub Stock. Each share of Merger Sub capital stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers, and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and
after the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger Sub
capital stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence 2.7.2
Cancellation of Certain Company Capital Stock. Each share of Company Capital
Stock owned by the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) or any of its
wholly owned Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"Cancelled Shares") will automatically be canceled and retired and will cease
to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor. 2.7.3
Conversion of Company Capital Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each share of Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares or
Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to receive: (i) the Per
Share Closing Consideration as set forth in Consideration Payment Schedule;
and (ii) the nontransferable contingent right to receive such share's
applicable portion of the Contingent Consideration, if any, in accordance with
Section 2.12.6(a) and as set forth in the Consideration Payment Schedule. This
Section 2.7.3 assumes that, prior to the Effective Time as required by Section
6.1.4, (i) all shares of Company Preferred Stock have been converted to
Company Common Stock, and (ii) all Company Derivative Securities have been
exercised or cancelled. In the event that any of such closing conditions have
not been satisfied prior to the Effective Time, but Parent elects to waive
such condition, Parent shall propose an amendment to this Section 2.7.3 and
Section 2.12 (as well as other Sections of, and Annexes, Schedules and
Exhibits to, this Agreement as necessary or appropriate) for approval by the
Company (such approval to not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) that accounts for the existence of such Company Preferred Stock
and/or Company Derivative Securities in a manner consistent with the Company
Charter and the terms of any such Company Derivative Security, and upon such
approval by the Company, all Parties agree to be bound by such amendment.
2.7.4 Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company
Capital Stock pursuant to this Section 2.7 and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a holder
of shares of Parent Common Stock, and instead the total number of shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued to the holder of such Company Capital Stock
will instead be rounded down to the nearest whole number. 3  

  

 ![](exhibit21005.jpg) 

2.7.5 Rights Cease to Exist. As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company
Capital Stock shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled
and shall cease to exist and each holder thereof shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in this Section 2.7
and, to the extent such shares are Dissenting Shares, the rights granted by
Section 262 of the DGCL. 2.8 Consideration Calculation. Not less than two
calendar days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver a schedule
(the "Consideration Payment Schedule") to Parent setting forth the following
information, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and
accompanied by documentation reasonably satisfactory to Parent in support of
the information set forth therein, and that is certified by the chief
executive officer of the Company: 2.8.1 the Company's calculation of: (a) the
Net Cash Amount; (b) the Per Share Closing Consideration; and (c) the Fully
Diluted Shares of Company Capital Stock, in each case, as of the Closing Date;
and 2.8.2 with respect to each Stockholder: (a) the name, address, telephone
number and email address of such Stockholder; (b) whether such Stockholder is
a current or former Employee of the Company; (c) the number of shares Company
Capital Stock held by such Stockholder (both by class or series and on an as
converted to Company Common Stock basis) and the respective certificate
numbers of all certificates evidencing all such shares; (d) the number of any
such shares that are Dissenting Shares; (e) with respect to any shares of
Company Capital Stock issued to such Stockholder on or after January 1, 2011
and any other securities that, in each case, are "covered securities" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulations Â§1.6045-1(a)(15), the acquisition date and
adjusted tax bases of such shares; (f) the number of the Closing Shares
issuable to such Stockholder; (g) the identification of any shares of Company
Capital Stock held by such Stockholder that were eligible for an election
under Section 83(b) of the Code, including the date of issuance of such
shares, and whether such election under 83(b) of the Code was timely made; (h)
the identification of any shares of Company Capital Stock that were acquired
by such Stockholder through the exercise of a Company Option, whether such
option was a nonstatutory option or intended to qualify as an incentive stock
option as defined in Section 422 of the Code, the date of grant of such
option, and the date of exercise of such option; and (i) such Stockholder's
Pro Rata Share. If any item required to be set forth in the Consideration
Payment Schedule pursuant to Section 2.8.2 is not applicable to a particular
Stockholder, the Consideration Payment Schedule shall state the same. Parent
shall be entitled to rely on the Consideration Payment Schedule in making
payments to Effective Time Holders pursuant to this Agreement; provided,
however, that such reliance shall not in any manner limit Parent's right to be
indemnified under ARTICLE VIII for any Losses arising out of or related to any
errors or omissions in the Consideration Payment Schedule. 2.9 Payments at
Closing. At the Closing, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the payees
thereof, the Company Transaction Expenses that are unpaid as of the Closing,
in each case as directed in a certificate duly executed by the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company and delivered to Parent prior to the Closing (the
"Company Transaction Expenses Certificate"). The Company Transaction Expenses
Certificate shall also certify that the amounts of the Company Transaction
Expenses set forth therein are the only outstanding and unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses that are unpaid as of the Closing and shall otherwise be
in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent. 2.10 Dissenting
Shares. 2.10.1 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, shares of Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and held
by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or
consented thereto in writing and who is entitled to demand and has properly
exercised appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL (such shares of Company Capital Stock being referred to collectively
as the "Dissenting Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise waives, withdraws, or loses such holder\'s appraisal rights under
the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to
receive the consideration for Company Capital Stock set forth in Section 2.7,
but instead shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section
262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if, after the Effective Time, such
holder fails to perfect, waives, withdraws, or loses such holder\'s right to
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the 4  

  

 ![](exhibit21006.jpg) 

DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder
is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares
of Company Capital Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of
the Effective Time into the right to receive the consideration for Company
Capital Stock set forth in Section 2.7, without interest thereon, upon
surrender of certificate formerly representing such share or the cancellation
of such shares registered in electronic form, as the case may be. 2.10.2
Demands for Appraisal. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any
demand for appraisal received by the Company pursuant to the applicable
provisions of the DGCL, and (b) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to any such demands or offer to settle or settle any such demands. Any
communication to be made by the Company with respect to such demands must be
submitted and approved in writing by Parent prior to such communication being
made. 2.11 Exchange of Certificates. 2.11.1 Payment Procedures. Following the
Effective Time, Parent shall send to each Effective Time Holder: (i) a letter
of transmittal in customary form (each, a "Letter of Transmittal") (which
shall contain a release of claims substantially in the form of Section 5.15,
an agreement to the appointment of Stockholders' Representative as provided
for in Section 8.4, an agreement to indemnify Parent Indemnified Persons for
Losses as provided in ARTICLE VIII, and representations regarding such
Effective Time Holder's accredited investor status), and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of
the applicable portion of the Total Merger Consideration, if any. Upon receipt
by Parent of written documentation evidencing the cancellation (a "Carta
Cancellation") of the electronic stock certificates representing the shares of
Company Capital Stock (the "Certificates") from the Company\'s transfer agent,
Carta, Inc., together with the Letter of Transmittal duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, a duly executed
accredited investor questionnaire in form and substance mutually agreeable to
Parent and the Company (the "AI Questionnaire"), a Joinder, and such other
customary documents as may reasonably be required by Parent, the applicable
Effective Time Holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, such
amount of the Closing Consideration and Contingent Consideration, if any, to
which the applicable Effective Time Holder is entitled to under the terms of
this Agreement, without interest, in accordance with, and subject to, the
terms of this Agreement. If payment of any portion of the Total Merger
Consideration is to be made to any Person other than the Person in whose name
the shares of Company Capital Stock is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that (a) the Certificates representing such Shares be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer in accordance with
Section 2.11.2 and (b) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the applicable
portion of the Total Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of such shares or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable. After the Effective Time, each Certificate shall represent only
the right to receive the applicable portion of the Total Merger Consideration,
as contemplated by this ARTICLE II. 2.11.2 Transfer Books; No Further
Ownership Rights in Company Stock. The Closing Shares issued in respect of
shares of Company Capital Stock (together with the contingent right to
receive, if, when and to the extent payable, the Contingent Consideration)
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms
of this ARTICLE II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Capital Stock previously
represented by such Certificates and at the close of business on the day on
which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of
Company Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE II. 2.12 Contingent Consideration. In
addition to the Closing Shares, Parent shall pay to the Effective Time Holders
the Contingent Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.12 and subject
to the other terms of this Agreement. 2.12.1 Intentionally Omitted. 5  

  

 ![](exhibit21007.jpg) 

2.12.2 Future Investment. If, on or before January 31, 2023, Parent receives
not less than $[***] in gross proceeds from an equity investment by [***] in a
single capital raising transaction (provided, however, that the definitive
agreement for such single capital raising transaction may provide for one or
more closings, tranches, or similar, related events so long as not less than
$[***] in gross proceeds is received by Parent no later than [***] months
following the date the parties enter into such definitive agreement) (the
"Investment"), the Effective Time Holders shall be entitled to receive an
aggregate of $[***] (the "Investment Consideration"), which will be payable,
in the sole discretion of Parent, in cash or shares of Parent Common Stock. If
the Investment Consideration is paid in shares of Parent Common Stock, the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will be issued will be
such number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (a) $[***] divided by
(b) the greater of (1) $1.15 or (2) the 5-Day Average over the five
consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the
date on which Parent enters into the definitive agreement with respect to the
Investment. 2.12.3 Development and Commercial Milestones. Parent shall pay
each Milestone Payment to the Effective Time Holders if the corresponding
Milestone Event is achieved. For the avoidance of doubt, if a Milestone Event
is not achieved, Parent shall have no obligation whatsoever to pay the
corresponding Milestone Payment. If for any reason a Clinical Development
Milestone does not occur prior to the occurrence of the subsequent Clinical
Milestone set forth in Annex 2.12.3, then the skipped Clinical Development
Milestone shall be deemed to occur upon the occurrence of the subsequent
Development Milestone. 2.12.4 Royalty and Licensee Revenue Payments. (a)
General. Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, Parent shall pay to the
Effective Time Holders royalties during the Royalty Term calculated as a
percentage of Annual Net Sales in accordance with the table set forth on Annex
2.12.4. (b) Royalty Stacking. If Parent or its Affiliate is a party to a
royalty-bearing license agreement with any Third Party, which license is
employed in the manufacture, use and/or sale of an Acquired Product, then
Parent may reduce the royalty rate applicable to such Acquired Product by
[***]% for each [***]% of royalty rate payable to such Third Party, provided,
however, that in no event will the royalty rate otherwise due to the Effective
Time Holders be reduced to less than the greater of (i) [***] percent ([***]%)
or (ii) [***]% of the applicable royalty rate in Annex 2.12.4. (c)
Intentionally Omitted. (d) One Royalty. For clarity, only one royalty shall be
due to the Effective Time Holders with respect to the same unit of an Acquired
Product. (e) Reports and Payment. Royalty and Licensee Revenue Share payments
shall be made by Parent to Effective Time Holders within sixty (60) days after
the end of each calendar quarter in which the Net Sales or Licensee Revenue is
received, commencing with the calendar quarter following the First Commercial
Sale. Parent shall also provide, at the same time each such payment is made, a
report showing, in respect of the activities of such calendar quarter: (a) the
gross sales of each Acquired Product by type and country; (b) deductions from
gross sales to determine Net Sales; (c) the applicable royalty rate(s) for
such Net Sales; (d) a calculation of the total royalties for such Net Sales;
(e) Licensee Revenue; (f) Licensee Revenue Share; and (g) the total amount
payable by Parent under Sections 2.12.4 and 2.12.5. (f) Currency Conversion.
In the case of Net Sales and Licensee Revenue outside the United States, for
purposes of paying the royalties and Licensee Revenue Share hereunder,
payments received by Parent and its Affiliates will be expressed in the U.S.
Dollar equivalent calculated on a quarterly basis in the currency of the
country of sale and converted to their U.S. Dollar equivalent using the
average rate of exchange over the applicable calendar quarter to which the
sales relate, in accordance with the rate of exchange for such currency
reported in The Wall Street Journal, Internet U.S. Edition at www.wsj.com, as
of the last day of the applicable reporting period (or, if unavailable on such
date, the first date thereafter on which such rate is available). (g) Records
and Audits. Parent will keep complete and accurate records of the underlying
revenue data relating to the calculations of Net Sales and Licensee Revenue
received in any given calendar 6  

  

 ![](exhibit21008.jpg) 

year during the Royalty Term and for three (3) years thereafter. The
Stockholders' Representative may, once annually at the Effective Time Holders'
expense, have a nationally recognized, independent, certified public
accounting firm, selected by it and subject to Parent's prior written consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld), review any such records of Parent
and its Affiliates (the "Audited Party") in the location(s) where such records
are maintained by the Audited Party upon reasonable written notice (which
shall be no less than 30 days' prior written notice) and during regular
business hours and under obligations of strict confidence, for the sole
purpose of verifying the basis and accuracy of the payments payable under
Section 2.12.4. No period of time will be subject to audit under this Section
2.12.4(g) more than once. The Audited Party will receive a copy of each such
report concurrently with receipt by the Stockholders' Representative. Should
such audit certify a discrepancy to the Effective Time Holders' detriment, the
Audited Party will, within 45 days after receipt of such report from the
accounting firm, pay any undisputed amount of the discrepancy. The Effective
Time Holders will pay the full cost of the review unless the underpayment of
amounts due to the Effective Time Holders is certified to be greater than
[***] percent ([***]%) of the amount due for the entire period being examined,
in which case the Audited Party will pay the cost charged by such accounting
firm for such review. Should the audit lead to the discovery of a discrepancy
to the Audited Party's detriment, the Audited Party may credit the amount of
the discrepancy, without interest, against future payments payable under this
Agreement, and if there are no such payments payable, then the Effective Time
Holders shall pay to the Audited Party the amount of the discrepancy, without
interest, within 45 days of the Stockholders' Representative receipt of the
report. In addition to and not in limitation of the foregoing, the
Stockholders' Representative (or its delegate), at the Effective Time Holders'
expense and upon reasonable notice to Parent (but not more than once
annually), shall have access to the same records of Parent and its Affiliates
set forth above and subject to the same terms set forth above regarding
regular business hours and obligations of confidentiality. 2.12.5 License
Revenue Share. Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, Parent shall pay
the Effective Time Holders [***]% of Licensee Revenue. In no event will any
license to a Licensee relieve Parent of its obligations to pay applicable
Milestone Payments. If a Licensee achieves a Milestone Event, then Parent
shall pay the Effective Time Holders the greater of (a) the corresponding
Milestone Payment hereunder (in which case, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent
shall not also pay a Licensee Revenue Share on amounts received from the
Licensee for its achievement of such Milestone Event) or (b) [***]% of the
milestone payment that Parent receives from such Licensee for achievement of
such Milestone Event. 2.12.6 Payment of Contingent Consideration. (a)
Allocation of Payments. Any and all Contingent Consideration Payments to be
made under this Agreement will be allocated among the Effective Time Holders
according to their Pro Rata Share. (b) Notification and Payment of Contingent
Consideration. Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholders' Representative
after a Contingent Consideration Payment becomes due and payable, and within
30 Business Days of so notifying the Stockholders' Representative, Parent
shall provide to the Stockholders' Representative a statement setting forth
the amount and calculation of the Contingent Consideration Payments (the
"Contingent Payment Statement"). Within 20 Business Days of the receipt of
such Contingent Payment Statement, the Stockholders' Representative shall
provide a written response to Parent stating whether the Stockholders'
Representative agrees with or objects to the amount or calculation of the
Contingent Consideration Payment set forth on the Contingent Payment
Statement. If the Stockholders' Representative agrees with such Contingent
Payment Statement or if the Stockholders' Representative fails to provide a
written response to Parent within such 20 Business Day period, then, subject
to Sections 2.12.6(d), 2.12.7 and 2.15 and any other term of this Agreement,
Parent shall promptly pay or cause to be paid the applicable Contingent
Consideration Payment to the Effective Time Holders according to their Pro
Rata Share. If the Stockholders' Representative timely objects to the
Contingent Payment Statement, then Parent and the Stockholders' Representative
shall attempt in good faith for 10 Business Days to resolve such dispute. If
Parent and the Stockholders' Representative reach an agreement with respect to
the Contingent Payment Statement within such 10 Business Day period, then
within five Business Days of such agreement, subject to Sections 2.12.6(d),
2.12.7 and 2.15 and any other term of this Agreement, Parent shall pay or
cause to be paid the applicable Contingent Consideration Payment in accordance
with their agreement. If Parent and the Stockholders' Representative are
unable reach an 7  

  

 ![](exhibit21009.jpg) 

agreement within such 10 Business Day period, the disputed items shall be
resolved by an independent nationally recognized accounting firm selected by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Stockholders' Representatives (the
"Accounting Firm"), and any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be
final. The Accounting Firm shall resolve any disputed items with respect to
the Contingent Payment Statement within 30 days of having the item referred to
it pursuant to such procedures as it may require. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be deducted and paid from the applicable Contingent
Consideration Payment unless the underpayment of amounts due to the Effective
Time Holders is certified to be greater than [***] percent ([***]%) of the
amount due for the entire period being examined, in which case Parent will pay
the cost charged by such accounting firm for such review. Subject to Sections
2.12.6(d), 2.12.7 and 2.15 and any other term of this Agreement, Parent shall
pay or cause to be paid the applicable Contingent Consideration Payment (after
deducting the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm) within five Business
Days of receipt of the determination by the Accounting Firm. To the extent any
Contingent Consideration Payment is paid in cash, the amount thereof shall be
paid in U.S. Dollars by wire transfer or electronic funds transfer of
immediately available funds by Parent to the Effective Time Holders in
accordance with their Pro Rata Share, and if paid in shares of Parent Common
Stock, the applicable shares will be issued directly to the Effective Time
Holders in accordance with their Pro Rata Share. (c) Fractional Shares. To the
extent any Contingent Consideration Payment is paid in shares of Parent Common
Stock, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a holder of shares
of Parent Common Stock, and instead the total number of shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued to the holder of such Company Capital Stock will
instead be rounded down to the nearest whole number. (d) 20% Limitation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if any Contingent
Consideration Payment becomes payable to the Effective Time Holders that, if
paid in shares of Parent Common Stock, would result in an issuance of Parent
Common Stock in excess of the Share Cap when combined with the total number of
shares of Parent Common Stock issued under this Agreement prior to such
issuance, at Parent's sole discretion, Parent shall either (i) seek Parent
Stockholder Approval at a meeting of Parent's stockholders (whether an annual
meeting or a special meeting) to be held no later than nine months from the
date that such Contingent Consideration Payment becomes payable, and issue
such shares to the Effective Time Holders promptly upon receipt of the Parent
Stockholder Approval following such meeting, or (ii)(x) promptly issue to the
Effective Time Holders no more than the maximum number of shares of Parent
Common Stock that, when combined with the total number of shares of Parent
Common Stock issued under this Agreement prior to such issuance, would not
exceed the Share Cap, and (y) to the extent any amount of a Contingent
Consideration Payment is not paid in shares of Parent Common Stock due to the
operation of clause (ii)(x), promptly pay an amount in cash to the Effective
Time Holders equal to such Contingent Consideration Payment less the aggregate
fair market value of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in accordance
with clause (ii)(x); provided that where Parent does not receive Parent
Stockholder Approval pursuant to clause (i), then Parent shall promptly issue
the shares of Parent Common Stock and pay such amount in cash to the Effective
Time Holders pursuant to clause (ii). For purposes of clause (ii)(y), the fair
market value of a share of Parent Common Stock shall equal (A) if the Parent
Common Stock is listed on Nasdaq, another national securities exchange, the
over-the-counter market or any other nationally recognized trading system on
the date on which such Contingent Consideration becomes payable, the 5-Day
Average over the five consecutive trading days ending on the trading day
immediately prior to the date on which such Contingent Consideration Payment
becomes payable, or (B) if the Parent Common Stock is not traded on Nasdaq,
another national securities exchange, the over-the-counter market or any other
nationally recognized trading system on the date on which such Contingent
Consideration becomes payable, such price as a valuation firm selected by the
Parent board of directors and acceptable to the Stockholders' Representative
determines is the fair market value of the Parent Common Stock as of such date
2.12.7 Right to Set-off. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Parent shall have the right to withhold and set off against any amount
otherwise due in respect of any Contingent Consideration the amount of any
Losses to which any Parent Indemnified Persons may be entitled under ARTICLE
VIII or any amount required to be paid or reimbursed by the Effective Time
Holders under Section 5.8. 8  

  

 ![](exhibit21010.jpg) 

2.13 No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
none of the Parties shall be liable to any Person for any portion of the Total
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 2.14 Withholding Taxes.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation shall deduct and withhold from any
payment payable to an Effective Time Holder under this Agreement and shall pay
to the appropriate Taxing Authority such amounts that are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under any Tax
Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid to a Taxing Authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Effective Time Holder in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made. 2.15 Holdback. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, all of the Closing Shares and any and all other shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable or issued under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement to the Effective Time Holders (collectively, the
"Holdback Shares") and any cash payable or paid by Parent under this Agreement
or any other Transaction Agreement to the Effective Time Holders will be held
by Parent in escrow to satisfy the Effective Time Holders' indemnification
obligations under, and in accordance with, ARTICLE VIII or any amount required
to be paid or reimbursed by the Effective Time Holders under Section 5.8. 2.16
Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this ARTICLE II (and
without in any way limiting the covenants in Section 5.1), if between the
Agreement Date and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of any class or
series of Company Capital Stock are changed into a different number of shares
or a different class or series by reason of the occurrence or record date of
any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the per share Total
Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction. 2.17 Aggregate Consideration.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall
the aggregate amounts to be paid to the Stockholders pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to shares of Company Capital Stock exceed (a) in
respect of the amounts payable at the Closing, the Closing Shares and (b) in
respect of the amounts payable thereafter, the portion of the Contingent
Consideration, if any, payable to the Effective Time Holders. Parent and the
Company agree and acknowledge that Parent is: (i) issuing the Closing Shares
solely in exchange for the cash and cash equivalents of the Company less any
liabilities of the Company, in each case, as of the Closing; and (ii) agreeing
to pay the Contingent Consideration for all of the other assets of the
Company, including its Intellectual Property Rights and technology. ARTICLE

forth a true and complete list of all Company Plans together with a brief
description of the type of plan and benefit provided thereunder. The Company
has provided or made available to Parent a current, accurate and complete copy
(including amendments) of each Company Plan, or a copy of the representative
form agreement thereof, and written descriptions of all non-written Company
Plans. None of the Company Plans provides for post- employment life or health
coverage for any participant or any beneficiary of a participant, except as
may be required under Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, Section 4980B
of the Code or any similar state law and at the expense of the participant or
the participant's beneficiary. All contributions required to have been made
under any of the Company Plans or by Law (without regard to any waivers
granted under Section 412 of the Code), have been timely made. There are no
unfunded liabilities or benefits under any Company Plans that are not
reflected in the Financial Statements. 3.10.2 ERISA. No Company Plan is
subject to Title IV of ERISA or is otherwise a Defined Benefit Plan as defined
in Section 3(35) of ERISA (a "Title IV Plan") and neither the Company nor any
other entity (whether or not incorporated) that, together with the Company,
would be treated as a single employer under Section 414 of the Code or Section
4001 of ERISA (each an "ERISA Affiliate") has incurred any liability pursuant
to Title IV of ERISA that remains unsatisfied. Neither the Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate has sponsored, contributed or had an obligation to contribute,
to any Title IV Plan, or any money purchase pension plan subject to Section
412 of the Code, within the past six years. No Company Plan is or has been a
multiemployer plan within the meaning 15  

  

 ![](exhibit21017.jpg) 

of Section 3(37) of ERISA or a multiple employer welfare arrangement within
the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA. 3.10.3 Conformity with Laws. All
Company Plans have been established, operated and maintained in accordance
with their terms and with all applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and
other Laws. All amendments and actions required to bring the Company Plans
into conformity in all material respects with all of the applicable provisions
of the Code, ERISA and other applicable Laws have been made or taken, except
to the extent that such amendments or actions are not required by Law to be
made or taken until a date after the Effective Time. Each Company Plan that is
intended to be qualified under Code Section 401(a) and the trust (if any)
forming a part thereof has received a favorable determination letter from the
IRS or, with respect to a master or prototype plan, can rely on an opinion
letter from the IRS to the master or prototype plan sponsor. To the Company's
Knowledge, nothing has occurred that would reasonably be expected to cause the
loss of such qualification. There are no pending Actions arising from or
relating to the Company Plans (other than routine benefit claims), nor does
the Company have any Knowledge of facts that could form or could reasonably be
expected to form the basis for any such Action. 3.10.4 Compliance with Section
409A of the Code. To the extent that any Company Plan is a "Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Plan," as such term is defined in Section 409A of the
Code, such Company Plan is in documentary and operational compliance with
Section 409A of the Code and all applicable guidance issued by the IRS
thereunder. 3.11 Employment Matters. 3.11.1 Section 3.11.1 of the Disclosure
Schedules sets forth a complete and accurate list containing the name of each
current Employee and each Consultant that provided services to the Company or
during the 12 months prior to the Agreement Date, and each such person's
position, starting employment date, title, annual salary or hourly wage rate,
as applicable, employee's designation as either exempt or non-exempt from the
overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act and applicable state and
local wage laws, commissions, bonus (target, maximum and any amounts paid for
the current year), leave status (including type of leave, expected return date
for non-disability related leaves and expiration dates for disability leaves),
visa status and accrued but unpaid vacation balances, and, with respect to
Consultants, the nature of the services provided and aggregate compensation
paid in the prior 12 months. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the
Employees or Consultants listed in Section 3.11.1 of the Disclosure Schedule
intends to terminate his or her employment or contracting relationship with
the Company after the Closing. 3.11.2 Other than as fully reflected or
specifically reserved against in accordance with GAAP in the Financial
Statements (or as otherwise expressly permitted or required pursuant to this
Agreement), neither the Company nor any Stockholder has paid or promised to
pay any bonuses, commissions or incentives to any Employee or Consultant. The
Company has paid to each current and former Employee the entire amount of the
bonus, if any, earned by such Employee for any period ended before the
Agreement Date and no bonus amounts, payable to any current or former
Employee, is unpaid as of the Agreement Date. 3.11.3 Since the Company's
inception, (a) the Company has paid or made provision for payment of all
salaries and wages, which are payable by the Company to any Employees, accrued
through the Closing Date, and has been and is in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable Laws pertaining to employment and employment
practices, including wages and hours, benefits, collective bargaining, equal
employment opportunity, workplace safety, affirmative action, immigration,
employment discrimination, disability rights or benefits, workers'
compensation, labor relations, employee leave issues, worker classification,
unemployment insurance and layoffs, terms and conditions of employment, the
collection and payment of withholding and/or payroll taxes and similar Taxes,
including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act of 1967, the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, ERISA,
the Equal Pay Act, the National Labor Relations Act, the Fair Labor Standards
Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Vietnam Era Veterans
Reemployment Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act and any and all similar
applicable state and local Laws; and (b) the Company has not been engaged in
any unfair employment practice. There are no Actions against the Company, or
to the Company's Knowledge, threatened to be brought or filed, by or with any
Governmental Authority or by any current or former Employee in connection with
the employment (or termination thereof) of any current or former Employees,
including any claim relating to unfair labor practices, employment 16  

  

 ![](exhibit21018.jpg) 

discrimination, harassment, retaliation, equal pay or any other employment
related matter arising under applicable Laws. 3.11.4 Neither the execution and
delivery of the Transaction Agreements by the Company nor the consummation of
the Transactions (including the Merger) by the Company, shall result in (a)
any payment becoming due to any Employee or Consultant, (b) the provision of
any benefits or other rights to any current or former Employee or Consultant,
(c) the increase, acceleration or provision of any payments, benefits or other
rights to any current or former Employee or Consultant, whether or not any
such payment, right or benefit would constitute a "parachute payment" within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, or (d) require any contributions or
payments to fund any obligations under any Company Plan. No amount so
disclosed is an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code. The services provided by Employees and Consultants are terminable
at the will of the Company and any such termination would result in no
liability to the Company (other than ordinary administration expenses). The
Company has no direct or indirect liability with respect to any
misclassification of (i) any person as an independent contractor rather than
as an employee, (ii) any employee leased from another employer or (iii) any
employee currently or formerly classified as exempt from overtime wages.
3.11.5 The Company is not a party to or bound by any collective bargaining
agreement or other Contract with any labor organization or other
representative of any of the Employees, and no collective bargaining agreement
is being negotiated by the Company. There is no labor strike, dispute,
slowdown, work stoppage or lockout that is pending, threatened against,
reasonably anticipated or otherwise affecting the Company. The Company has not
closed any plant or facility, effectuated any layoffs of employees, incurred
any liability under the Worker Administration and Retraining Notification Act
or similar state or local law that remains unsatisfied, or implemented any
early retirement or separation program at any time from or after its
inception, nor has the Company planned or announced any such action or program
for the future with respect to which the Company would have any liability.
Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is party to a conciliation
agreement, consent decree or other agreement or order with any Governmental
Authority with respect to employment practices. 3.12 Environmental Matters.
The Company is and at all times has been, in compliance with all applicable
Environmental Laws. There is no Action relating to or arising under
Environmental Laws that is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against or affecting the Company. The Company has not received any
notice of, or entered into, or assumed by Contract or operation of Law, any
obligation, liability, order, settlement, judgment, injunction or decree
relating to or arising under Environmental Laws. To the Knowledge of the
Company, there are no facts, circumstances or conditions existing with respect
to the Company or any property or facility to or at which the Company
transported or arranged for the disposal or treatment of Hazardous Materials
that could reasonably be expected to result in the Company incurring any
Environmental Liability. 3.13 Contracts. 3.13.1 Material Contracts. Section

3.13.2 Documentation. The Company has previously made available to Parent (a)
true and complete copies of each written Material Contract and (b) a summary
of each oral Material Contract, together with any and all amendments,
supplements and "side letters" thereto. 3.13.3 Status of Material Contracts.
Each Material Contract is valid and binding on the Company, in full force and
effect, and is enforceable in accordance with its terms by the Company. The
Company is not in breach or default under any Material Contract, nor does any
condition exist that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
breach or default in any respect thereunder by the Company or that would
result in material liability to the Company. To the Knowledge of the Company,
(a) no other party to any Material Contract is in default thereunder and (b)
no condition exists that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute
a default in any material respect by any such other party thereunder. The
Company has not received notice of any termination or cancellation of any
Material Contract and to the Company's Knowledge, no other party to a Material
Contract has plans to terminate or cancel such Material Contract. The Company
has not and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no other party to any Material
Contract has repudiated any material provision of any Material Contract. The
Company is not disputing and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no other party
to such Material Contract is disputing, any material provision of any Material
Contract. None of the parties to any Material Contract is renegotiating any
material amounts paid or payable to or by the Company under such Material
Contract or any other material term or provision thereof. 3.14 Assets: Title,
Sufficiency, Condition. The Company has good, valid and marketable title to or
sole and exclusive leasehold interest in or adequate right to use all of its
assets whether real or personal, tangible or intangible, including those that
are used in the conduct of its business, located on its premises or reflected
in the Interim Balance Sheet as being owned by the Company or acquired after
the date thereof (the "Assets"), free and clear of all Liens except Permitted
Liens. The Assets constitute all of the assets, properties and rights of every
type and description that are used in and necessary for the conduct of the
Company's business. 3.15 Real Property. 3.15.1 The Company does not own any
real property and has not ever owned any real property, nor is the Company
party to any Contract to purchase or sell any real property. 3.15.2 Section
3.15.2 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of
all leases, lease guaranties, subleases, or other Contracts for the leasing,
use or occupancy of, or otherwise granting a right in or relating to any real
property (the "Leased Real Property"), together with all amendments and
modifications thereto (collectively, the "Lease Agreements"). The Lease
Agreements grant leasehold estates free and clear of all Liens. The Lease
Agreements are in full force and effect and are binding and enforceable
against each of the parties thereto in accordance with their respective terms,
subject to Laws of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and
the relief of debtors and rules of law governing specific performance,
injunctive relief and other equitable remedies. Neither the Company nor, to
the Knowledge of the Company, any other party to a Lease Agreement, is in
breach or default under any Lease Agreement, nor has there occurred any event
that with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute
a breach or default. No construction, alteration or other leasehold
improvement work with respect to the real property covered by any Lease
Agreement remains to be paid for or to be performed by the Company, and the
Company would not be reasonably likely to be required to expend more than
$10,000 in performing alterations or construction to cause any Leased Real
Property to comply with the surrender conditions set forth in the applicable
Lease Agreement. The Company currently occupies all of the Leased Real
Property for the operation of its business, and there are no other parties
occupying, or with a right to occupy, the Leased Real Property. 3.15.3 Each
Leased Real Property is in good operating condition and repair and is suitable
for the conduct of the business as presently conducted therein. Neither the
operation of the Company on the Leased Real Property nor, to the Company's
Knowledge, such Leased Real Property, violate any Law relating to such
property or operations thereon. The Company has performed all of its
obligations under any agreements pursuant to which it has terminated any
leases of real property that are no longer in effect and has no continuing
liability with respect to such terminated real property leases. The Company is
not party to any agreement or subject to any claim that may require the
payment of any real estate brokerage commissions, and no such commission is
owed with respect to any of the Leased Real Property. The Company expects to
be able to 19  

  

 ![](exhibit21021.jpg) 

continue to have the right to occupy the Leased Real Property through the
remainder of the term of the applicable Lease Agreement. 3.16 Intellectual
Property. 3.16.1 The Company is the sole and exclusive owner of the entire and
unencumbered right, title, and interest in and to the Company Intellectual
Property other than the Inbound Licenses, and the Company has the valid right
to use the Licensed Intellectual Property pursuant to the terms of the
applicable IP Agreement. The Company has the right to use all other
Intellectual Property Rights necessary for the conduct of the business of the
Company as currently conducted. The Company Intellectual Property (other than
the Licensed Intellectual Property) and, to the Knowledge of the Company, the
Licensed Intellectual Property, is free and clear of any covenants not to sue,
Liens, joint ownership obligations or duties, Orders or any determination of
an arbiter placed by the Company or placed upon the Company's interest. The
Company Intellectual Property constitutes all of the Intellectual Property
used in the conduct of the business of the Company as currently conducted.
3.16.2 No royalties or other fees are payable by the Company (a) to any Person
for the use of or right to use any Company Intellectual Property or (b)
pursuant to the Grant Agreement. All Company Intellectual Property owned by
the Company and developed by employees of the Company or any independent

the scope of their employment, or (ii) by such independent contractors
providing services to the Company that have duly assigned their rights in such
Company Intellectual Property to the Company pursuant to enforceable written
agreements that comply with applicable Law to effectuate a valid assignment.
None of the Company Intellectual Property owned by the Company is involved in
any inventorship challenge, interference, reexamination, nullity, or
opposition proceeding. 3.16.3 The Company owns or possesses sufficient legal
rights to all Company Intellectual Property without any known conflict with,
or infringement or misappropriation of, the rights of others. To the Company's
Knowledge, no product or service marketed or sold (or proposed to be marketed
or sold) by the Company violates, misappropriates or infringes any
Intellectual Property Rights of any other party. 3.16.4 The Company has not
received any written communications alleging that the Company has violated,
infringed or misappropriated, or by conducting its business, would violate,
infringe or misappropriate any of the patents, trademarks, service marks,

or processes of any other Person. The Company has not received written notice
alleging that the use of any Company Intellectual Property or the conduct of
the business of the Company, as currently conducted, infringes upon, violates
or misappropriates any Intellectual Property of any other Person, nor is the
Company aware of any basis for such a claim. The Company is not a party to any
pending lawsuit or third-party claim alleging that the conduct of the
Company's business or any Company Product infringes upon or violates the
Intellectual Property of any other Person. 3.16.5 To the Knowledge of the
Company, no Person is misappropriating, infringing or violating any Company
Intellectual Property, nor is the Company aware of any basis for such a claim.
3.16.6 To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company has obtained and possesses
valid licenses to use all of the software programs present on the computers
and other software-enabled electronic devices that it owns or leases or that
it has otherwise provided to its employees for their use in connection with
the Company's business. To the Knowledge of the Company, it will not be
necessary to use any inventions of any of its employees or consultants (or
Persons it currently intends to hire) made prior to their employment by the
Company, except to the extent to which Company is granted such rights to use
pursuant to an Inbound License. Each employee and consultant has assigned to
the Company all Company Intellectual Property and copies of all such
assignments have been made available to Parent. 3.16.7 Section 3.16.7 of the
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of all registered

forth all Contracts under which the Company is granted any right under any
material Intellectual Property Rights of any other Person (collectively,
"Inbound Licenses"), other than any non-disclosure agreements, off-the-shelf
software licenses, and Standard Form Agreements. 3.16.12 Section 3.16.12 of
the Disclosure Schedule lists all Contracts to which the Company is a party
and under which the Company has licensed, provided or assigned or granted any
right to any Company Intellectual Property to third parties ("Outbound

Person, other than pursuant to the Outbound Licenses or Standard Form
Agreements. 3.16.13 The Company is not in breach or default under the terms of
any IP Agreement and there exists no event, condition or occurrence that (with

neither the enforceability nor any of the terms or provisions of any IP
Agreement will be affected in any manner by, the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. 3.16.14 The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
not result in the loss or impairment of the Company's ownership or other
rights in and to any of the Company Intellectual Property or under any of the
IP Agreements, require the Company to grant to any third party any right to
any Company Intellectual Property or obligate the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent to pay any royalties or other amounts to any third party
in excess of any amounts payable to such third parties prior to the Closing,
nor will 21

study of any products currently under development by the Company. To the
Company's Knowledge, no act, omission, event, or circumstance relating to the
Company's activities and conduct would reasonably be expected to give 23

or replacement, safety alert, warning, health professional notification,
clinical investigator notice, or other notice or action relating to an alleged
or suspected lack of safety, efficacy or regulatory compliance of any Company
Product. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts which are
reasonably likely to cause (i) the recall, field notification or correction,
market withdrawal or replacement, safety alert, warning, health care
professional notification, or clinical investigator notice relating to any
Company Product sold or intended to be sold by the Company; (ii) a change in
the marketing classification or a material change in the labeling of any such

has purchased any services, products, or Technology from, or sold or furnished
any services, products or technology to, the Company (each a "Related Party

contained in this Agreement, any annex, exhibit or schedule to this Agreement,
including the Disclosure Schedule, any other Transaction Agreement, any

shall agree to take any action which could reasonably be expected to delay the
consummation of the Merger or result in the failure to satisfy any condition
to consummation of Transactions (including the Merger). 5.3.2 Governmental
Authorities. Each of the Parties (other than the Stockholders' Representative)
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (a) cooperate with each other
in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions (including the Merger),
including any proceeding initiated by a private party and (b) keep the other
Parties informed in all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of
any material communication received by such party from, or given by such party
to, any Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or
given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding any of the Transactions. 5.3.3 Contractual Consents. The Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary
consents, waivers and approvals of any parties to any Material Contracts as
are required thereunder or for any such Material Contracts to remain in full
force and effect, so as to preserve all material rights of and material
benefits to, the Company under such Material Contract from and after the
Effective Time. Such consents, waivers and approvals shall be in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent. 5.3.4 Cancellation or Exercise of
Company Warrants. The Company shall make commercially reasonable efforts to
(a) cancel the Company Warrants (other than the Company Warrant issued to
Pacific Western Bank) pursuant to a form mutually approved by the Company and
the Parent (the "Warrant Cancellation Agreement") or (b) amend the Company
Warrants (other than the Company Warrant issued to Pacific Western Bank)
pursuant to a form mutually approved by the Company and the Parent (the
"Warrant First Amendment"), in each case, before the Closing. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall take the following actions:
(i) contact the holders of each such Company Warrant within 48 hours of the
signing of this Agreement in a manner and with such information reasonably
calculated to result in their approval and execution of the Warrant First
Amendment or the Warrant Cancellation Agreement, in each case, before Closing,
(ii) offer each holder of a Company Warrant the opportunity to have Parent's
Chief Financial Officer (or other representative selected by Parent)
participate in discussions regarding amending or cancelling the Warrants, and
unless such holder expressly objects, allow Parent's Chief Financial Officer
(or other representative selected by Parent) to be party to all such
communication (e.g. participate in phone calls and copy on related e-mail),
and (iii) approve and countersign each Warrant First Amendment or Warrant
Cancellation Agreement approved by a holder of a Company Warrant. 5.4 Public
Announcements. Neither the Company nor Parent shall (nor shall either permit
any of its Representatives or Affiliates to), directly or indirectly, make any
statement or communication to any third party regarding the existence of the
subject matter of this Agreement or the Transactions (including the Merger)
(including any claim or dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or
the interpretation, entering into, performance, breach or termination hereof)
without the prior written consent of other Party; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding anything herein or in the Confidentiality agreement to the
contrary, before the Closing, Parent and its Representatives may make public
statements of any information that it believes, in good faith, is required by
applicable Law (including stock exchange rules), and at any time following the
Closing, Parent and its Representatives may issue such press releases or make
such other public statements regarding this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby as Parent may, in its sole discretion, decide to issue or
make. For the avoidance of doubt, at any time, Parent and its Representatives
may file this Agreement and disclose the terms of the transactions
contemplated hereby as may be required by applicable Law, including in
Parent's Securities Act and Exchange Act reports and filings. 30  

  

 ![](exhibit21032.jpg) 

5.5 Access to Information. 5.5.1 Access. Subject to the requirements of
applicable Law, the Company shall afford to Parent and it Representatives,
from time to time prior to the earlier of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the
termination of the Agreement in accordance with ARTICLE VII, access during
normal business hours to (a) all of the Company's facilities, books, reports,
Contracts, assets, filings with and applications to Governmental Authorities,
records and correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic
form) and (b) to the Representatives of the Company, as Parent may reasonably
request, and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent all information and
documents concerning its business, financial condition and operations,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request and Parent shall be

Financials. Promptly, but in no event later than 10 calendar days after the
end of each month from the Agreement Date until the Closing Date, the Company
shall provide Parent with a copy of the true and correct unaudited balance
sheets and related statements of income and cash flows of the Company as of
and for the period ended the most-recent month-end prepared using the
Company's books and records and in accordance with GAAP consistently applied,
together with a copy of the standard monthly reporting package provided to the
Company's management. 5.6 Confidentiality. The Stockholders' Representative on
behalf of the Stockholders acknowledges that the success of the Surviving
Corporation after the Closing Date depends upon the preservation of the
confidentiality of the Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined), that
the preservation of the confidentiality of the Confidential Information is an
essential premise of the bargain between the Parties and Parent and Merger Sub
would be unwilling to enter into this Agreement in the absence of this Section
5.6. Accordingly, Stockholders' Representative on behalf of the Stockholders
shall, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives to, keep confidential all
documents and information involving or relating to the Company or its business
(the "Confidential Information"), unless (a) compelled to disclose by
competent judicial process so long as reasonable prior notice of such
disclosure is given to Parent and the Company and a reasonable opportunity is
afforded Parent and the Company to contest the same or (b) disclosed in an
Action brought by a Party in pursuit of its rights or in the exercise of its
remedies (clauses (a) and (b) together, the "Confidential Information
Exceptions"). Confidential Information does not include any document or
information that is or becomes generally available to the public other than as
a result of a disclosure in violation of this Section 5.6. The provisions of
this Section 5.6 shall survive the Closing for a period of three (3) years
after the completion of the Stockholders' Representative's responsibilities in
connection with this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following Closing,
the Stockholders' Representative shall be permitted to: (i) after the public
announcement of the Merger, publicly announce that it has been engaged to
serve as the Stockholders' Representative in connection with the Merger as
long as such announcement does not disclose any of the other terms of the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated herein; and (ii) disclose
information as required by law or to employees, advisors, agents or
consultants of the Stockholders' Representative and to the Effective Time
Holders, in each case who have a need to know such information, provided that
such persons are subject to confidentiality obligations with respect thereto.
5.7 Notification of Certain Matters. Each of Parent and the Company shall
provide prompt written notice to the other upon becoming aware (a) that any
representation or warranty made by such Party in this Agreement was when made,
or subsequently has become, untrue, (b) of any failure by such Party to comply
with or satisfy any of its obligations, covenants or agreements hereunder, (c)
of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event that could reasonably be
expected to cause any condition precedent to any obligation of the other Party
to consummate the Transactions (including the Merger) not to be satisfied at
or prior to the Closing, (d) of any notice or other communication from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions (including the Merger), (e) of any notice or
other communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions (including the Merger), (f) of the commencement or threat of
commencement of any material Action regarding the Transactions (including the
Merger), or (g) of any other material development affecting its assets,
Liabilities, business, financial condition or operations that could be
reasonably expected to cause a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent
Material Adverse Effect, as applicable; provided, however, that neither the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.7 nor obtaining any
information or knowledge in any investigation pursuant to Section 5.5 or
otherwise shall (i) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any
representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter, or any breach  

  

 ![](exhibit21033.jpg) 

any other term of this Agreement, (ii) amend or supplement any representation
or warranty made by such Party in this Agreement or (iii) limit the rights of
or remedies available to the Party receiving, or entitled to receive, such
notice, including under ARTICLE VII and ARTICLE VIII. 5.8 Tax Matters. For
purposes of this Section 5.8, all references to the Company include any
predecessor entity of the Company. 5.8.1 Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns. (a)
The Company shall, at the Company's expense, prepare or cause to be prepared
and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company for all taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date and which are due on or before
the Closing Date and the Company shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes with
respect to such periods. The Surviving Corporation and Parent shall, at the
expense of the Effective Time Holders, prepare or cause to be prepared and
file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company for all taxable
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and which are due after the
Closing Date and the Effective Time Holders shall pay all expenses incurred by
the Surviving Corporation or Parent in connection therewith and all Taxes with
respect to such periods within 10 days of the filing of the Tax Return for
which such Taxes are due. All Tax Returns referred to in this Section 5.8.1
shall be prepared in accordance with past practices of the Company and paid at
least 10 days before they are due. The Company shall submit each Tax Return it
prepared or caused to be prepared to Parent at least 30 days before such Tax
Return is due for Parent's written approval prior to filing, and Parent shall
submit each Tax Return it or the Surviving Corporation prepared or caused to
be prepared to the Stockholders' Representative at least 30 days before such
Tax Return is due for the Stockholders' Representative's review and reasonable
comment. (b) The expenses and Taxes that the Effective Time Holders are
required to pay pursuant Section 5.8.1(a) shall be paid, first, through the
forfeiture and cancellation of the Holdback Shares in accordance with Section
8.3.10, second, to the extent the value of the Holdback Shares are
insufficient to pay the amount required to be paid, through the forfeiture of
any cash then held by Parent as contemplated by Section 2.15, and third, to
the extent such cash is insufficient to pay the amount required to be paid,
directly by the Effective Time Holders, in each case, in accordance with their
Pro Rata Share. 5.8.2 Post-Closing and Straddle Period Tax Returns. (a) Parent
shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax
Returns of the Company for taxable periods that end after the Closing Date,
including all Tax Returns for all complete taxable periods including but not
ending on the Closing Date (collectively, the "Straddle Periods") and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay all Taxes with respect to such
periods. Parent shall permit the Stockholders' Representative a reasonable
period of time, but not less than 30 days to review and comment, prior to
filing, on each Tax Return for a Straddle Period. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall consider in good faith any changes to such Straddle Period
Tax Returns that are reasonably requested by the Stockholders' Representative
with respect to Taxes for which the Effective Time Holders would bear
liability pursuant to this Agreement. The Effective Time Holders shall
reimburse Parent for any Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns filed
pursuant to this Section 5.8.2 in accordance with Section 5.8.1(b) mutatis
mandis. (b) In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of Taxes allocable
to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be
determined as follows: In the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such
as real or personal property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the entire
period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the
amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle
Period. In the case of Taxes not described in the previous sentence (such as
franchise Taxes, Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts,
based upon occupancy or imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer
or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)), the
amount of any such Taxes shall be determined as if such taxable period ended
as of the close of business on the Closing Date. 5.8.3 Tax Contests. If a
claim shall be made by any Taxing Authority, which, if successful, might
result in an indemnity payment to an Indemnified Person pursuant to ARTICLE
VIII, then such Indemnified Person 32  

  

 ![](exhibit21034.jpg) 

shall give notice to the Indemnifying Party in writing of such claim and of
any counterclaim the Indemnified Person proposes to assert (a "Tax Claim");
provided, however, the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
has been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. With respect to
any Tax Claim relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Stockholders'
Representative shall, solely at the Effective Time Holders' cost and expense,
control all proceedings in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection
of counsel); provided, however, that the Stockholders' Representative must
first consult, in good faith with Parent before taking any action with respect
to the conduct of such Tax Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Stockholders' Representative shall not settle such Tax Claim without the prior
written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
and Parent and counsel of its own choosing (at the Effective Time Holders'
cost) shall have the right to participate fully in all aspects of the
prosecution or defense of such Tax Claim if Parent reasonably determines that
such Tax Claim could have a material adverse impact on the Taxes of the
Company (or the Surviving Corporation or Parent) in a taxable period or
portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date. The cost required to be paid
by the Effective Time Holders' in accordance with the preceding sentence shall
be paid in accordance with Section 5.8.1(b) mutatis mandis. Parent shall
control all proceedings with respect to any Tax Claim relating to a taxable
period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date and the Effective
Time Holders shall have no right to participate in the conduct of any such
proceeding. 5.8.4 Certification. Parent and the Company agree, upon request
from the other party, to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any certificate or other document from any Taxing Authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could
be imposed (including with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger)). 5.8.5 Tax Sharing Agreements. The Company
shall terminate all Tax Sharing Agreements with respect to the Company as of
the Closing Date and shall ensure that such agreements are of no further force
or effect on and after the Closing Date and that there shall be no further
liabilities or obligations imposed on the Company under any such agreements.
5.8.6 Cooperation. Following the Closing Date, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Stockholders' Representative shall, as reasonably
requested by any party hereto: (a) assist any other Party in preparing and
filing any Tax Returns relating to the Company that such other Party is
responsible for preparing and filing; (b) cooperate in preparing for any Tax
Claim, Tax audit of, or dispute with any Taxing Authority regarding and any
judicial or administrative proceeding relating to, liability for Taxes, in the
preparation or conduct of litigation or investigation of claims and in
connection with the preparation of financial statements or other documents to
be filed with any Taxing Authority, in each case with respect to the Company;
(c) make available to the other parties and to any Taxing Authority as
reasonably requested all information, records and documents in such Party's
possession relating to Taxes relating to the Company (at the cost and expense
of the requesting Party); (d) provide timely notice to the other Parties in
writing of any pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments relating to the
Company for taxable periods for which any such other Party is responsible; and
(e) furnish the other Parties with copies of all correspondence received from
any Taxing Authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request
with respect to any taxable periods for which any such other Party is
responsible. For the avoidance of doubt, the cooperation noted in this Section
5.8.6 shall include signing any Tax Returns, amended Tax Returns, claims or
other documents with respect to any Tax controversy or proceeding, with
respect to Taxes, the retention and (upon the other Party's request) the
provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such
audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. 5.8.7 No Section 338 Tax Election. Neither
Parent nor its Affiliates shall make a Tax election pursuant to Section 338 of
the Code or any similar election under state, local or foreign Tax Law with
respect to the Company in connection with the Merger. 5.8.8 Transfer Taxes.
The Effective Time Holders, severally and not jointly, shall be liable for any
real property transfer or gains tax, stamp tax, stock transfer tax, or other
similar Tax imposed as a result of the Merger (collectively, the "Transfer
Taxes"), and any penalties or interest with respect to the Transfer Taxes. The
Parties (other than the Stockholders' Representative) shall cooperate in
filing all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to the
Transfer Taxes. Any such Transfer Taxes shall be paid by the Surviving 33  

  

 ![](exhibit21035.jpg) 

Corporation, and Parent shall be entitled to withhold any Contingent
Consideration Payments to set off against any such Transfer Taxes paid by the
Surviving Corporation. 5.8.9 Stockholders' Liability for Payment Obligations.
The Effective Time Holders, severally and not jointly, shall be liable for all
Taxes or other amounts payable by the Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement
5.8.10 336(e) Election. Without the prior written consent of the Parent (which
may be withheld for any reason), neither the Company nor the Effective Time
Holders shall make a Tax election pursuant to Section 336(e) of the Code or
any similar election under state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the
Merger. 5.9 Intentionally Omitted. 5.10 Employee Matters. 5.10.1 Employees.

with respect to the employment or termination of all Employees prior to the

prior to the Closing, including worker's compensation benefits with respect to
injuries or incidents occurring prior to the Closing, any paid time-off and
sick or vacation amounts due or granted by the Company to any Employees prior
to the Closing as well as any amounts due to any Employees resulting from any
Company Plans. Nothing in this Agreement shall give rise to any obligation by
Parent to retain any Employee, any group of Employees of the Company or any
Company Plan following the Closing Date. At or prior to the Closing, the
Company shall terminate the employment of all Employees. The Company shall pay
all unused vacation benefits earned or accrued by Employees through the
Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement shall give rise to any obligation by
Parent to retain any Employee or to offer employment to any Employee or any
group of Employees, or to maintain any Company Plan from and after the
Closing. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company will terminate all
Employees. 5.10.2 Company Plans. At Parent's request, the Company shall cease
contributions to or terminate one of more of the Company Plans effective
immediately prior to the Closing. Any such cessation or termination may only
be undertaken (i) in accordance with the governing documents and Contracts for
the Company Plans (including through plan amendment) and (ii) if such
cessation or termination conforms with applicable Laws. 5.10.3 No Third-Party
Beneficiaries. This Section 5.10 is not intended to amend any benefit plans or
arrangements of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, to limit the ability of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate any of such
benefit plans or arrangements or to confer third-party beneficiary rights on
any Person who is not a Party. 5.11 Intentionally Omitted. 5.12 No
Negotiations, Etc. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Representatives
and the Stockholders and their respective Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly solicit, initiate, or enter into any discussions or negotiations or
continue in any way any discussions or negotiations with any Person or group
of Persons regarding any Competing Transaction (defined below). The Company
shall promptly but not later than 48 hours of the occurrence of the relevant
event notify Parent orally and in writing if any inquiries, proposals, or
requests for information concerning a Competing Transaction are received by
the Company, any of the Stockholders or any of their respective
Representatives. The written notice shall include the identity of the Person
making such inquiry, proposal, or request and the terms and conditions thereof
as well as a copy of such inquiry proposal or request. "Competing Transaction"
means a transaction or a series of related transactions (other than the
Transactions, including the Merger) involving (i) any sale of stock or other
equity interests in the Company, (ii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, or other similar transaction involving the Company (iii)
any sale, lease, exchange, exclusive license, mortgage, pledge, transfer, or
other disposition of 10% or more of the assets of the Company or (iv) any

the consummation of the Transactions (including the Merger). 5.13
Intentionally Omitted. 5.14 Termination of Agreements. Prior to the Closing,
the Company shall terminate all Contracts listed on Schedule 5.14 (the
"Terminated Contracts") pursuant to documents in form and substance reasonably  

  

 ![](exhibit21036.jpg)

connection therewith, such that each such Terminated Contract shall be of no
further force or effect at and after the Closing, in each case, without any
remaining Liability of any kind to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent as a result of or in connection with such termination. 5.15 Release of
Claims. Effective as of the Effective Date, each Effective Time Holder on
behalf of itself and each of its equity holders (if any) and each of their
respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates, employees, agents, advisors, heirs, legal
representatives, successors and assigns (each a "Releasor"), pursuant to its
Joinder, Letter of Transmittal, or both, shall completely release, acquit and
forever discharge, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Company and each of their respective Affiliates and
each of their respective current, former and future officers, directors,
employees, agents, advisors, successors and assigns (collectively, the
"Releasees") from any losses, liabilities, suits, actions, debts or rights,
whether fixed or contingent, known or unknown, matured or unmatured, arising
out of, relating to, or in any manner connected with any facts, events or
circumstances, or any actions taken, at or prior to the consummation of the
Transactions (including the Merger) that any Releasor ever had or now has
against the Releasees (collectively, the "Released Matters"), excluding any
liabilities arising solely in relation to the Transactions (including the
Merger) (collectively, the "Release of Claims"). Pursuant to the Joinders,
Letters of Transmittal, or both, each Effective Time Holder will (a) represent
and warrant that such Effective Time Holder has (i) had the opportunity to
consult with legal counsel of its choice, (ii) been fully informed of the
nature and contents of its Release of Claims and (ii) entered into such
Release of Claims freely, (b) acknowledged that it would be difficult to fully
compensate Parent or any of its Affiliates for damages resulting from any
breach of the provisions of such Release of Claims. Accordingly, in the event
of any actual or threatened breach of such provisions, Parent and its
Affiliates shall (in addition to any other remedies that it may have) be
entitled to seek temporary and/or permanent injunctive relief to enforce such
provisions and recover related attorneys' fees and costs. Each Effective Time
Holder will further acknowledge in its respective Joinder, Letter of
Transmittal, or both, that its Release of Claims constitutes a material
inducement to Parent to consummate the Transactions (including the Merger) and
Parent will be relying on the enforceability of such Release of Claims in
consummating the Transactions. 5.16 Status of Shares. 5.16.1 The shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable to the Effective Time Holders as contemplated

Secretary's designee, to hold such Assignment Separate from Certificate, along
with the certificate(s) evidencing such Effective Time Holder's Holdback
Shares, in escrow and to take all such actions and to effectuate all such
forfeitures, transfers and/or releases as are in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. 5.16.7 Except to the extent there is a forfeiture and
cancellation of Holdback Shares in connection with Losses in accordance with
ARTICLE VIII or pursuant to and in accordance with Section 5.8, the applicable
Effective Time Holder will be shown as the registered owner of its Holdback
Shares on the certificate(s) evidencing such shares and on the books and
records of Parent, the Holdback Shares shall be treated by Parent as issued
and outstanding Parent Common Stock, and the Effective Time Holders shall be
entitled to exercise voting rights, receive allocations of taxable items,

taxable stock dividends, which shall be retained by Parent and included as
part of the Remaining Holdback Value, serving as partial security of the
indemnification obligations under ARTICLE VIII) and exercise other rights of

Charter Documents. To the extent any Holdback Shares are cancelled by Parent
and forfeited by Effective Time Holder in connection with Losses in accordance
with ARTICLE VIII or pursuant to and in accordance with Section 5.8, such
forfeited shares shall no longer be considered issued and outstanding, and the
Stockholders shall have no further rights in such forfeited Holdback Shares.

Parent shall, subject to any limitations imposed by the SEC or its staff on
the number of shares that may be registered for resale by the Stockholders and
subject to applicable SEC guidance, register the Closing Shares under the

issuable under this Agreement to the Stockholders (the "Registrable
Securities"). Parent shall take all necessary action to cause the Registration
Statement to be declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable after the
filing thereof with the SEC (and in any event within 60 days after the filing
thereof). Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the

has executed a board observer agreement in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent. Parent shall reimburse such person for all reasonable
travel and other expenses associated with attending such meetings in
accordance with Parent's policies for the same regarding its directors. 5.20

within 10 calendar days after written notice thereof to the Company; provided,
however, that no cure period shall be required (i) for a breach or inaccuracy
which by its nature cannot be cured or (ii) if any of the conditions in

on or before the Outside Date; 7.1.5 By the Company if it is not in material
breach of its obligations under this Agreement and there has been a breach of
or inaccuracy in any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent
contained in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Sections

inaccuracy and such breach or inaccuracy has not been cured within 10 calendar
days after written notice thereof to Parent; provided, however, that no cure

cannot be cured or (ii) if any of the conditions in Sections 6.2 or 6.3 for
the benefit of the Company are incapable of being satisfied on or before the
Outside Date; or 7.1.6 By Parent, if a Company Material Adverse Effect occurs.
7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 7.1, this Agreement shall become null and void (other than this
Section 7.2, Sections 5.4, 5.6, and 8.4.5, and ARTICLE IX and any provision
hereof that forms the basis for a claim of breach of this Agreement prior to
the termination of this Agreement, all of which shall survive termination of

on the part of the Parties or any of their respective directors, officers or

of this Agreement prior to the termination of this Agreement. 40  

  

 ![](exhibit21042.jpg) 

ARTICLE VIII: SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION 8.1 Survival. All representations
and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement or in any other document, certificate, schedule or
instrument delivered or executed in connection hereunder or thereunder will
survive the Closing until 11:59 p.m. (California time) on the date that is the
18-month anniversary of the Closing Date or such later time as such period may
be extended by tolling periods and other extensions (the "Initial Survival
Date"); provided however that the representations and warranties contained in
(a) Section 3.9 shall survive until 11:59 p.m. (California time) on the date
that is 30 days following expiration of the applicable statute of limitations;
and (b) Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.14, 3.16 and 3.21 (collectively, the
"Company Special Representations"), will survive for a period of 7 years after
the Closing Date or such later time as may be extended by tolling periods and
other extensions and (c) all of the covenants and agreements of the Parties
contained in this Agreement or any other document, certificate, schedule or

"Survival Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a claim or notice with
respect to recovery under the indemnification provisions hereof is given in
accordance with the terms hereof prior to the applicable Survival Date, the
claim and any representations and warranties or covenants or agreement
underlying such claim, shall continue until such claim is finally resolved
pursuant to the terms of this ARTICLE VIII. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, claims relating to Fraud, Willful Breach or
Intentional Misrepresentation shall survive indefinitely. For the avoidance of
doubt, it is the intention of the Parties that the foregoing respective
survival periods and termination dates supersede any applicable statutes of
limitations that would otherwise apply to such representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements under applicable Law. 8.2 Indemnification. 8.2.1
Indemnification by Effective Time Holders. Subject to the terms, conditions
and limitations of this ARTICLE VIII: (a) From and after and by virtue of the

Company Special Representations) made by the Company in this Agreement or in
any other Transaction Agreement to which it is a party, including in any
certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant hereto; (ii) any
breach of, or misrepresentation or inaccuracy (or any Third Party Claim

this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement; (iv) (A) any Tax imposed on
the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (B) any Tax of any member of an

pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar state, local,
or foreign law), (C) any Tax for a Pre-Closing Tax Period of any Person for
which the Company is liable as a transferee or successor, by contract,
pursuant to any Law or otherwise, (D) the liability of the Effective Time
Holders for Transfer Taxes pursuant to Section 5.8, (E) any and all Taxes
resulting from a breach of a covenant of the Effective Time Holders or the

 ![](exhibit21043.jpg) 

(v) any misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or any omission from, the
Consideration Payment Schedule, including any amounts set forth therein that

was entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of this Agreement that were
omitted from the Consideration Payment Schedule; (vi) any appraisal rights
exercised by any Stockholder; (vii) any Liabilities relating to or arising out
of any "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the

committed by any Stockholder or the Company, including any director, officer
or employee of the Company, in connection with the negotiation and execution
of this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements and the consummation of
the Transactions (including the Merger). (b) From and after and by virtue of
the Merger, each Effective Time Holder severally and not jointly shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Parent Indemnified Persons from and
against any and all Losses suffered, sustained or incurred by any such Parent
Indemnified Person, whether or not involving a Third Party Claim, caused by,
in connection with, as a result of or arising out of: (i) any breach of, or
misrepresentation or inaccuracy (or any Third Party Claim alleging facts that,
if true, would be a breach of, misrepresentation or inaccuracy) in any of the
representations or warranties made by such Effective Time Holder in his, her
or its Joinder or in any other Transaction Agreement to which he, she or it is
a party; and (ii) any breach of or failure by such Effective Time Holder to
perform any covenant or agreement of such Effective Time Holder provided for
in its Joinder. 8.2.2 Indemnification by the Parent. Subject to the terms,
conditions and limitations of this ARTICLE VIII, Parent shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Stockholder Indemnified Persons from and against
any and all Losses suffered, sustained or incurred by such Stockholder
Indemnified Person, whether or not involving a Third Party Claim, caused by,
in connection with, as a result of or arising out of: (a) any breach of, or
misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, any of the representations or warranties
made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement, including in any certificate
delivered by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant hereto; and (b) any
breach of or failure to perform any covenants or agreements of Parent or
Merger Sub provided for in this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement
to which it is a party; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any Effective Time Holder for any payment inaccuracy if
such payment is made in accordance with the Consideration Payment Schedule.
8.2.3 General Limitations on Claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) the
aggregate amount that may be recovered by (i) the Parent Indemnified Persons
for Losses under Section 8.2.1(a)(i) shall not exceed the Cap Amount, and (ii)
the Stockholder Indemnified Persons for Losses under Section 8.2.2(a) shall
not exceed the Cap Amount; provided, however, that the indemnification
obligations of the Effective Time Holders and Parent with respect to Losses
arising from or relating to any Fraud, Willful Breach or Intentional
Misrepresentation shall not be subject to the Cap Amount (provided, further,
however, that no Effective Time Holder who did not (a) commit or make such
Fraud, Willful 42  

  

 ![](exhibit21044.jpg) 

Breach or Intentional Misrepresentation, or (b) have actual knowledge of such
Fraud, Willful Breach or Intentional Misrepresentation, shall have any
liability to any Indemnified Person in connection with any such Fraud, Willful
Breach or Intentional Misrepresentation in excess of such Effective Time
Holder's Pro Rata Share of the Cap Amount); (b) solely for purposes of
determining the amount of any Losses indemnifiable hereunder, all
qualifications or exceptions in any representation or warranty, or covenant,
referring to the terms "material," "materiality," "in all material respects,"
"Company Material Adverse Effect," or "Parent Material Adverse Effect" shall
be disregarded; and (c) notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Losses to be paid pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII shall not include
punitive damages except to the extent such damages are actually paid to a
third party. 8.2.4 Stockholder Limitation. Except with respect to Losses by
reason of any claims brought on the basis of Fraud, Willful Breach or
Intentional Misrepresentation, in no event shall the Parent Indemnified
Persons have the right under this Agreement to recover from any Effective Time
Holder any amounts in excess of the Closing Shares and any Contingent
Consideration paid or payable to such Effective Time Holder hereunder. 8.3
Claims for Indemnification; Resolution of Conflicts. 8.3.1 Direct Claims for
Indemnification. Subject to the limitations set forth above, any Parent
Indemnified Person or Stockholder Indemnified Person (as represented by
Stockholders' Representative) (each, an "Indemnified Person") may seek
recovery of Losses pursuant to this Section 8.3.1 not involving a Third Party
Claim by delivering to Stockholders' Representative (on behalf of the
Stockholder Indemnifying Parties) or Parent (each, an "Indemnifying Party", in
the case of the Stockholders' Representative, except for obligations to make
or rights to receive any payments, which obligations and rights shall belong
solely to the Stockholder Indemnifying Parties) as applicable, a notice (a)
stating that an Indemnified Person has paid, sustained, suffered or incurred a
Loss, and (b) specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the Loss,
including an estimate (if reasonably apparent) of the amount of the Loss
(each, an "Indemnification Claim Notice"); provided, however that (1) the
Indemnification Claim Notice need only specify such information to the
knowledge of such Indemnified Person as of the date such Indemnification Claim
Notice is delivered, (2) shall not limit any of the rights or remedies of any
Indemnified Person except to the extent that a material omission or
misstatement was knowingly made in bad faith by such Indemnified Person and
the Indemnifying Party shall have been materially prejudiced thereby and (3)
may be updated and amended from time to time by the Indemnified Person by
delivering an updated or amended Indemnification Claim Notice as provided for
in the preceding sentence. All claims for indemnification under this Section
8.3 (i) by any Stockholder Indemnified Person may only be made on behalf of
such Stockholder Indemnified Person by Stockholders' Representative and (ii)
against any Stockholder Indemnifying Party shall be addressed to Stockholders'
Representative. The Indemnifying Party may object to a claim for
indemnification set forth in an Indemnification Claim Notice by delivering a
notice (an "Objection Notice") to the Indemnified Person seeking
indemnification within 30 days of the delivery of the applicable
Indemnification Claim Notice (the "Indemnification Claim Objection Deadline"),
setting forth in reasonable detail the objections to the claim. If the
Indemnifying Party either notifies the applicable Indemnified Person that it
does not object or does not object in writing by the Indemnification Claim
Objection Deadline, such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable
acknowledgment that the Indemnified Person is entitled to the full amount of
the claims set forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice (any such claim, an
"Unobjected Claim"). In the event the amount of Losses recoverable by any
Parent Indemnified Person in respect of any Unobjected Claim is equal to or
less than the value of the Holdback Shares that remain restricted pursuant to
this Agreement and that have not previously been forfeited by the Effective
Time Holders in satisfaction of a prior indemnifiable claim hereunder (any
such Holdback Shares, as of a particular date, the "Remaining Holdback
Shares," and any such amount, together with any non-taxable unit dividends
paid in respect of Holdback Shares, as of a particular date, the "Remaining
Holdback Value"), Parent shall be entitled to cancel, and Effective Time
Holders shall forever forfeit, based on such Effective Time Holder's Pro Rata
Share, any right to such number of Holdback Shares pursuant to this Agreement
equal to the amount of the Losses with respect to the claims in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. In the event the amount of Losses
recoverable by any Parent Indemnified Persons in respect of any Unobjected
Claim exceeds the value of the Remaining Holdback Value, or if such Unobjected
Claim relates to a claim for recovery directly from an Indemnifying Party, (i)
first, Parent shall cancel the number of remaining 43  

  

 ![](exhibit21045.jpg) 

Holdback Shares held by the Effective Time Holders, based on each such
Effective Time Holder's Pro Rata Share, as corresponds to the amount of such
Losses represented by the Remaining Holdback Value, unless the Unobjected
Claims relates to a claim for recovery directly from an Indemnifying Party in
the first instance and (ii) second Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to, within 10 Business Days after the Indemnification Claim Objection
Deadline or as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter, notify the
Indemnifying Parties of their indemnification obligations with respect to such
Unobjected Claim, and each such Indemnifying Party shall promptly, and in no
event later than 15 Business Days after delivery of any such notice by Parent
to such Indemnifying Party, wire transfer to Parent, on behalf of the
applicable Indemnified Parties, an amount of cash equal to the amount of
Losses so owed by such Indemnifying Party based on such Effective Time
Holder's Pro Rata Share and not otherwise satisfied by forfeiture of Holdback
Shares pursuant to clause (i) above. 8.3.2 Resolution of Conflicts. (a) If an
Indemnifying Party timely delivers an Objection Notice in accordance with
Section 8.3.1, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Person(s) shall
attempt in good faith for 30 days to resolve such dispute. If the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Person(s) reach an agreement with respect to such
dispute, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and
signed by the parties (a "Settlement Memorandum"). (b) If the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Person(s) are unable to resolve such dispute during
such 30-day period, any party to such dispute may institute dispute resolution
proceedings in accordance with Sections 9.13 and 9.14 with respect to the
matter. Any final and non-appealable written decision, judgment or award
rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction as to the validity and amount of
any claim in such Indemnification Claim Notice shall be final, binding, and
conclusive upon the parties to such dispute and any other Indemnifying Parties
and Indemnified Persons. 8.3.3 Third-Party Claims. (a) In the event that any
Action is instituted, or that any claim is asserted, by any Person not party
to this Agreement in respect of an indemnifiable matter hereunder (a "Third
Party Claim"), the Indemnified Person seeking indemnification for any related
Loss shall notify the Indemnifying Party of any such Action or claim promptly
after receiving notice thereof (each, a "Third Party Indemnification Claim
Notice"); provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified
Person in giving any such notice shall relieve an Indemnifying Party of any
indemnification obligations unless, and only to the extent that, such
Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by such delay and
then only to the extent of such prejudice. Subject to the provisions of this
Section 8.3.3, and assuming the Indemnified Person does not have the right to
elect or does not choose to elect in its Third Party Indemnification Claim
Notice to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with
clause (d) of this Section 8.3.3, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled at
its own expense (in the case of the Stockholders' Representative, solely on
behalf of the Effective Time Holders) to conduct and control the defense and
settlement of such Third Party Claim on behalf of the Indemnified Person
through counsel chosen by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnified Person if the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified
Person in writing within 30 days (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party
Claim so requires) of its intent to do so and confirms that the Indemnifying
Party shall be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Person against all
resulting Losses in accordance with this Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party
does not elect within 30 days (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party
Claim so requires) to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with
any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person may defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim with counsel of its
choice at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. (b) If the Indemnifying Party
elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third
Party Claim: (i) the Indemnifying Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to defend such Third Party Claim; (ii) the Indemnified Person, prior
to the period in which the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such
matter, may take such reasonable actions to preserve any and all rights with  

  

 ![](exhibit21046.jpg) 

respect to such matter, without such actions being construed as a waiver of
the Indemnified Person's rights to defense and indemnification pursuant to
this Agreement and without such actions being determinative of the amount of
any indemnifiable Losses, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party's
ability to defend such action is actually and materially prejudiced by such
actions; and (iii) the Indemnified Person may participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim with separate counsel at its own expense or, if so
requested by the Indemnifying Party or, if in the reasonable opinion of
counsel to the Indemnified Person, a conflict or potential conflict exists
between the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Party that would make such
separate representation advisable, at the reasonable expense of the
Indemnifying Party (in the case of the Stockholders' Representative, solely on
behalf of the Effective Time Holders). (c) In connection with this Section
8.3.3, the Parties agree to: (i) cooperate with each other in connection with
the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third Party Claim; (ii)
make available witnesses in a timely manner to provide testimony through
declarations, affidavits, depositions, or at hearing or trial and to work with
each other in preparation for such events consistent with deadlines dictated
by the particular Third Party Claim; (iii) preserve all documents and things
required by litigation hold orders pending with respect to particular Third
Party Claims; and (iv) provide such documents and things to each other,
consistent with deadlines dictated by a particular matter, as required by
legal procedure or court order, or if reasonably requested by another Party
hereto; provided that such cooperation referenced in clauses (i) through (iv)
shall not be required if it could reasonably be expected to result in a waiver
of any attorney-client, work product or other privilege, and provided further
that the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid production
of confidential information (consistent with Law), and to cause all
communications among Employees, counsel and others representing any party to a
Third Party Claim to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client
or work-product privileges. (d) Except as permitted in this Section 8.3.3, the
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified
Person(s) (such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed), settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or permit a default or
consent to entry of any judgment (each a "Settlement"); provided, however,
that an Indemnified Person's written consent shall not be required if (i) the
claimant provides such Indemnified Person an unqualified release from all
liability in respect of the Third Party Claim, (ii) such Settlement does not
impose any additional liabilities or obligations on the Indemnified Person and
(iii) with respect to any non-monetary provision of such Settlement, such
provisions could not have, or be reasonably expected to have, any adverse
effect on the business, assets, financial condition or results of operations
of the Indemnified Person and its Subsidiaries, if any. Any Settlement or
compromise that does not comply with the preceding sentence shall not be
determinative of the amount of Losses with respect to any related claims for
indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII. The costs incurred by
Stockholders' Representative pursuant to participating in the defense of any
Third Party Claims shall constitute Stockholders' Representative Expenses. (e)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if (i) a Third
Party Claim seeks relief other than the payment of monetary damages, (ii) the
subject matter of a Third Party Claim relates to the ongoing business of the
Indemnified Person, which Third Party Claim, if decided against the
Indemnified Person, could adversely affect the ongoing business of the
Indemnified Person, (iii) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises
in connection with any criminal proceeding, action or indictment, or (iv) the
Indemnified Person reasonably concludes that the amount of the Third Party
Claim and associated defense costs shall exceed the limits on the Indemnifying
Party's obligations under Section 8.2.3(a) or the Indemnifying Party's
financial resources available to defend against the Third Party Claim, then,
in each such case, the Indemnified Person alone shall be entitled to contest,
defend and settle such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Person elects to
exercise such right to contest, defend and settle such Third Party Claim, 45  

  

 ![](exhibit21047.jpg) 

then the Indemnified Person shall notify the Indemnifying Party of such
election within 30 days of the later of (x) receiving the applicable Third
Party Indemnification Claim Notice or (y) the occurrence of the event giving
rise to the Indemnified Person's right to make such election pursuant to
clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 8.3.3(e). In such event, the
Indemnified Person shall instead have the right to be represented by counsel
of its choice (of which it shall notify the Indemnifying Party) at the
Indemnifying Party's reasonable expense and to defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Person
elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third
Party Claim, then (1) the Indemnified Person shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to defend such Third Party Claim, conduct such defense in a
good faith and reasonably diligent manner, keep the Indemnifying Party
reasonably informed of the status of such defense, and use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party with respect to
such defense during the course of such defense, and (2) the Indemnifying Party
may participate, at its own expense (in the case of the Stockholders'
Representative, solely on behalf of the Effective Time Holders), in the
defense of such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Person does not elect to
contest, defend and settle such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party
shall then have the right to contest and defend such Third Party Claim as
described above in Section 8.3.3(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Third
Party Claims in respect of Taxes shall be governed by Section 5.8.3 rather
than this Section 8.3.3. 8.3.4 Claims Unaffected by Investigation. The right
of an Indemnified Person to indemnification or to assert or recover on any
claim hereunder shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with
respect to, or any knowledge acquired or capable of being acquired, at any
time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the Closing, with respect to the accuracy of or compliance with any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements set forth in this
Agreement. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or agreement, shall not affect the right to indemnification or other
remedy based on such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. 8.3.5
Surviving Corporation. The Parties acknowledge and agree that if the Surviving
Corporation suffers, incurs or otherwise becomes subject to any Losses as a
result of or in connection with any misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, then (without
limiting any of the rights of the Surviving Corporation as an Indemnified
Person) Parent shall also be deemed, by virtue of its ownership of the stock
of the Surviving Corporation, to have incurred Losses as a result of and in
connection with such misrepresentation, inaccuracy or breach. 8.3.6 Cumulative
Remedies. The rights of the Parent Indemnified Persons and the Stockholder
Indemnified Persons under this ARTICLE VIII are cumulative, and each Parent
Indemnified Person and Stockholder Indemnified Person shall have the right in
its sole discretion to enforce any provision of this ARTICLE VIII without
regard to the availability of any other remedy under any other provision of
this Agreement. 8.3.7 Indemnification Adjusts Merger Consideration for Tax
Purposes. Each Party shall, including retroactively, treat indemnification
payments under this Agreement as adjustments to the Closing Shares and
Contingent Consideration for Tax purposes to the extent permitted under
applicable Law. 8.3.8 No Subrogation. No Effective Time Holder shall make any
claim for indemnification against either the Parent Indemnified Persons or the
Surviving Corporation based on the fact that such Effective Time Holder was a
controlling person, director, Employee or agent of the Company (whether such
claim is for Losses of any kind or otherwise and whether such claim is
pursuant to Law, a Charter Document, a Contract or otherwise) with respect to
any claim brought by a Parent Indemnified Person against any Effective Time
Holder under or relating to this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement
or the Transactions. With respect to any claim brought by a Parent Indemnified
Person against any Effective Time Holder under or relating to this Agreement,
any Transaction Agreement or the Transactions, each Effective Time Holder
expressly waives any right of subrogation, contribution, advancement,
indemnification or other claim against the Company with respect to any
indemnification obligation or any other liability to which such Effective Time
Holder may become subject under or in connection with this Agreement. 8.3.9
Set-Off. In addition to the remedy of set-off or other similar rights that
Parent or any Parent Indemnified Persons may have under common law or
otherwise, Parent shall have the right to withhold and 46  

  

 ![](exhibit21048.jpg) 

deduct any sum that may be owed to any Parent Indemnified Person under this
ARTICLE VIII from any amount otherwise payable to any Effective Time Holder
under any Transaction Agreement, including this Agreement and the agreements
entered into in connection with the Transaction. 8.3.10 Holdback Shares. (a)
If any Holdback Shares are used to satisfy any such indemnification
obligations, the value of each Holdback Share so used shall be deemed to be
the 5-Day Average over the five consecutive trading days ending on the trading
day immediately prior to the applicable claim is settled. (b) The value of the
Holdback Shares, as determined in accordance with Section 8.3.10(a), shall be
available to compensate the Parent Indemnified Persons for any claims by such
parties for any Losses suffered or incurred by them and for which they are
entitled to recovery under this ARTICLE VIII, which compensation will occur
through the forfeiture and cancellation of the Holdback Shares in accordance
with this Section 8.3.10. Each claim for Losses that is to be satisfied
through the forfeiture of a portion or all of the Holdback Shares pursuant to
this ARTICLE VIII shall be satisfied, as to each Indemnifying Party, by the
forfeiture and cancellation of such Indemnifying Party's Holdback Shares with
a value equal to such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Share of the Losses to be
so satisfied. Until and unless the Holdback Shares are released to the
Indemnifying Parties pursuant to Section 8.3.10(c), the Indemnifying Parties'
shall, and do hereby, pledge and grant a security interest in the Holdback
Shares to Parent on its own behalf and on behalf of the other Indemnified
Parties. Each Effective Time Holder will take all such actions to effectuate
all forfeitures and cancellations of any Holdback Share in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. (c) On the 18 month anniversary of the Effective Date
(the "Holdback Shares Release Date"), the Remaining Holdback Shares, if any,
less that number of Holdback Shares that is determined, in the reasonable
judgment of Parent, to be necessary to satisfy all unsatisfied or disputed
claims for indemnification delivered to the Stockholders' Representative on or
prior to the Holdback Shares Release Date (each, an "Unresolved Claim"), after
taking into account any non-taxable stock dividends retained by Parent
pursuant to Section 5.16.7 which shall also be retained pending resolution of
all Unresolved Claims (any such shares, the "Unresolved Claim Holdback
Shares"), shall be released by Parent to the Effective Time Holders in
proportion to their Pro Rata Share of the Remaining Holdback Value. The
Unresolved Claim Holdback Shares shall remain "Holdback Shares" past the
Holdback Shares Release Date subject to this Section 8.3.10(c). Any Unresolved
Claim Holdback Shares that are not forfeited by the Effective Time Holders and
cancelled by Parent based on an award to Parent upon the resolution of all
Unresolved Claims, shall be immediately released from such restrictions
following resolution of such Unresolved Claims and any non- taxable stock
dividends that continue to be retained by Parent pursuant to Section 5.16.7
and this Section 8.3.10(c) and not awarded to Parent upon the resolution of
such Unresolved Claims shall be distributed by Parent to the Effective Time
Holders as soon as practicable (and in no event later than five Business Days)
following resolution of such Unresolved Claims, whereupon such shares will no
longer be Holdback Shares. 8.4 Stockholders' Representative. 8.4.1
Appointment. By voting in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, or by
virtue of approving the principal terms of the Merger, the consummation of the
Merger or participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof,
including the right to receive the consideration payable in connection with
the Merger, and/or the execution of the Joinders or the Letter of Transmittal,
each Effective Time Holder shall be deemed to irrevocably nominate, constitute
and appoint, and hereby irrevocably nominates, constitutes and appoints,
Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the Stockholders' Representative
for all purposes in connection with this Agreement and the agreements
ancillary hereto, including, with full power of substitution, to act in the
name, place and stead of the Effective Time Holders for purposes of executing
any documents and taking any actions that Stockholders' Representative may, in
its sole discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate in
connection with any claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement
under this ARTICLE VIII or set-off in satisfaction of claims. Shareholder
Representative Services LLC hereby accepts its appointment as Stockholders'
Representative. 8.4.2 Authority. The Effective Time Holders grant to
Stockholders' Representative full authority to execute, deliver, acknowledge,
certify and file on behalf of each such Effective Time Holder (in the name of  

  

 ![](exhibit21049.jpg) 

or all of the Effective Time Holders or otherwise) any and all documents that
Stockholders' Representative may, in its sole discretion, determine to be
necessary, desirable or appropriate, in such forms and containing such
provisions as Stockholders' Representative may, in its sole discretion,
determine to be appropriate, in performing its duties as contemplated by this
Section 8.4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in
any other Transaction Agreement: (a) each Parent Indemnified Person shall be
entitled to deal exclusively with Stockholders' Representative on all matters
relating to any claim for indemnification, compensation, reimbursement or set
off under this Agreement; and (b) Parent, each Parent Indemnified Person and
each Effective Time Holder shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without
further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported
to be executed on behalf of any Effective Time Holder by Stockholders'
Representative and on any other action taken or purported to be taken on
behalf of any Effective Time Holder by Stockholders' Representative as fully
binding upon such Effective Time Holder. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of Stockholders' Representative, including an amendment, extension
or waiver of this Agreement in accordance with its terms shall constitute a
decision of the Effective Time Holders and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon the Effective Time Holders. Parent, Merger Sub, and the
Surviving Corporation may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or
instruction of Stockholders' Representative as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Effective Time Holders. Parent, Merger Sub, and
the Surviving Corporation are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person
for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction of Stockholders' Representative. 8.4.3 Power of Attorney. The
Effective Time Holders recognize and intend that the power of attorney granted
to the Stockholders' Representative: (a) is coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable; (b) may be delegated by Stockholders' Representative; and (c)
shall survive the death, dissolution or incapacity, as applicable, of each of
the Effective Time Holders. 8.4.4 Replacement. If Stockholders' Representative
is dissolved, resigns or is otherwise unable to fulfill its responsibilities
hereunder, the Effective Time Holders shall (by consent of those Persons
entitled to at least a majority of the Total Merger Consideration), within 10
days after such dissolution, resignation or inability, appoint a successor
Stockholders' Representative reasonably satisfactory to Parent. Any such
successor shall succeed the former Stockholders' Representative as
Stockholders' Representative hereunder. If for any reason there is no
Stockholders' Representative at any time, all references herein to
Stockholders' Representative shall be deemed to refer to the Effective Time
Holders who may take action by the written consent of Persons entitled to at
least a majority of the Total Merger Consideration. 8.4.5 Indemnification;
Stockholders' Representative Expenses. The Stockholders' Representative will
incur no liability of any kind with respect to any action or omission by the
Stockholders' Representative in connection with the Stockholders'
Representative's services pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements
ancillary hereto, except in the event of liability directly resulting from the
Stockholders' Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Stockholders' Representative shall not be liable for any action or omission
pursuant to the advice of counsel. The Effective Time Holders will indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Stockholders' Representative from and against any
and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel
and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication
and shipment) (collectively, "Stockholders' Representative Expenses") arising
out of or in connection with the Stockholders' Representative's execution and
performance of this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each
case as such Stockholders' Representative Expense is suffered or incurred;
provided, that in the event that any such Stockholders' Representative Expense
is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Stockholders' Representative, the Stockholders'
Representative will reimburse the Effective Time Holders the amount of such
indemnified Stockholders' Representative Expense to the extent attributable to
such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the
Stockholders' Representative by the Effective Time Holders, any such
Stockholders' Representative Expenses may be recovered by the Stockholders'
Representative from (i) the funds in the Expense Fund, (ii) from any Holdback
Shares at such time as such shares would otherwise be distributable to the
Effective Time Holders, and (iii) from any Contingent Consideration Payments
at such time as any such amounts would otherwise be distributable to the
Effective Time Holders; provided, that while this section allows the
Stockholders' Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of
funds, this does not relieve the Effective Time Holders from their obligation
to promptly pay such Stockholders' Representative Expenses as they are
suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent 48  

  

 ![](exhibit21050.jpg) 

the Stockholders' Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at
law or otherwise. In no event will the Stockholders' Representative be
required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Effective Time Holders or
otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of, or
provisions limiting the recourse against non-parties otherwise applicable to,
the Effective Time Holders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not
intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Stockholders'
Representative under this section. The foregoing indemnities will survive the
Closing, the resignation or removal of the Stockholders' Representative or the
termination of this Agreement. 8.4.6 Expense Fund. Upon the first Contingent
Consideration payment made to the Effective Time Holders (if any), a portion
of such Contingent Consideration payment in the amount of US$[***] (the
"Expense Fund") will be diverted to the Stockholders' Representative, which
will be used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the
Stockholders' Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this
Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto. The Effective Time Holders will
not receive any interest or earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably
transfer and assign to the Stockholders' Representative any ownership right
that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The
Stockholders' Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal of
the Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Stockholders' Representative will hold these funds separate
from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses
or any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds
available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable
following the completion of the Stockholders' Representative's
responsibilities, the Stockholders' Representative shall disburse any
remaining balance of the Expense Fund to the Effective Time Holders based on
such Effective Time Holders' Pro Rata Share, except in the case of payments to
employees or former employees of the Company for which employment tax
withholding is required, which such amounts shall be delivered to Parent or
the Surviving Corporation and paid through Parent's or Surviving Corporation's
payroll processing service or system. For tax purposes, the Expense Fund shall
be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by the Effective
Time Holders at the time the Expense Fund is delivered to the Stockholders'
Representative. The parties agree that the Stockholders' Representative is not
acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with
the Expense Fund. ARTICLE IX: GENERAL PROVISIONS 9.1 Notices. All notices,

Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by any of the Parties without the written consent of the
other Parties, except that Parent or Merger Sub may, without the prior consent
of any other Party, (a) assign any or all of its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Parent, (b) assign this
Agreement and any of its rights and obligations hereunder to the purchaser of
all or substantially all of its equity securities or assets by merger,
contract or otherwise in one transaction or a series of related transactions
and (c) collaterally assign this Agreement to any lender; provided that no
such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations
hereunder. Any assignment of this Agreement or any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder not permitted under this Section 9.2 shall be null and
void ab initio. Subject to the foregoing terms of this Section 9.2, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 9.3
Amendment or Supplement. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended at any time by execution of an instrument in writing
identifying itself as an amendment signed, when amended prior to the Closing,
by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and, when amended on or after the
Closing, by Parent and Stockholders' Representative. For purposes of this
Section 9.3, the Stockholders have agreed pursuant to the Joinders that any
amendment of this Agreement shall be binding on and enforceable against them,
whether or not they have signed this Agreement or such amendment. 9.4 Waivers.
No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid and binding unless
it is in writing and signed by the Party against whom the waiver is to be
effective. No failure on the part of any Party in exercising any right,
privilege or remedy hereunder and no delay on the part of any Party in
executing any right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right hereunder. No notice to or demand on a Party made hereunder shall
operate as a waiver of any right of the Party giving such notice or making
such demand to take further action without notice or demand as permitted
hereunder. 9.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including the Annexes,
Schedules and Exhibits hereto and the other documents referred to herein which
form a part hereof, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Joinders, contain
the entire understanding of the Parties with respect to the subject matter
contained herein and therein. This Agreement supersedes all prior and
contemporaneous, agreements, arrangements, contracts, discussions,
negotiations, undertakings and understandings (whether written or oral)
between the Parties with respect to such subject matter (other than the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Joinders). 9.6 No Third-Party Beneficiaries.
Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any Person (other than the Parties) any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under this Agreement, except that after the Effective Time,
Parent Indemnified Persons and Stockholder Indemnified 50  

  

 ![](exhibit21052.jpg) 

Persons shall be third party beneficiaries for purposes of enforcing the
rights granted to such Parent Indemnified Persons and Stockholder Indemnified
Persons under Section 8.2. For the avoidance of doubt, no consent of any
Indemnified Person shall be necessary to amend any provision of this
Agreement. 9.7 Remedies Cumulative. All rights and remedies of each of the
Parties shall be cumulative and the exercise of any one or more rights or
remedies shall not preclude the exercise of any other right or remedy
available hereunder or under applicable Law. 9.8 Specific Performance. The
Parties agree that Parent and Merger Sub would be irreparably harmed if any of
the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms and that any breach of this Agreement by the Company could not
be compensated adequately by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, the Parties
agree that, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled to
at Law or in equity, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to seek
temporary, preliminary and/or permanent injunctive relief or injunctions to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including the right
of Parent to compel the other Parties to cause the Merger to be consummated on
the terms and subject to conditions set forth in this Agreement) without
having to prove irreparable harm or that monetary damages would be inadequate.
The Company expressly waives any requirement under any Law that Parent or
Merger Sub obtain any bond or give any other undertaking in connection with
any action seeking injunctive relief or specific performance of any of the
provisions of this Agreement. The Company further agrees that in the event of
any action for specific performance relating to this Agreement or the Merger,
it shall not assert and hereby waives the defense that a remedy at Law would
be adequate or that specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason in Law or equity. 9.9 Severability. If a court of competent
jurisdiction finds that any term of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable under any Law or public policy, the other terms of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect if the economic and legal
substance of this Agreement and the Merger shall not be affected in any manner
materially adverse to any Party. Any such term found to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable only in part or in degree shall remain in full force and effect
to the extent not invalid, illegal or unenforceable. Upon the determination
that any term is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the Parties intend that
such term shall be construed by modifying or limiting it so as to be valid and
enforceable to the maximum extent possible under applicable Law and compatible
with the consummation of the Transactions as originally intended. 9.10 Costs
and Expenses. Except as otherwise specified herein, whether or not the Merger
is consummated, each Party shall pay all costs and expenses it has incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger. 9.11 Counterparts. This
Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when taken
together, shall constitute one instrument. The exchange by email of a PDF of a
handwritten original signature or signatures to the other Parties shall
constitute effective execution and delivery of this Agreement and may be used
in lieu of the original signature for all purposes. 9.12 Governing Law. This
Agreement and all claims or causes of action (whether sounding in contract or
tort) arising under or related to this Agreement, shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to any rule or principle that might refer the governance or
construction of this Agreement to the Laws of another jurisdiction. 9.13
Exclusive Jurisdiction; Venue; Service of Process. In any action or proceeding
between any of the Parties arising under or related to this Agreement, the
other Transaction Agreements or the Merger, each of the Parties (a) knowingly,
voluntarily, irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or to the extent that such court does not accept jurisdiction, the
Superior Court of the State of Delaware or the United States District Court
for the District of Delaware, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of any
such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined exclusively in
accordance with clause (a) of this Section 9.13, (c) waives any objection to
the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in such courts, including
any objection that any such action or proceeding has been brought in an
inconvenient forum or that the court does not have jurisdiction over any Party
and (d) agrees that service of process upon such Party in any such action or
proceeding shall be effective if such process is given as a notice in
accordance with Section 9.1. The Parties agree that any Party may commence 51  

  

 ![](exhibit21053.jpg) 

a proceeding in a court other than the above-named courts solely for the
purpose of enforcing an order or judgment issued by one of the above-named
courts. 9.14 JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY,
IRREVOCABLY AND UNDER THE PROFESSIONAL ADVICE OF COUNSEL WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING BETWEEN OR AMONG ANY OF
THE PARTIES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS OR THE MERGER. * * * [signature
