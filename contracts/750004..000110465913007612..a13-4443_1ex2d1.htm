(a) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Certain Other Company Securities_.
Each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or

(which are addressed in _Section 3.3_) and, except as provided in _Section
3.5_, the Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive

purposes of this Agreement, " **Total Common Merger Consideration** " shall
mean the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding (other than shares canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_, the
Company Restricted Shares (which are addressed in _Section 3.3_) and, except

respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement or
to prevent Parent or Merger Sub from exercising any remedies that may be
available to them as a result of any such change.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company, the identity
and the terms of appointment of which shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the " **Paying Agent** "), it being agreed by the parties that
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC is acceptable, for the payment of
the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(b)_. Substantially
concurrently with the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary
of State, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than holders of shares to be
canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_, the Company Restricted Shares (which
are addressed in _Section 3.3_) and, except as provided in _Section 3.5_,
the Dissenting Shares) cash constituting an amount equal to the Total Common
Merger Consideration (such Total Common Merger Consideration as deposited with
the Paying Agent, the " **Exchange Fund** "). In the event the Exchange Fund
shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section 3.1(b)_,
Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with
the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i)
held for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock that were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)_ and (ii) applied promptly to making the payments pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other
than to fund payments pursuant to _Section 3.1_.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the second (2nd) Business Day thereafter, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for
collection by hand) to each holder of record of a Certificate that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and
which shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent and the
Company may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration, the
form and substance of which letter of transmittal and instruction shall be
substantially as reasonably agreed by the Company and Parent and prepared
prior to Merger Closing.

 



 

(c) _Surrender Procedures_.

 



 

(i) _Certificates_. Upon the later of the Effective Time and surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the

 



      
 

 



 

Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor and Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay in exchange therefor as promptly as practicable,
the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_,
and the Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment of the appropriate amount of Merger
Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer (and accompanied
by all documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent) and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay, or cause to be paid, any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Except with respect to Dissenting
Shares, until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration into
which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate have been converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_. No interest
shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

 



 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent
to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this _Article III_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one
or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall automatically upon
the Effective Time (or, at any later time at which such Book-Entry Shares
shall be so converted) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, in respect of each such Book-Entry Share, the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains unclaimed by the applicable former stockholders of the Company one
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and
any such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with
this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation for payment of their claims for Merger Consideration in respect
thereof.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash held in the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which any
Merger Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, and any holder of such
Certificate who has not theretofore

 



      
 

 



 

complied with this _Article III_ with respect thereto shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration in respect thereof (if any).

 



 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation; provided that (i) no such investment shall
relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this
_Article III_, and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company
Common Stock in the amount of such losses, (ii) no such investment shall have
maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement, and (iii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of
the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days
or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States of America. Any interest or income produced by
such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
directed by Parent.

unvested), shall be canceled without any action on the part of any holder of
such Company Option in consideration for the right at the Effective Time to
receive in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect
thereto, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time,
the Option Cash Payment. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date
of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take the actions necessary to effectuate this _Section 3.3(a)(i)_. For
purposes of this Agreement, " **Option Cash Payment** " means, with respect to
any Company Option, a cash payment equal to the product of (A) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option and (B) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price payable
per share of Company Common Stock issuable under such Company Option, without
interest and less any required withholding Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt,
if the exercise price per share of any Company Option, whether vested or
unvested as of the Effective Time, is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, then by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and
without any action on the part of the Parent, the Company or the holder
thereof, the Company Option will be canceled without payment of any
consideration to the holder.

 



 

(ii) _Company Performance Units_. As of the Effective Time, each equity-based
unit granted prior to the date hereof (or promised to be granted pursuant to
Contracts or offer letters entered into prior to the date hereof by which the

performance-

 



      
 

 



 

based conditions (each a " **Performance Unit** ") and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled without any action on the part
of any holder of any Performance Unit in consideration for the right at the
Effective Time to receive in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder
with respect thereto, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time, the Performance Unit Payment. The " **Performance Unit
Payment** " means, with respect to any Performance Unit, a cash payment equal
to the holders Payout Percentage (which shall be deemed to be the greater of
(a) one hundred percent (100%) and (b) if all of the Performance Goals (as
defined in the relevant award agreement for such Performance Units) have been
met or exceeded as of the Effective Time, the greater of (i) the Payout
Percentage that such holder would have received if the Payout Percentage
determination had been made at the Effective Time or (ii) the Payout
Percentage determined on the Performance Measurement Date (as defined in the
relevant award agreement for such Performance Units) multiplied by the Merger
Consideration, without interest and less any required withholding Taxes. In no
event will the Company exercise any discretion pursuant to Section 6(c) of the
form award agreement for each such Performance Unit in its determination of
the Payout Percentage, which shall be objectively determined in accordance
with this _Section 3.3(a)(ii)_.

 



 

(iii) _Company Restricted Shares; Company Restricted Share Units; Company
Phantom Units_. Except as provided in _Section 6.1(e)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, each Company Restricted Share, Company Restricted Share
Unit and Company Phantom Unit granted prior to the date hereof (or promised to
be granted pursuant to Contracts or offer letters entered into prior to the
date hereof by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is party or bound)
that is outstanding, whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled in full
and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive in consideration for such
cancellation and in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with
respect thereto, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective
Time, a cash payment equal to the Merger Consideration, without interest and
less any required withholding Taxes (the " **Restricted Award Payment** ").

 



 

(iv) _Manner of Making Payment_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Surviving Corporation
sufficient cash funds to make all Option Cash Payments, all Restricted Award
Payments and all Performance Unit Payments, in each case, subject to and as
required pursuant to this _Section 3.3(a)_ and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to make such payments to all holders of Company Options, Company
Restricted Share Units, Company Restricted Shares, Company Phantom Units and
Performance Units, as applicable, as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time, and in any event, within five (5) Business Days thereafter or,
if later, on the earlier of any special payroll date elected by the Surviving
Corporation and the first payroll date of the Surviving Corporation that
occurs after the Merger Closing Date.

 



 

(v) With respect to Company Options, Performance Units, Company Restricted
Shares, Company Restricted Share Units and Company Phantom Units granted, in
each case, from and after the date of this Agreement in accordance with

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 6.1(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, at the Effective Time,
the Merger shall have the effects set forth in _Section 6.1(e)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Company Warrants_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Surviving Corporation

required, to all holders of Company Warrants in accordance with the terms of
such Company Warrants. For purposes of this Agreement, " **Warrant Payment** "
means, with respect to the Company Warrants issued in connection with the 2003
Warrants and the 2009 Warrants (as described in the Company SEC Documents
filed prior to the date hereof) and outstanding as of the Effective Time, a
payment in an amount in accordance with their terms.

 



 

(c) _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall take all necessary and appropriate actions such that (i) the
offering period in effect on the date hereof under the ESPP ends no later than
the tenth (10th) day preceding the Effective Time (the " **Final Purchase
Date** "), (ii) no new purchase or offering period under the ESPP commences on
or following the date hereof, (iii) participation in the offering period in
effect on the date hereof shall be limited to those eligible employees who are
participants on the date of this Agreement (and the Company shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable, ensure that such participants may not increase their
payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect immediately
prior to the date of this Agreement), and (iv) as of the Effective Time, as
applicable, the ESPP terminates in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. The
Company shall (if necessary) notify each participant in writing, at least ten
(10) days prior to the Final Purchase Date, that the then-current purchase
date for the participants option under the ESPP has been changed to the Final
Purchase Date and that the participants option shall be exercised
automatically on the Final Purchase Date, unless prior to such date the
participant withdraws from the then-current offering period. On the Final
Purchase Date, the Company shall apply all funds credited as of such date
under such ESPP within each participants payroll withholding account to the

issued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof (or
Contracts or offer letters entered into prior to the date hereof by which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is party or bound) that may entitle any
Person to own any capital stock of or other equity interests in Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries prior of the date hereof or to
receive any payment or other consideration in respect of the foregoing shall
be canceled immediately prior to the Effective Time without any payment
therefor (except for the cash payments expressly contemplated by this _Section
3.3_); it being understood that the intention of the parties is that
immediately following the Effective Time no holder of any Company Option,
Company Phantom Unit, Company Restricted Share Unit, Company Restricted Share,
Performance Unit or any participant in any Company Plan, other than the 2012
Incentive Plan, or other employee

 



      
 

 



 

benefit arrangement of the Company shall have any right thereunder to acquire
any capital stock (including any "phantom" stock, stock appreciation rights or
other equity interest) of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to such Company Plan, other
arrangement or otherwise, other than any rights to acquire capital stock of
Parent following the Effective Time under the 2012 Incentive Plan in respect
of awards granted after the date hereof in accordance with _Section 6.1(e)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,

and reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, and
who has properly exercised and perfected his or her demand for appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the " **Dissenting Shares** "), shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 3.1(b)_, but instead the holders of such Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have otherwise waived, effectively withdrawn or lost his or
her right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid
the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares under Section 262 of the
DGCL shall cease and such shares shall no longer be considered Dissenting
Shares for purposes hereof and such holders shares of Company Common Stock
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon,
as provided in _Section 3.1(b)_. The Company shall provide prompt written
notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any Company Common Stock,
attempted withdrawals of such notices or demands and any other instruments
received by the Company relating to rights to appraisal, and Parent shall have
the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, settle or offer to
settle any such demands. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made
available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 3.2(a)_ to pay for
Dissenting Shares shall be returned by the Paying Agent to Parent, upon
demand; _provided_ , that Parent shall remain liable to pay, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay, the Merger Consideration with respect to any
shares of Company Common Stock covered by the third sentence of this _Section
3.5_.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.6 _Withholdings_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration,
the Option Cash Payment, the Performance Unit Payment, the Restricted Award
Payment and the Warrant Payment, as applicable, and any amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock,
Company Options, Company Restricted Shares, Performance Units, Company
Restricted Share Units, Company Phantom Units or Company Warrants, such
amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. At the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer following the Effective Time,

(ii) disclosed in the corresponding section of the Company Disclosure Letter
(it being understood that any information set forth in one section or

each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
or to be in good standing would not constitute, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The copies of the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the " **Charter** ") and
Amended and Restated By-laws of the Company (the " **By-laws** "), in each

the extent

 



      
 

 



 

applicable) in good standing, under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct
its business as it is now being conducted. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is
duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and (to
the extent applicable) is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in which the
character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing would not
constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. True and correct copies of the organizational or governing documents
of Parent and Merger Sub (the " **Parent Organizational Documents** ") have
previously been provided to the Company.

execution and delivery of this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger and the Debt Financing (other than,
with respect to the consummation of the Merger, the filing of the Certificate
of Merger with the Secretary of State). This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, this Agreement
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub,
enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms (except
as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent

breach of, or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of
time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a Lien (other than, in the case of the Debt Financing, any Lien
required or permitted thereunder) on any of the properties or assets of Parent
or Merger Sub pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture or credit
agreement, or any other Contract or other instrument or obligation to which
Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which Parent or Merger Sub or any
property or asset of Parent or Merger Sub is bound, other than, in the case of

 



      
 

 



 

clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such violation, breach, default, right,
termination, amendment, acceleration, or cancellation that would not
constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(b) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger
Sub, the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the Debt Financing,
or performance of their obligations hereunder will require any consent,

Companys representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.5_ and
solely to the Knowledge of Parent as of the date hereof, are set forth on
_Section 5.3(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, (v) any filings required
under the rules of Nasdaq, and (vi) such other consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits, filings or notifications, the failure of which to
have, make or obtain, as applicable, would not constitute, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Absence of Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there
is no Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing
against either Parent or Merger Sub as would constitute, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Absence of Certain Agreements_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates has entered into any Contract, or authorized, committed or agreed
to enter into any Contract, pursuant to which: (a) any stockholder of the
Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or
nature than the Merger Consideration, (b) any stockholder of the Company (i)
agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or the Merger or (ii) agrees to vote

incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is
first provided to the Company, in each case, if applicable, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. No representation or
warranty is

 



      
 

 



 

made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated
by reference in the Proxy Statement based on information supplied by the
Company or any of its Representatives for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Financing_. (a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct
and complete copies of the fully executed debt commitment letter and Fee
Letter from Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith,
Incorporated, Credit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, UBS AG,
Stamford Branch and UBS Securities LLC (collectively, the " **Lenders** "),
dated as of the date hereof (including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and
amendments thereto as of the date of this Agreement and together with the
related Fee Letter, collectively, the " **Debt Commitment Letters** "),
pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the
Lenders have committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to Financing Sub
for the purpose of refinancing Parents existing senior secured credit
facility and funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
**Debt Financing** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that solely in the case of the
Fee Letter, accurate and complete copies have been delivered to the Company
with only the fee amounts and other economic provisions redacted.

 



 

(b) All of the Debt Commitment Letters, in the forms provided to the Company
by Parent (except to the extent amended or replaced in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement), and any definitive agreements with respect to the
Debt Financing (which definitive agreements, whether entered into before or
after the date of this Agreement (but if entered into after the date hereof,
only to the extent entered into in compliance with the first sentence of
_Section 6.11(d)_ or _Section 6.11(b)(i)_), are referred to collectively in
this Agreement as the " **Financing Agreements** ") are, or in the case of
Financing Agreements entered into after the date of this Agreement will be, in
full force and effect and are, or in the case of Financing Agreements entered
into after the date of this Agreement will be, legal, valid and binding
obligations of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties
thereto, enforceable against Parent (and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the
other parties thereto) in accordance with their respective terms (except as
such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights, and to general
equitable principles). As of the date of this Agreement, no Debt Commitment
Letter or Financing Agreement has been withdrawn, terminated, repudiated,
rescinded, amended, supplemented or modified, in any respect, and no such
withdrawal, termination, repudiation, rescission, amendment, supplement or
modification is contemplated. Parent has delivered to the Company an accurate
and complete copy of each Financing Agreement, if any, entered into on or
prior to the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, (i) neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor,
to the Knowledge of Parent, any other counterparty thereto is in breach of any
of its covenants or other obligations set forth in, or is in default under,
any of the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements, and (ii) to
Parents Knowledge, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Sections 7.2(a)_ , _7.2(b)_ and _7.2(c)_ , no event has occurred or
circumstance exists that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
or would reasonably be expected to (A) constitute or result in a breach or
default on the part of any Person under any of the Debt Commitment Letters or
Financing Agreements, (B) constitute or result in a failure to satisfy a
condition precedent or other contingency set forth in any of the Debt
Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements, (C) make any of the assumptions or
any of the

 



      
 

 



 

statements set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters inaccurate in any material
respect or (D) otherwise result in any portion of the Debt Financing not being
available. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has
received any notice or other communication from any party to any of the Debt
Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements with respect to (i) any actual or
potential breach or default on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or any other
party to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements, or (ii)
any intention of such party to terminate any of the Debt Commitment Letters or
Financing Agreements or to not provide all or any portion of the Debt
Financing. Parent and Merger Sub (both before and after giving effect to any
"market flex" provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and
Financing Agreements): (x) have no reason to believe that, assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.2(a)_ , _7.2(b)_ and
_7.2(c)_ , they will not be able to satisfy on a timely basis each term and
condition relating to the closing or funding of the Debt Financing; and (y)
know of no fact, occurrence, circumstance or condition that, assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.2(a)_ , _7.2(b)_ and
_7.2(c)_ ,would reasonably be expected to (1) cause any of the Debt Commitment
Letters or Financing Agreements to terminate, to be withdrawn, modified,
repudiated or rescinded or to be or become ineffective, or (2) otherwise cause
the full amount (or any portion) of the funds contemplated to be available
under the Debt Commitment Letters to not be available to Parent and Merger Sub
on a timely basis (and in any event as of the Merger Closing). Parent and/or
Merger Sub have fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees or
deposits required by the Debt Commitment Letters to be paid on or before the
date of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.2(a)_
, _7.2(b)_ and _7.2(c)_ , the aggregate proceeds from the Debt Financing
constitute all of the financing required for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and are sufficient in amount to
provide Parent and Merger Sub with the funds necessary for Parent and Merger
Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to satisfy their
respective obligations under this Agreement, including for Parent and Merger
Sub to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, the aggregate Option Cash
Payments, the aggregate Restricted Award Payments, the aggregate Performance
Unit Payments, the aggregate Warrant Payment, if any, and the aggregate amount
of any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by this Agreement or the
Debt Commitment Letters (including as contemplated by _Section 6.16_) and the
payment of all fees, costs and expenses to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub or
the Surviving Corporation related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including such fees and expenses relating to the Debt Financing
(such amounts, collectively, the " **Required Payment Amount** ").

 



 

(e) There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies to the obligation
of any party to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements to
fund the full amount (or any portion) of the Debt Financing, or that would
reasonably be expected to reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing,
including any condition or other contingency relating to the availability of
any "market flex" provisions, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof (the " **Disclosed
Conditions** "). Other than the Disclosed Conditions, no Financing Source or
other Person has any right to impose, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any Subsidiary obligor have any obligation to accept, any condition
precedent to any funding of the Debt Financing nor any reduction to the
aggregate amount available under the Debt Commitment Letters (nor any

 



      
 

 



 

term or condition which would have the effect of reducing the aggregate amount
available under the Debt Commitment Letters). There are no side letters and
(except for the Debt Commitment Letters and the Financing Agreements) there
are no agreements, contracts, arrangements or understandings, whether written
or oral, with any Lender, Financing Source or other Person relating to the
Debt Financing or the Debt Commitment Letters that could affect the
availability of the Debt Financing.

 



 

(f) Except with respect to the Persons set forth in _Section 5.7(f)_ of the
Parent Disclosure Letter, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives has entered into any contract,
agreement or understanding (i) that conditioned the awarding to any agent,
broker, investment banker or financial advisor of any financial advisory role
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby on such person
agreeing to advise any of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives on an exclusive basis in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or any Acquisition
Proposal or (ii) prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank or investment
bank or other potential provider of debt financing from providing or seeking
to provide debt financing or financial advisory services to any Person in
connection with a transaction relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries or
in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or
any Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company
agrees that a breach of the representation and warranties set forth in this
_Section 5.7_ shall not result in the failure of a condition precedent to the
Companys obligations under this Agreement, if (notwithstanding such breach)
Parent and Merger Sub are willing and able to (and actually do) consummate the
Merger on the Merger Closing Date in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. As of the date of this Agreement,
the authorized share capital of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, 100 of which are validly issued and
outstanding, and 100 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share,
none of which are issued or outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding
share capital of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by
Parent. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated hereby, and it has not conducted any business prior
to the date hereof and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have no,
assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to
its formation and pursuant to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Debt Financing).

 



 

Section 5.9 _Gaming Approvals and Licensing Matters_. None of Parent, Merger
Sub or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any of their respective officers,
directors or Affiliates, any existing beneficial owner of five percent (5%) or
more of the voting stock of Parent, or any lender under the Debt Commitment
Letters, in each case who or which will be required to be licensed or found
suitable under applicable Gaming Laws in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, has
ever been denied a gaming license, approval, or related finding of suitability
by any Gaming Authority, or had any gaming license or approval revoked or
suspended. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of Parent, there are no
facts or circumstances with respect to Parent, Merger

 



       
 

 



 

Sub or any of their respective Affiliates insofar as such Affiliate-owned
interest would be attributable to Parent or Merger Sub under any applicable
Gaming Law, that would prevent or materially delay receipt of any Gaming
Approvals.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Solvency_. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in _Sections 7.2(a)_ , _7.2(b)_ and _7.2(c)_ , each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will, after giving effect to all of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Debt Financing, any Alternative
Financing and the payment of the Required Payment Amount, be Solvent at and
immediately after the Effective Time. For the purposes of this Agreement, the
term " **Solvent** " means that, as of any date of determination and with
respect to any Person: (a) the sum of the debt (including contingent
liabilities) of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, does not
exceed the present fair saleable value of the present assets of such Person
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (b) the capital of such Person and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, is not unreasonably small in relation to the
business of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and (c) such
Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, do not have debts including
current obligations beyond their ability to pay or refinance such debts as
they mature in the ordinary course of business; _provided_ , _however_ , for
the purposes hereof, the amount of any contingent liability at any time shall
be computed as the amount that, in light of all of the facts and circumstances
existing at such time, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected
to become an actual or matured liability (irrespective of whether such
contingent liabilities meet the criteria for accrual under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 5).

 



 

Section 5.11 _DGCL Section 203; Ownership of Company Securities_. Neither
Parent nor Merger Sub is, nor at any time during the last three (3) years has
either Parent or Merger Sub been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company
as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. Parent and its Subsidiaries do not
beneficially own (as such term is used in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) any shares of Company Common Stock or other securities of the
Company or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire Company Common
Stock or other securities of the Company.

employees, (b) offered employment to any of the Companys directors, officers
or employees, (c) had negotiations with any of the Companys directors,
officers or employees regarding employment after the Merger Closing or (d)
sold, or offered to sell, any direct or indirect equity interest in the
Company to any of the Companys directors, officers or employees.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Brokers_. Other than Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, whose fees and expenses
shall be borne solely by Parent, no broker, finder or investment banker is
entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection
with the Merger and any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger
Sub.

 



 

Section 5.14 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Article V, none of
Parent, Merger Sub

 



      
 

 



 

or any of their respective Affiliates nor any other Person on behalf of any of
them makes any express or implied representation or warranty (and there is and
has been no reliance by the Company or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives on any such representation or warranty) with respect to
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective businesses or with respect to any other
information provided, or made available, to the Company or any of its
Representatives or Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated

Section 6.2 _Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting_.

 



 

(a) _Preparation and Filing of Proxy Statement_. As promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in any event no later
than twenty-five (25) calendar days after the date of this Agreement), the
Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC in preliminary form a
proxy statement relating to the Stockholders Meeting (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the " **Proxy Statement** "). Except as
expressly contemplated by _Section 6.5(c)_ or _Section 6.5(d)_, the Proxy
Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation with respect to the
Merger. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) or any request from the SEC
(or the staff of the SEC) for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement, and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between
the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC), on the other hand. Each of the parties hereto shall use
their reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable
to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect to the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts so that the Proxy
Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions
of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC)
with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response
(which comments shall be provided promptly and be reasonably considered).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Covenants of Parent with Respect to the Proxy Statement_. Parent shall
furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub as may
be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the Proxy Statement,
including such information that is required by the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement,
and shall otherwise assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation
of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of comments from the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC). Parent will, upon request of the Company, confirm and/or
supplement the information relating to Parent or Merger Sub supplied by it for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement, such that at the time of the mailing of the
Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of
the Stockholders Meeting, such information shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(c) _Mailing of Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting_. The Company shall,
as promptly as practicable (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days
following the Proxy Statement Clearance Date), (x) establish a record date for
and give notice of a meeting of its stockholders, for the purpose of voting
upon the adoption of this Agreement (including any adjournment or postponement
thereof, the " **Stockholders  Meeting**") and (y) mail to the holders of
Company Common Stock as of the record date established for the Stockholders
Meeting a Proxy Statement (such date, the " **Proxy Date** "). The Company
shall duly call, convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Proxy Date; provided, however, that the
Company may postpone, recess or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting: (i) with
the consent of Parent, (ii) for the absence of a quorum or (iii) to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and distribution of any supplemental
or amended disclosure which the Company Board has determined in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is necessary under
applicable Laws and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated to and reviewed by the Companys stockholders prior to the
Stockholders Meeting. Once the Company has established a record date for the
Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Stockholders Meeting without the
prior written consent of Parent, unless required to do so by applicable Law or
the By-laws. Unless the Company Board shall have effected a Change in
Recommendation, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit
proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and shall ensure that all
proxies solicited in connection with the Stockholders Meeting are solicited
in compliance with all applicable Laws and all rules of the NYSE.

 



 

(d) _Amendments to Proxy Statement_. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time any event or circumstance relating to the Company or Parent or any of the
Companys or Parents Subsidiaries, or their respective officers or directors,
is discovered by the Company or Parent, respectively, which, pursuant to the
Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy
Statement, such party shall promptly inform the others. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company agrees to correct any information provided by it for use
in the Proxy Statement which shall have become false or misleading.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.3 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto shall (and shall cause each of their applicable
Affiliates and Subsidiaries to) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and use its reasonable best efforts to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate, as promptly as
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties agree to use
its respective reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the conditions to the
Merger set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied as promptly as practicable,
(ii) obtain all necessary consents, approvals, orders, waivers, finding of
suitability and authorizations of, actions or nonactions by, any Governmental
Authority (including Gaming Authorities) or any third party necessary in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger and make all necessary registrations,
declarations and filings with, and notices to, any Governmental Authorities
(including pursuant to the HSR Act any other applicable Antitrust Law
necessary to start any applicable waiting period and including under Gaming
Laws) and take all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval
from, or to avoid a suit, action, proceeding or investigation by, any
Governmental Authority or other Persons necessary in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger; _provided_ , that, in no event shall the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries be required to pay, prior to the Effective Time, any fee, penalty
or other consideration to obtain any consent, approval, order, waiver or
authorization in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, under any Contract other than _de minimis_
amounts or amounts that are advanced or reimbursed substantially simultaneous
by Parent and (iii) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary
to consummate the Merger and any other transactions to be performed or
consummated by such party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
to carry out fully the purposes of this Agreement. In no event shall the
Company (A) be required to agree to take or enter into any action which is not
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger or (B) agree to any obligation
or concession or other action relating to the Antitrust Approvals or the
Required Gaming Approvals without the prior written consent of Parent;
_provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed
that any failure by the Company to agree to any such obligation or concession
by reason of Parents withholding its written consent from the Company to do
so shall not constitute a breach by the Company of this _Section 6.3_.
Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to make (or cause its
applicable Affiliates or Subsidiaries to make) any such concessions or
undertakings (x) unless such concessions or undertakings are conditioned on
the consummation of the Merger, and (y) to the extent that, in the sole
judgment of Parent, such concessions or undertakings would reasonably be
expected to require Parent and its Affiliates (including, following the
Merger, the Company and its Subsidiaries) to, directly or indirectly, incur
costs, expenses, liabilities or losses of any kind, suffer any diminution of
value, lose or forfeit any revenues, profits or expected benefits of the
Merger, or diminish the combined value of Parent, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries following the Merger, in an aggregate amount in excess
of $80,000,000.

 



 

(b) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees (i) promptly after the
date hereof, but in any event within ten (10) Business Days following the date
hereof, to file all Notification and Report Forms required under the HSR Act
with respect to the

 



      
 

 



 

transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) to file all other notifications
required under any other Antitrust Law or any Gaming Law with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger,
(including all required initial applications and documents in respect of
officers and directors and Affiliates in connection with obtaining the Gaming
Approvals (and where appropriate indications of further information to come by
supplementary filing)) as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event
within forty (40) days following the date hereof with respect to the Gaming
Approvals set forth on _Section 7.1(c)(I)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
and within sixty (60) days following the date hereof with respect to any other
applicable approvals), (iii) to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable
any additional information and documentary material in its possession that may
be requested pursuant to the HSR Act, any other Antitrust Law or any Gaming
Law, and (iv) to use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken
all actions necessary, proper or advisable consistent with, and subject to,
the other provisions of this _Section 6.3_, to (A) cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Law as promptly as reasonably practicable, including, if possible
under applicable Law, by requesting early termination thereof, and (B) obtain
all Gaming Approvals required to permit the parties hereto to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or necessary to permit Parent to
acquire, own and operate the Company. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, in connection with the
efforts referred to in _Section 6.3(a)_ to obtain all requisite approvals and
authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the
HSR Act, any other Antitrust Law or any Gaming Law, use reasonable best
efforts to (A) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with
any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (B) keep the
other party reasonably informed of any communication received by such party
from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Authority and of any
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby
(other than to the extent relating to private or personal information
pertaining to any individual which may remain confidential); and (C)
reasonably permit the other party to review any material communication given
by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference,
where reasonably practicable to do so, with, any Governmental Authority or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and
to the extent permitted by such applicable Governmental Authority or other
Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and conferences (telephonic or in person), where reasonably
practicable to do so; _provided_ , that, Parent, after prior, good faith
consultation with the Company and after considering, in good faith, the
Companys views and comments, shall have the principal responsibility for
devising and implementing the strategy for obtaining any of the Antitrust
Approvals or Required Gaming Approvals and shall take the lead in all meetings
and communications with, or Proceeding involving, any Governmental Authority
in connection with obtaining the Antitrust Approvals and the Required Gaming
Approvals; _provided_ , _however_ , that the consent of each party shall be
required prior to the taking of any action (including the failure to take any
such action) in connection with obtaining any Antitrust Approvals or Required
Gaming Approvals if such action (or failure to act) would be reasonably likely
to materially delay, or materially impair the likelihood of obtaining, any
such approvals.

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in _Section 6.3(a)_ and _Section 6.3(b)_, subject to the last
sentence of _Section 6.3(a)_, if

 



      
 

 



 

any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby under any Antitrust Law or Gaming Law or if any Proceeding, whether
judicial or administrative, is instituted (or threatened in writing to be
instituted) by any Governmental Authority or any other private party
challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any
Antitrust Law or Gaming Law or which would otherwise prevent or materially
impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent and the
Company shall, subject to the other provisions of this _Section 6.3_
(including the last sentence of _Section 6.3(a)_), use reasonable best
efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have
any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Authority vacated or reversed and taking, or agreeing to take, a
Divestiture Action.

 



 

(d) The Company shall if requested in writing by Parent, promptly take any and
all actions necessary to withdraw its license from the Casino Committee of the
Ministry of Tourism in Greece (the " _Specified Greece Gaming Approvals_ ");
_provided_ that, (i) in any such written request, Parent has confirmed in an
irrevocable written notice delivered to the Company that all of the conditions
set forth in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ have been satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at
the Merger Closing, _provided_ that such conditions are reasonably capable of
being satisfied), (ii) the Merger Closing shall occur immediately following
the Companys delivery of any such withdrawal notice in respect of the
Specified Greece Gaming Approvals and (iii) nothing in this _Section 6.3(d)_
shall otherwise affect the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub hereunder.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. From the date of this
Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, the Company will, and
will cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to, provide
to Parent and its authorized Representatives (x) reasonable access during
normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice from Parent to their
respective personnel, facilities, properties, books, contracts and records as
Parent may reasonably request and (y) such financial and operating data of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and other information with respect to the
business, properties and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
Parent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall not be required to provide access to, or cause its Subsidiaries to
provide access to, or disclose (a) any information or documents which would
(in the reasonable judgment of the Company) be reasonably likely to (i)
constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege held by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) violate any applicable Laws, (iii)
unreasonably disrupt the businesses and operations of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or (iv) breach any agreement of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with any Third Party; provided, that each party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain any required consents and take such other
reasonable action (such as the entry into a joint defense agreement or other
arrangement to avoid loss of attorney client privilege) to permit such access
or disclosure; or (b) if the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse
parties in a litigation, any information that is reasonably pertinent thereto.
All information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall be subject to
the Confidentiality Agreement and the parties shall comply with, and shall
cause their respective Representatives (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) to comply with, all of their

 



      
 

 



 

respective obligations thereunder, except that Parent may make disclosures of
Confidential Information (as such term is defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) to Governmental Authorities to the extent necessary to obtain any
Gaming Approvals or Antitrust Approvals.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this
_Section 6.5_, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or,
if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
the Company will not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of providing non-public
information) the making of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal
or request for information that may reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal or (ii) other than informing Third Parties of the
existence of the provisions contained in this _Section 6.5_, engage in
negotiations or substantive discussions with, or furnish any nonpublic
information to, any Third Party relating to an Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry, proposal or request for information that may reasonably be expected
to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
may ascertain facts from the party making such Acquisition Proposal for the
sole purpose of the Company Board informing itself about the Acquisition
Proposal and the party making it. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, immediately request the prompt
return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished and
immediately terminate all physical and electronic dataroom access previously
granted to any such Person or its Representatives.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the date that the Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained
at the Stockholders Meeting, in the event that the Company receives a written
Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal was made after the date of
this Agreement and did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.5_), the
Company and the Company Board and their Representatives may, subject to
compliance with this _Section 6.5(b)_, engage in negotiations or substantive
discussions (including, as a part thereof, making counterproposals) with, or
furnish any information and other access to, any Third Party making such
Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives or potential sources of financing
if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal and financial advisors, and based on information then
available, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely
to result in, a Superior Proposal; provided, that the Company shall give
written notice to Parent after any such determination by the Company Board and
prior to taking any of the actions described in this _Section 6.5(b)_;
provided, further, that (x) prior to furnishing any material nonpublic
information or providing other access, the Company receives from such Third
Party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) any such
material nonpublic information so furnished or access so provided has been
previously provided or made available to Parent or is provided or made
available (including through posting on the Electronic Data Room) to Parent
substantially concurrently with it being so furnished to such Third Party.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.5_ by any Representative of the
Company or any of its Affiliates (including the Company Board or any

 



      
 

 



 

committee thereof) acting in such capacity shall constitute a breach of this
_Section 6.5_ by the Company.

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this _Section
6.5(c)_ or _Section 6.5(d)_, neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or qualify or modify in any manner adverse to
Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or so qualify or modify), the
Company Board Recommendation, (B) take any action to exempt any Person (other
than Parent and its Affiliates) from the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL
or any other state takeover statute, or (C) approve, adopt or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal, or propose publicly to approve, adopt or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred
to as a " **Change in Recommendation** ") or (ii) approve, adopt or recommend,
or propose publicly to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to execute any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
similar definitive agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) with any Third Party constituting or relating to any Acquisition
Proposal (an " **Alternative Acquisition Agreement** "). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to the
receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may make a
Change in Recommendation if the Company Board determines (after consultation
with its outside counsel and financial advisors) that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the
Company has provided Parent four (4) Business Days prior written notice
advising Parent that it intends to take such action and specifying, in
reasonable detail, the reasons for such action.

 



 

(d) Without limiting _Section 6.5(c)_, at any time prior to receipt of the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, in response to a written Acquisition Proposal
made after the date of this Agreement and not the result of a breach of this
_Section 6.5_ that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor) constitutes a
Superior Proposal, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ and this _Section 6.5(d)_ and, concurrently with such
termination, may enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ and this _Section
6.5(d)_ unless the Company pays, or causes to be paid, to Parent the Company
Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ prior to or
concurrently with such termination.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ and _Section 6.5(d)_, (x) unless the Company shall have provided
to Parent four (4) Business Days prior written notice (the " **6.5(e)
Notice**") advising Parent that the Company intends to take such action (and
(unless a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreement has been
provided to Parent) specifying, in reasonable detail, the material terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Third Party
making any such Superior Proposal) and, if applicable, a copy of the relevant
proposed transaction agreement, and (y):

 



       
 

 



 

(i) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent regarding
changes to the terms of this Agreement intended to cause such Acquisition
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 



 

(ii) the Company Board shall have considered any adjustments to this Agreement
(including a change to the price terms hereof) and the other agreements
contemplated hereby that may be offered in writing by Parent (the " **Proposed
Changed Terms** ") no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth
(4th) Business Day of such four (4) Business Day period and shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and
financial advisors) that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal if such Proposed Changed Terms were to be given effect.

 



 

(it being understood that any material revision or amendment to the terms of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new 6.5(e) Notice and, in such case,
all references to four (4) Business Days in this Section 6.5(e) shall be
deemed to be two (2) days.

 



 

(f) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48)
hours) advise Parent orally or in writing in the event that the Company
receives any Acquisition Proposal, and in connection with such notice, provide
to Parent the material terms and conditions (excluding the identity of the
Third Party making any such Acquisition Proposal) of any such Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and
material details (including any material change to the terms thereof) of any
such Acquisition Proposal and any discussions and negotiations concerning the
material terms and conditions thereof.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing any position or disclosing any
information reasonably required under applicable Law or in compliance with or
otherwise complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Companys stockholders), and
to the extent referred to therein, Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) making
any "stop, look and listen" communication to the Companys stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to the Companys stockholders), or (iii) making any disclosure
not of the type provided in clauses (i) or (ii) above to the Companys
stockholders that is reasonably required by applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company Board shall not make a Change in Recommendation
or make or authorize any disclosure which would reasonably be expected to have
the same effect as a Change in Recommendation, except in each case in
accordance with _Section 6.5(c)_.

 



 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " **Acquisition Proposal** " shall mean, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any bona fide proposal or offer (other than a
proposal or offer by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) from a Third Party
relating to (i) a

 



      
 

 



 

merger, reorganization, sale of assets, share exchange, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation, joint
venture or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries whose revenues, income, EBITDA or assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated
revenues, income, EBITDA or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in the
case of assets, based on fair market value, as determined in good faith by the
Company Board)); (ii) the acquisition (whether by merger, consolidation,
equity investment, joint venture or otherwise) by any Person of twenty-five
percent (25%) or more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole (based on fair market value, as determined in good faith by the
Company Board); (iii) the acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly,
by any Person of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock; (iv) any purchase, acquisition,
tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any
Person beneficially owning twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the Company
Common Stock or any class of equity or voting securities of the Company (or
any of its Subsidiaries whose revenues, income, EBITDA or assets, individually
or in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the
consolidated revenues, income, EBITDA or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (in the case of assets, based on fair market value)), or (v) any
combination of the foregoing.

 



 

(ii) " **Superior Proposal** " shall mean an Acquisition Proposal (the
references to "twenty-five percent (25%)" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)") made by a
Third Party on terms that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys financial advisors and outside counsel, and
considering such factors as the Company Board considers in good faith to be
appropriate (including the conditionality and the timing and likelihood of
consummation of such proposal), are more favorable to the holders of Company
Common Stock than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after
giving effect to all Proposed Changed Terms).

 



 

Section 6.6 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. (a)
Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and indemnification
(and all rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto) for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters
arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger), now existing in favor of the Indemnitees as provided in
the Charter or By-laws (or such equivalent organizational or governing
documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of
this Agreement) or in any Contract between such Indemnitee and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (in each case as in effect on the date hereof) shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. From and after
the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify, defend and hold harmless,
and advance expenses to, to the fullest extent the Company would have been
permitted to do so under applicable Law, Indemnitees with respect to (x) all
acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time at or prior
to the Effective Time or (y) any costs or expenses (including attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,

 



      
 

 



 

to the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out
of or pertains to the Merger, this Agreement and any transactions contemplated
hereby, in either case, to the fullest extent permitted by (i) the Charter or
By-laws (or such equivalent organizational or governing documents of any of
the Companys Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement), (ii)
any indemnification agreement of the Company or its Subsidiaries or other
applicable contract as in effect on the date of this Agreement, which
provisions thereafter shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
Indemnitees or (iii) applicable Law. Parent shall cause the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitation of director, officer
and employee liability that are no less favorable to the Indemnitees than
those set forth in the Charter and By-laws and the Companys Subsidiaries
organizational documents as of the date of this Agreement, which provisions
thereafter shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnitees.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.6(a)_, to the fullest
extent the Company would have been permitted to do so under applicable Law,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will pay in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the
expenses (including attorneys fees) of any Indemnitee upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amount even if it
shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 6.6(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or
otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this _Section
6.6(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of all Indemnitees from all liability arising out of
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and does not include an
admission of fault or wrongdoing by any Indemnitee.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, at the Companys option, the Company shall
or, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-
cancelable extension of the directors and officers liability coverage of the
Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies and the
Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the "
**D andO Insurance**"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period
of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to
any claim related to any period or time at or prior to the Effective Time from
an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as in effect as of
the date hereof. If such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by either the
Company or the Surviving Corporation prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full
term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation. If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fails
to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, (i) the
Surviving Corporation shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of

 



      
 

 



 

at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in
place as of the date hereof with the Companys current insurance carrier or
with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof, or (ii) Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time,
the Indemnitees who are insured under the Companys DandO Insurance with
comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage for events occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier, that is no less
favorable than the existing policy of the Company as of the date hereof or, if
substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available
coverage; provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of
two hundred and fifty percent (250%) of the annual premium currently paid by
the Company for such insurance; provided, further, that if the annual premiums
of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for
a cost not exceeding such amount. From and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and honor, guaranty and
stand surety for, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the
covenants contained in this _Section 6.6(c)_.

 



 

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.6_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.6_. The provisions of this _Section 6.6_
are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her
successors, heirs or representatives. To the fullest extent the Company would
have been permitted to do so under applicable Law, Parent shall pay all
reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnitee in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this
_Section 6.6_.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 6.6_ shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the Charter or By-laws (or
equivalent organizational or governing documents of any of the Companys
Subsidiaries), certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation, under any applicable Law or under any
agreement of any Indemnitee with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this _Section 6.6_
shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be
binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the
Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall ensure that proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.6_ and use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that a Person no
less financially viable than the

 



      
 

 



 

Surviving Corporation (in the event the Effective Time occurs) remains
responsible for the obligations of such party under this _Section 6.6_.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the
Company, upon receiving Knowledge of (a) any notice, complaint, investigation
or hearing (or communications indicating that the same may be contemplated)
from any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement, the Merger
or the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any written notice of any Person
(other than a Governmental Authority) alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened in writing
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of
its Subsidiaries which relate to this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (d) any material change, effect,
development or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to give rise to
a failure of a condition precedent in _Section 7.2_ (in the case of the
Company) and _Section 7.3_ (in the case of Parent); provided, however, that
no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements of the parties herein or the conditions to the obligations of
the parties hereunder and any failure to make such notification (in and of
itself) shall not be taken into account in determining whether the conditions
set forth in _Section 7.2_ (in the case of the Company) and _Section 7.3_
(in the case of Parent) have been satisfied or give rise to any right of
termination to any party hereto under _Article VIII_.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release(s) announcing
the execution of this Agreement shall be in a form mutually agreed upon by
Parent and the Company. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other
before issuing, and, to the extent practicable, give each other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on, any other press release or other public
announcements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
announcement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable Law, court process or the rules and regulations of any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, (i) the Company will no longer be
required to consult with Parent in connection with any such press release or
public announcement if the Company Board has effected any Change in
Recommendation or shall have resolved to do so and (ii) the requirements of
this _Section 6.8_ shall not apply to any disclosure by the Company or Parent
of any information concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in connection with any dispute between the parties regarding this
Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) _U.S. Continuing Employees_.

 



 

(i) During the one (1)-year period commencing at the Effective Time or such
shorter period as the applicable employee may be employed, Parent shall
provide or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to employees of
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries who are located in the United States
(" **US**

 



      
 

 



 

 **Company Employees** ") a base salary or wage rate and annual bonus at least
equal to the US Company Employees base salary or wage rate and annual bonus
in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and other compensation
(excluding equity, equity-based and other similar long-term incentive
opportunities) and benefits (including vacation policies, retirement benefits,
health, welfare and fringe benefits or similar arrangements) that are, in the
aggregate, no less favorable than the compensation and benefits being provided
to US Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(ii) Without limiting _Section 6.9(a)(i)_, during the one (1)-year period
commencing at the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide, to US Company Employees who experience a termination of employment
severance benefits that are no less than the severance benefits such employees
would be entitled to upon such a termination of employment under the severance
policies set forth on _Section 6.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(iii) For purposes of eligibility, vesting, and benefit accrual (solely for
the purposes of determining accrual of vacation and paid time off) under the
compensation and benefit plans, programs agreements and arrangements of
Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any respective Subsidiary
and Affiliate thereof providing benefits to any US Company Employees after the
Merger Closing (the " **New Plans** "), and determination of level of benefits
to the extent Parent credits prior service of its similarly situated
employees, each US Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company (including any predecessor), the Company Subsidiaries
and their respective Affiliates (and any additional service with any
predecessor employer) before the Merger Closing, to the same extent as such US
Company Employee was entitled, before the Merger Closing, to credit for such
service under any similar Company Benefit Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in no event shall US Company Employees be entitled to service credit to the
extent such service credit would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each US Company Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to
the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable
Company Benefit Plan in which such US Company Employee participated
immediately before the replacement; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any US
Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents to the extent such exclusions or
requirements were waived or satisfied under the comparable Company Benefit
Plan, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee
and his or her covered dependents under a Company Benefit Plan during the
portion of the plan year prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance,
co-payment and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee
and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or in any Company Benefit Plan, for purposes of
any Company Benefit Plan containing a definition of "change in control" or
"change of control," the Merger Closing shall be deemed to constitute a
"change in control" or "change of control."

 



 

(v) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.9_, the terms and conditions
of employment for any US Company Employees that are governed by a collective
bargaining agreement immediately prior to the Merger Closing shall continue to
be governed by such collective bargaining agreement as of the Merger Closing
until the expiration, termination or modification of such agreement in
accordance with its terms or applicable Law.

 



 

(b) _International Continuing Employees_. For the one (1)-year period
commencing at the Effective Time or such shorter period as the applicable
employee may be employed, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company located
outside of the United States with terms and conditions of employment,
including compensation (excluding equity, equity-based and other similar long-
term incentive opportunities) and benefit plans and arrangements (including
vacation policies, retirement benefits, health, welfare and fringe benefits
and any severance or similar arrangements) that are, in the aggregate, no less
favorable than those provided to such employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time, or such other terms and conditions of employment as may be
required by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) The Company shall provide Parent, with a copy of any material written
communications intended for broad-based and general distribution to any
current or former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries if such
communications relate to the transactions contemplated hereby and will provide
Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review such communications prior to
distribution.

 



 

(d) This _Section 6.9_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 6.9_,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 6.9_ or
is intended to be, shall constitute or be construed as an amendment to or
modification of the Company Benefit Plans or any other employee benefit plan
or arrangement of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates or
limit in any way the right of the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or any other
employee benefit plans or arrangements. Nothing in this _Section 6.9_ shall
limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any US Company Employee or any
international continuing employee at any time following the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Conduct of Business by Parent Pending the Merger_. Parent and
Merger Sub covenant and agree with the Company that between the date hereof
and the earlier of the Effective Time and the date, if any, on which this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, Parent shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take or agree to take

 



      
 

 



 

any action (including entering into agreements with respect to any
acquisitions, mergers, consolidations or business combinations) which would
reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Financing_. (a) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that
the Company and its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives
shall not have any responsibility for, or incur any liability to any Person
under, any financing that Parent and Merger Sub may raise in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any cooperation provided
pursuant to _Section 6.12_ and that Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint
and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates
and its and their respective Representatives from and against any and all
losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them
in connection with the Debt Financing and any information utilized in
connection therewith.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the
proceeds of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions, taken as a whole
(including the flex provisions) described in the Debt Commitment Letters,
including executing and delivering all such documents and instruments as may
be reasonably required thereunder and using (and causing their Affiliates to
use) their respective reasonable best efforts to:

 



 

(i) comply with and maintain in effect the Debt Financing and the Debt
Commitment Letters, negotiate and enter into Financing Agreements with respect
thereto (and maintain in effect and comply with the terms thereof) on the
terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (as such terms
may be modified or adjusted in accordance with the terms of any "flex"
provisions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters (including as specified in
any Fee Letter)) or on other terms no less favorable, taken as a whole, to
Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letters;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, without limiting the foregoing, in no event
shall any of the Financing Agreements: (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the
Debt Financing provided for in the Debt Commitment Letter (including by
changing the amount of fees or original issue discount contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letters) in a manner that would adversely impact in any
material respect the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger; (B) expand, amend or modify the conditions or other contingencies to
the receipt or funding of the Debt Financing beyond those expressly set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letters in a manner that would adversely impact in any
material respect the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to obtain the Debt
Financing (including by making any such conditions or other contingencies less
likely to be satisfied, it being agreed that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent and Merger Sub may modify, supplement or amend the Debt Commitment
Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the
date hereof on the same terms) or impose any new or additional condition or
other contingency to the receipt or funding of the Debt Financing in a manner
that would adversely impact in any material respect the ability of Parent and
Merger Sub to obtain the Debt Financing; (C) contain terms (other than those
terms expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters) that would
reasonably be expected

 



      
 

 



 

to (1) prevent or delay in any material respect the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or the date on which the Debt Financing would
be obtained, or (2) make the funding of the Debt Financing less likely to
occur; or (D) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce
its rights against the Financing Sources.

 



 

(ii) satisfy, or cause their Representatives to satisfy all conditions to the
Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters and Financing
Agreements relating thereto (including by paying any commitment, engagement,
or placement or other fees that become due and payable under or with respect
to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements);

 



 

(iii) accept (and comply with) to the fullest extent all "market flex"
provisions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters and the Financing
Agreements;

 



 

(iv) enforce its rights (including through litigation) under the Debt
Commitment Letters and Financing Agreements in the event of a breach (or
threatened breach) by the Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment Letters
and Financing Agreements relating thereto, including seeking specific
performance of the parties thereunder; and

 



 

(v) subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent thereto, cause the
Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing at or prior to the time the
Merger Closing is required to occur pursuant to the terms and conditions
hereof.

 



 

(c) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall agree to or permit any amendment,
supplement or other modification or replacement of, or grant any waiver of,
any condition, remedy or other provision under any Debt Commitment Letter or
any Financing Agreements without the prior written consent of the Company if
such amendment, supplement, modification, replacement or waiver would or would
reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount) from that contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters
delivered as of the date hereof in a manner that would adversely impact in any
material respect the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger, (ii) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or
modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, in each
case, in a manner that would adversely impact in any material respect the
ability of Parent and Merger Sub to obtain the Debt Financing, (iii) make it
less likely that the Debt Financing would be funded (including by making the
conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing less likely to occur (it being
agreed that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub may modify,
supplement or amend the Debt Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not
executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date hereof on the same terms))
or otherwise prevent or delay or impair in any material respect the ability or
likelihood of Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) adversely impact the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other
parties to the Debt Commitment Letters or (v) otherwise contravene the
limitations set forth in _Section 6.11(b)(i)(A)-(D)_. Other than in
connection with an Alternative Financing, neither Parent nor

 



       
 

 



 

Merger Sub shall agree to the withdrawal, repudiation, termination or
rescission of any Debt Commitment Letter or Financing Agreement or any
provision thereof without the prior written consent of the Company (it being
agreed that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub may modify,
supplement or amend the Debt Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not
executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date hereof on the same terms).
Upon any amendment, supplement or modification of the Debt Commitment Letter
in accordance with this _Section 6.11(c)_, Parent shall deliver a copy
thereof to the Company and references herein to "Debt Commitment Letters" and
"Debt Commitment Letters" shall include such documents as amended,
supplemented or modified in compliance with this _Section 6.11(c)_ and
references to "Debt Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letters as amended, supplemented or modified in compliance
with this _Section 6.11_ and the financing contemplated by the Financing
Agreements entered into in compliance with this _Section 6.11_, as
applicable.

 



 

(d) In the event that all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes or
would reasonably be expected to become unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including any "flex" provisions) or from the sources contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements for any reason or any of the
Debt Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements shall be withdrawn,
repudiated, terminated or rescinded for any reason, (i) Parent shall promptly
so notify the Company and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event (and in any event no later
than the Merger Closing Date), and to negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to, alternative financing from the same or alternative
sources (the " **Alternative Financing** "), on terms not less favorable, in
any material respect, with respect to conditionality and enforceability, when
taken as a whole, than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letters to
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or replace any unavailable
portion of the Debt Financing), and to obtain a new financing commitment
letter (including any associated engagement letter and related fee letter)
with respect to such Alternative Financing (collectively, the " **New Debt
Commitment Letter** "), copies of which shall be promptly provided to the
Company (with customary redactions with respect to the fee letter). In the
event any Alternative Financing is obtained and a New Commitment Letter is
entered into in accordance with this _Section 6.11(d)_ (i) any reference in
this Agreement to "Debt Financing" or the "Financing" shall mean the debt
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to
clause (ii) below, and (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt
Commitment Letters" (or defined terms that use such phrase) shall be deemed to
include the Debt Commitment Letter (and any related Fee Letter) to the extent
not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter (or related new Fee Letter), as
the case may be, at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letter
(and any related new Fee Letter) to the extent then in effect. Without the
Companys prior written consent, Parent shall not directly or indirectly take
any action that would or would be reasonably expected to result in the Debt
Financing not being available.

 



 

(e) Any breach of the Debt Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements by
Parent or Merger Sub shall be deemed a breach by Parent of this _Section
6.11_. Parent shall (i) furnish the Company drafts (when available) and
thereafter complete, correct and

 



      
 

 



 

executed copies of the Financing Agreements promptly upon their execution,
(ii) give the Company prompt written notice of any default, breach or
threatened breach by any party of any of the Debt Financing Commitments or
Financing Agreements of which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Representatives or Affiliates become aware or any termination or threatened
termination thereof, and (iii) otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed
of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing (or any Alternative
Financing). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall
give the Company prompt (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) notice
(A) of any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give
rise to any default or breach) related to the Debt Financing of which Parent
becomes aware, (B) of the receipt or delivery of any notice or other
communication, in each case from any Person with respect to (x) any actual or
potential breach of any provisions of the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing
Agreements by Parent or Merger Sub, or any default, termination or repudiation
by any party to any of Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements or
other agreements relating to the Debt Financing or (y) any dispute or
disagreement between or among parties to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or
Financing Agreements with respect to the obligation to fund the Debt Financing
or the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at the Merger Closing and (C)
if at any time for any reason Parent believes that it will not be able to
obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions,
in the manner or from the sources, contemplated by any of the Debt Commitment
Letters or Financing Agreements or will be unable to obtain Alternative
Financing. Parent shall promptly provide any information reasonably requested
by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B) or
(C) of the immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

(f) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining
of the Debt Financing is not a condition to the Merger Closing, and reaffirms
its obligations under this _Section 6.11_.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Financing Cooperation_. (a) Subject to _Section 6.11(a)_ and
the remaining provisions of this _Section 6.12_, prior to the Merger Closing,
the Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at Parents sole
expense, reasonably cooperate in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing or any Alternative Financing, which cooperation by the Company shall
consist of, at the reasonable request of Parent, (i) furnishing Parent with
all financial statements and financial and other data of the type customary
for a confidential information memorandum in connection with the Debt
Financing, including the information required by paragraph 4 of Exhibit C to
the Debt Commitment Letters (the " **Required Financial Information** ");
_provided_ , that such information shall not include, and Parent shall be
solely responsible for, the preparation of pro forma financial information,
including pro forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization or other pro forma

the case of the Company) and _Section 7.3_ (in the case of Parent) have been
satisfied or give rise to any right of termination to any party hereto under
_Article VIII_.

contrary herein, Parent may in its sole discretion waive any such Required

violation of applicable Law; _provided_ that (i) Parent has confirmed in an
irrevocable written notice delivered to the Company that all of the conditions

withdrawn (provided, that, prior to asserting this condition, the party

correct at and as of the date of this Agreement and the Merger Closing Date

of such date), except in the case of clause _(ii)_ for such failures to be
true and correct as would not constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect;

all agreements and covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or
complied with by it on or prior to the Merger Closing Date;

 



 

(c) since the date of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred any

Closing Date and signed by an executive officer of the Company, certifying to
the effect

of an earlier date, in which case as of such date), except for such failures
to be true and correct as would not constitute, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect;

 



 

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed or complied in all material
respects with all agreements and covenants required by this Agreement to be
performed or complied with by them on or prior to the Merger Closing Date; and

Parent or Merger Sub to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement.
The Company may not rely on the failure of any conditions set forth in
_Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.3_ to be satisfied if such failure was caused by
the failure of the Company to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII**

 



 

 ** _TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER_**

 



 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained

to a date not later than January 30, 2014; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall
not be available to either party if it has materially breached or violated any

breach or violation has been the principal cause of or directly resulted in
(1) the failure to satisfy the conditions to the obligations of the
terminating party to consummate the Merger set forth in _Article VII_ prior
to the Termination Date (as the same may be extended) or (2) the failure of
the Merger Closing to occur by the Termination Date (as the same may be
extended); or

 



 

(ii) any Restraint shall be in effect enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger, and such Restraint shall have become final and
non-appealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the party seeking to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ shall have complied with
its obligations under _Section 6.3_ with respect to such Restraint; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a party if the issuance of
such final, non-appealable Restraint was primarily due to the failure of such
party, and in the case of Parent, including the failure of Merger Sub, to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement; or

 



 

(iii) the Requisite Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof; or

 



 

(c) by the Company if:

 



 

(i) Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of their
respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set
forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (x) would give
rise to a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section
7.3(b)_ and (y) (A) is not capable of being cured prior to the Termination
Date or (B) is not cured by Parent or Merger Sub on or before the earlier of

has determined to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect
to a Superior Proposal to the extent permitted by, and subject to the terms

set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _7.2_ have been satisfied or waived (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Merger
Closing, _provided_ that such conditions are reasonably capable of being
satisfied), and Parent and Merger Sub have failed to consummate the Merger by

a result of a breach by the Financing Sources of their obligations to make
available to Parent and Merger Sub the full amount of the Debt Financing
pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters (or if definitive agreements have been
entered into in connection with the Debt Financing, pursuant to such
definitive agreements).

 



 

(d) by Parent:

 



 

(i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its

reasonable detail, and, except as set forth in this _Section 8.2_, this
Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and of no effect without
liability on the part of any party hereto (or any of its Representatives), and

(c) _Integral Part of Transaction_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) none of the Company

that will compensate Parent or the Company (as applicable) in the
circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these agreements, the parties
would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay the Company
Termination Fee, or if Parent fails to pay the Funding Failure Termination Fee
or the Regulatory Failure Termination Fee, in each case pursuant to this
_Section 8.3_ when due, and, in order to obtain such payment, any other party
hereto commences a suit that results in a judgment against such party for the
Company Termination Fee, the Funding Failure Termination Fee or the

 



      
 

 



 

Regulatory Failure Termination Fee, as the case may be, such party shall pay
to such other party interest on the amount of the Company Termination Fee, the
Funding Failure Termination Fee or the Regulatory Failure Termination Fee, as
the case may be, from the date such payment was required to be made until the
date of payment at the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of
the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards
of directors at any time before or after receipt of the Requisite Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Requisite Stockholder
Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment that by Law
requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such
further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto;
_provided_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
_Section 8.3(b)(iii)_, _Section 8.3(c)_, this _Section 8.4_, _Section
9.7_, _Section 9.8_, _Section 9.9(b)_ , _Section 9.10(c)_, _Section 9.12_
or _Section 9.14_ (in each case, together with any related definitions and
other provisions of this Agreement to the extent a modification or termination
would serve to modify the substance or provisions or such Sections) may not be
amended, modified, waived or terminated in a manner that is adverse to the
Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject
to the proviso of the first sentence of _Section 8.4_, waive compliance with
any agreement or condition contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right
hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party to any extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such party.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Expenses_. Except as expressly set forth herein (including
_Section 6.12(b)_, _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_ and _Section 9.13_), all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and

Section 9.3 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_. The parties have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement. The inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Letter
or Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence
of materiality of such item, nor shall it establish any standard of
materiality for any purpose whatsoever. No disclosure in the Company
Disclosure Letter relating to any possible breach or violation of any contract
or Law shall be construed as an admission or indication with respect to any
third party that any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.
When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section, Appendix,
Schedule, Annex or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or Section
of, or an Appendix, Schedule, Annex or Exhibit to, this Agreement, unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings for this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby,"
"hereto" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole, including all Exhibits,
Schedules and Annexes and Appendices, and not to any particular provision of
this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined
meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered
pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in
this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of
such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders
of such term. Any Law defined or referred to herein or in any

 



      
 

 



 

agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such Law as from time
to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of statutes)
by succession of comparable successor Laws and the related regulations and
published interpretations thereof; provided, that for purposes of any
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement that are made as of
a specific date or dates, references to any Law shall be deemed to refer to
such Law, as amended, and to any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder,
in each case, as of such date. References to a Person are also to its
successors and permitted assigns. The words "made available to Parent" or
words of similar import refer to documents (x) posted to the Electronic Data
Room on or prior to the date hereof or (y) delivered in Person or
electronically to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives. The specification of any dollar amount in any representation
or warranty contained in _Article IV_ or _Article V_ is not intended to
imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, are or are not material
for purposes of this Agreement, and no party shall use the fact of the setting
forth of any such amount in any dispute or controversy between or among the
parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or
included in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter is
or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. The phrases "the date of
this Agreement" and "the date hereof" and terms or phrases of similar import
shall be deemed to refer to January 30, 2013, unless the context requires
otherwise. When used in reference to the Company or its Subsidiaries, the term
"material" shall be measured against the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if". The word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning
and effect as the word "shall." References to "$" or "dollars" in this
Agreement shall mean United States dollars. Words describing the singular
number shall be deemed to include the plural and vice versa, words denoting
any gender shall be deemed to include all genders and words denoting natural
Persons shall be deemed to include business entities and vice versa.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
void, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future Law,
or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully separable,
(b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, and (c) all
other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in a mutually acceptable manner in
order that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto. Subject to the proceeding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective permitted successors and permitted assigns.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits,
Schedules, Annexes and Appendices hereto and other documents delivered
pursuant hereto) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, the entire
agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties and their Affiliates, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except
for (a) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of the Companys
stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time, (b)
from and after the Effective Time, the right of the holders of Company Options
to receive the Option Cash Payment at the Effective Time, (c) from and after
the Effective Time, the right of the holders of Company Restricted Shares,
Company Restricted Share Units or Company Phantom Units to receive the
Restricted Award Payments at the Effective Time, (d) from and after the

receive the Performance Unit Payments at the Effective Time, (e) from and
after the Effective Time, the right of the holders of Company Warrants to

the Company, on behalf of the holders of Company Common Stock, the holders of
Company Restricted Shares, Company Restricted Share Units or Company Phantom
Units, the holders of Company Options and the holders of Performance Units and
the holders of Company Warrants, as applicable, to pursue damages (including
damages for their loss of economic benefits from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement) (" **Derivative Damages** ") in the event of Parents or
Merger Subs breach of this Agreement or fraud, which right is hereby
acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub ( _provided_ that this clause
is not intended, and under no circumstances shall be deemed, to create any
right of the holders of Company Common Stock, the holders of Company
Restricted Shares, Company Restricted Share Units or Company Phantom Units,
the holders of Company Options and the holders of Performance Units and the
holders of Company Warrants to bring an action against Parent or Merger Sub
pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise), (g) the provisions of _Section 6.6_
(which shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees), (h) the provisions of
_Section 6.12(b)_ (which shall be enforceable by the 6.12 Indemnitees) and
(i) with respect to the Financing Sources, the provisions of _Section
8.3(b)(iii)_ , _Section 8.3(c)_, _Section 8.4_, this _Section 9.7_,
_Section 9.8_, _Section 9.9(b)_, _Section 9.10(c)_, _Section 9.12_ and
_Section 9.14_. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit
of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties
are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 8.5_
without notice or liability to any other Person. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the Knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Accordingly, Persons other than the parties
hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or
counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company in the negotiation,

 



      
 

 



 

administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Except as
expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements
related thereto, all actions, proceedings, or counterclaims (whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise) against the Financing Sources arising out of or
relating to the Debt Financing and the performance thereof by the Financing
Sources shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of New York, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws
provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of New York.

 



 

Section 9.9 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, except as otherwise
set forth in this _Section 9.9_ , including the limitations set forth in
_Section 9.9(b)_, the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties hereto
shall be entitled, without posting a bond or other indemnity, to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and
agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of
Parents and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the Merger only in the
event that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) the
Marketing Period, if applicable, has ended and all of the conditions set forth
in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Merger
Closing, _provided_ that such conditions are reasonably capable of being
satisfied), (ii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Merger Closing by
the date the Merger Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section
2.2_, (iii) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Merger
Closing assuming satisfaction by Parent or Merger Sub of the conditions
precedent thereto under their respective control, and (iv) the Company has
confirmed in an irrevocable written notice delivered to Parent that if
specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing is funded, then the
Merger Closing will occur. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) in no event shall
the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parents
and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the Merger if the Debt Financing
has not been funded other than in conjunction with any Proceedings in which
the Company concurrently pursues its rights under _Section 9.9(c)_ (it being
understood that specific performance shall only be available if Parent or
Merger Sub are successful in obtaining specific performance as contemplated in
_Section 9.9(c)_) and (y) while the Company may pursue both a grant of
specific performance as and only to the extent expressly permitted by this
_Section 9.9_ and the payment of the Funding Failure Termination Fee (only to
the extent expressly permitted by _Section 8.3(a)(iv)_), under no

 



       
 

 



 

circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both such
grant of specific performance and payment of the Funding Failure Termination
Fee.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and
agreed that, in the event of a failure or threatened failure of Parent and
Merger Sub to enforce the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters, the Company
shall be entitled to specific performance to cause Parent and Merger Sub to
enforce the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters or any Financing Agreements
related thereto, including by requiring that Parent and Merger Sub file one or
more lawsuits against the Financing Sources to fully enforce such Financing
Sources obligations thereunder and Parents and Merger Subs rights
thereunder, but only in the event that each of the following conditions has
been satisfied: (i) the Marketing Period, if applicable, has ended and all of
the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ have been satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
or waived at the Merger Closing, _provided_ that such conditions are
reasonably capable of being satisfied), (ii) all of the conditions to the
consummation of the Debt Financing provided for in the Debt Commitment Letters
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes alternative financing, if any,
that is being used in accordance with _Section 6.11_, pursuant to the
commitments with respect thereto) or any Financing Agreements related thereto
have been satisfied (other than (x) any conditions that are within the control
of Parent or Merger Sub and (y) those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied by actions taken at the Merger Closing, _provided_ that such
conditions are reasonably capable of being satisfied) and (iii) the Company
has confirmed in an irrevocable written notice delivered to Parent and the
Financing Sources that if specific performance is granted and the Debt
Financing is funded, then the Merger Closing will occur.

 



 

(d) Subject to _Section 9.9(b)_ and _(c)_ , each party hereby agrees not to
raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by such party,
and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of such Party under this Agreement all in accordance
with the terms of this _Section 9.9_. Any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with such order or injunction all in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 9.9_. The parties hereto further
agree, subject to _Section 9.9(b)_, that (i) by seeking the remedies provided
for in this _Section 9.9_, a party shall not in any respect waive its right
to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a party under this
Agreement in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event
that the remedies provided for in this _Section 9.9_ are not available or
otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section 9.9_
shall require any party hereto to institute any proceeding for (or limit any
partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this
_Section 9.9_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right
under _Article VIII_, nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding
pursuant to this _Section 9.9_ or anything set forth in this _Section 9.9_
restrict or limit any partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of _Article VIII_ or pursue any other remedies under this
Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. (a) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts

this Agreement, or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, and each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect to
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined exclusively in any
Delaware state or federal court.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto (a) irrevocably consents to the service of the
summons and complaint and any other process in any other action or proceeding
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of
itself or its property, by personal delivery of copies of such process to such
party and nothing in this _Section 9.10_ shall affect the right of any party
to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law, (b) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery,
any other court of the State of Delaware and any Federal court sitting in the
State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (c) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court and (d) agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if (but
only if) the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any other court
of the State of Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware). Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final
judgment in any action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by Law.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto hereby agrees
that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or

referred to as the "Corporation").

authorized to issue is one thousand one hundred (1,100) shares of stock. One
thousand (1000) shares shall be designated common stock ("Common Stock"). One
hundred (100) shares shall be designated preferred stock ("Preferred Stock"),
all of which are presently undesignated to a series. The Board of Directors of
the Corporation is hereby authorized from time to time to provide by
resolution for the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series
not exceeding the aggregate number of shares of Preferred Stock authorized by
this Certificate of Incorporation, as amended from time to time; and to
determine with respect to each such series the voting powers, if any (which
voting powers if granted may be full or limited), designations,

      
 

 



 

preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and
the qualifications, limitations or restrictions relating thereto; including
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the voting rights relating
to shares of Preferred Stock of any series (which may be one or more votes per
share or a fraction of a vote per share, which may vary over time and which
may be applicable generally or only upon the happening and continuance of
stated events or conditions), the rate of dividend to which holders of
Preferred Stock of any series may be entitled (which may be cumulative or
noncumulative), the rights of holders of Preferred Stock of any series in the
event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the
Corporation, the rights, if any, of holders of Preferred Stock of any series
to convert or exchange such shares of Preferred Stock of such series for
shares of any other class or series of capital stock or for any other
securities, property or assets of the Corporation or any subsidiary (including
the determination of the price or prices or the rate or rates applicable to
such rights to convert or exchange and the adjustment thereof, the time or
times during which the right to convert or exchange shall be applicable and
the time or times during which a particular price or rate shall be
applicable), whether or not the shares of that series shall be redeemable,
and, if so, the terms and conditions of such redemption, including the date or
dates upon or after which they shall be redeemable, and the amount per share
payable in case of redemption, which amount may vary under different
conditions and at different redemption dates, and whether any shares of that
series shall be redeemed pursuant to a retirement or sinking fund or otherwise
and the terms and conditions of such obligation.

 



 

Each share of Preferred Stock shall have a par value of $0.01 and each share
of Common Stock shall have a par value of $0.01.

      
 

 



 

FIFTH: The following provisions are inserted for the management of the
business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for
further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation
and of its directors and stockholders:

 



 

(1) The number of directors of the Corporation shall be such as from time to
time shall be fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the by-laws. Election of
directors need not be by ballot unless the by-laws so provide.

 



 

(2) The Board of Directors shall have powers without the assent or vote of the
stockholders to make, alter, amend, change, add to or repeal the by-laws of
the Corporation; to fix and vary the amount to be reserved for any proper
purpose; to authorize and cause to be executed mortgages and liens upon all or
any part of the property of the Corporation; to determine the use and
disposition of any surplus or net profits; and to fix the times for the
declaration and payment of dividends.

 



 

(3) The directors in their discretion may submit any contract or act for
approval or ratification at any annual meeting of the stockholders or at any
meeting of the stockholders called for the purpose of considering any such act
or contract, and any contract or act that shall be approved or be ratified by
the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation which is
represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote thereat
(provided that a lawful quorum of stockholders be there represented in person
or by proxy) shall be as valid and as binding upon the Corporation and upon
all the stockholders as though it had been approved or ratified by every
stockholder of the Corporation, whether or not the contract or act would
otherwise be open to legal attack because of directors interest, or for any
other reason.

      
 

 



 

(4) In addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore or by statute
expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise
all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by
the Corporation; subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the statutes of
Delaware, of this certificate, and to any by-laws from time to time made by
the stockholders; provided, however, that no by-laws so made shall invalidate
any prior act of the directors which would have been valid if such by-law had
not been made.

 



 

SIXTH: The Corporation shall, to the full extent permitted by Section 145 of
the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended from time to time, indemnify
all persons whom it may indemnify pursuant thereto.

 



 

SEVENTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the
Corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between the
Corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable
jurisdiction within the State of Delaware, may, on the application in a
summary way of the Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on
the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation
under the provisions of section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the
application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers
appointed for the Corporation under the provisions of section 279 of Title 8
of the Delaware Code order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors,
and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the
case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs. If a
majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or
class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the
Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to
any reorganization of the Corporation as consequence

      
 

 



 

of such compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the
said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said
application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of
creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of the
Corporation, as the case may be, and also on the Corporation.

 



 

EIGHTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal
any provision contained in this certificate of incorporation in the manner now
or hereafter prescribed by law, and all rights and powers conferred herein on
stockholders, directors and officers are subject to this reserved power.

 



 

NINTH: The personal liability of the directors of the Corporation is hereby
eliminated to the fullest extent permitted by paragraph (7) of subsection (b)
of Section 102 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the
same may be amended or supplemented.

      
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, WMS Industries Inc. has caused this Certificate of
Incorporation to be executed by the Chief Executive Officer this [].
