(d) promptly advise Buyer in writing of any loss or threatened loss of a

the Company from making tax distributions prior to the Closing of all amounts
that may be necessary to reimburse the Sellers from any and all Tax
liabilities they may incur as a result of Taxes that arise from the business
and operations of the Company for the Pre-Closing Tax Period; _provided that_
the Company shall not make a change in method of accounting for a taxable
period ending on or prior to the Closing Time, including any adjustment under
§ 481(c) of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local or
foreign Law) and _provided further_ that Buyer shall have the opportunity to
review calculations of such distributions and provide meaningful comment prior
to any such distributions being made.

 

Section 7.05 _Access_.

 

The Company shall, and Sellers will cause the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries to, permit representatives of Buyer (including legal counsel,
accountants and environmental consultants) to have access at all reasonable
times and on reasonable notice, and in a manner so as not to unreasonably
interfere with the normal business operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, to all premises, properties, books, records (including tax
records), contracts, documents, officers, employees, accountants and attorneys
(including patent attorneys) of or pertaining to the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries; _provided, however_ , Buyer shall not contact any employees
other than executive officers without the permission of either of the Key
Employees. Buyer will treat and hold any such information that it receives
from any of Sellers, the Company, and its Subsidiaries in the course of the
reviews contemplated by this _Section 7.05_ as Confidential Information.
Buyer will not use any of the Confidential Information except in connection
with this Agreement, and, if this Agreement is terminated for any
reason whatsoever, will return to Sellers, the Company, and its Subsidiaries
all copies of the Confidential Information that are in its possession in
whatever form and to the extent that electronic formats cannot be returned
Buyer shall delete such files and records from its systems. This _Section
7.05_ is in addition to and does not supersede any obligations of Buyer under
the Non-Disclosure Agreement.

 

Section 7.06 _Notice of Developments_.

 

(a) The Company or Sellers, as applicable, shall promptly notify Buyer in
writing if it or they become aware of any breach of any of
the representations and warranties in _Article IV_ (by the Sellers) or
_Article VI_ (by the Company) above. The Company and Sellers may also update
or complete the information in any Disclosure Schedule by providing written
notice of such update to the Buyer. Any written notice pursuant to this
_Section 7.06(a)_ will be deemed to have amended the Disclosure Schedules and
to have qualified the representations and warranties contained in _Article IV_
and _Article VI_ above, and such notice shall cure any misrepresentation or
breach of representation or warranty that otherwise would exist in the absence
of such notice, but only to the extent that the aggregate value of potential
Losses related 

 



-43-  to all such misrepresentations or breaches is less than $2 million,
individually or in the aggregate. To the extent that the aggregate Losses
related to such misrepresentation or breach exceeds $2 million, individually
or in the aggregate, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement (including _Article IX_ and _Article X_ ), only the aggregate amount
of Losses that exceed $2 million (the " _Excess Value_ ") shall be taken into
account in determining whether the condition set forth in _Section 9.01(a)_
has been satisfied or whether there has been a Material Adverse Effect for the
purposes of _Section 9.01(e)_. The Notice by the Company or Sellers to Buyer
of any Excess Value shall not cure any misrepresentation or breach of
representation or warranty with respect to such Excess Value except if such
notice is regarding a development that would constitute or cause a Material
Adverse Effect and Buyer elects to proceed with the Closing.

(b) Buyer shall promptly notify Securityholders Representative in writing of
any development causing a breach of any of the representations and warranties
in _Article V_ above. Any written notice pursuant to this _Section 7.06(b)_
will be deemed to have qualified the representations and warranties contained
in _Article V_ above, but any such notice shall not cure any misrepresentation
or breach of representation or warranty that otherwise would exist in the
absence of such notice except if such notice is regarding a development that
would constitute or cause a Buyer Material Adverse Effect and the Company and
Sellers elect to proceed with the Closing.

 

Section 7.07 _Tax Matters_.

 

Without the prior written consent of Buyer, Sellers shall not permit or cause
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make or change any election, change
an annual accounting period, adopt or change any accounting method, file any
amended Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement, settle any Tax claim or
assessment relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, surrender
any right to claim a refund of Taxes, consent to any extension or waiver of
the limitation period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or take any other similar action
relating to the filing of any Tax Return or the payment of any Tax, if such
election, adoption, change, amendment, agreement, settlement, surrender,
consent or other action would have the effect of increasing the Tax liability
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any period ending after the
Closing Date or decreasing any Tax attribute of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries existing on the Closing Date. Sellers shall not cause or permit
the Company to revoke or cause or permit to be revoked the Companys election
to be taxed as a partnership for Income Tax purposes.

Section 7.08 _Amendment of Equity Awards_.

 

Prior to the Closing and as soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall, and Sellers shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, adopt any resolutions and to take any actions which are
reasonably necessary in accordance with applicable Laws and, as applicable,
the Company Option Plans and each agreement evidencing a grant of Company
Options (a " _Company Option Agreement_ ") (including obtaining necessary
consents or amendments), to (i) effectuate the provisions of _Section 2.03_
and (ii) terminate, upon the Closing Time, each Company Option Plan, each
Company Option Agreement, such that, at the Closing Time and upon the payments
contemplated hereunder, no Person shall have any right to purchase or receive
any Company Equity Interest, or right convertible into or exercisable for
any membership interest units or other Company Equity Interest.

 



-44- Section 7.09 _Exclusivity_.

officer, manager, employee, shareholder, trustee or member of the Company, any

business combination transaction involving the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, any of the Transferred Interests or any material assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company and Sellers shall notify Buyer
of any such written inquiry or proposal within 24 hours after receipt or
awareness of the same by any Seller or the Company. In consideration for the
substantial expenditures of time, effort and expense to be undertaken by Buyer
in connection with the preparation and execution of this Agreement, the
Company, the Sellers and Buyer agree that money damages would not be a
sufficient remedy for any breach of this _Section 7.08_ by the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries, any Seller or any director, manager, officer, employee,
shareholder, trustee or member of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
any Seller and that, in addition to all other remedies, Buyer shall be
entitled to obtain specific performance and injunctive or other equitable
relief as a remedy for any breach of this _Section 7.08_.

of customers provision contained therein is intended to replace and supersede
this _Section 8.06_, this _Section 8.06_ shall not apply to such Seller.

 

Section 8.07 _Acknowledgments; Enforcement_.

 

(a) Sellers acknowledge that, in view of the nature of Buyers business and
the business objectives of Buyer in acquiring the Company, and the
consideration paid to Sellers for the Transferred Interests, the restrictions
and covenants contained or referenced in _Section 8.04_, _Section 8.05_,
_Section 8.06_ and _Section 8.08_ of this Agreement are reasonably
necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company and
Buyer and that any violation of such restrictions and covenants will result in
irreparable injury to the Company and Buyer and their Affiliates for which
damages will not be an adequate remedy. Sellers therefore acknowledge that, if
any such restrictions or covenants are violated, in addition to obtaining
compensation for damages, Buyer shall be entitled to seek to obtain
preliminary and injunctive relief against the violating party as well to an
equitable accounting of earnings, profits and other benefits arising from such
violation.

 

(b) If, at the time of enforcement of any covenant contained in _Section
8.04_, _Section 8.05_, _Section 8.06_ or _Section 8.08_ of this Agreement,
a court or other Governmental Entity shall hold that the duration, scope or
geographic restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances
then existing, the Parties agree that the maximum duration, scope or
geographic area reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted for
the stated duration, scope or geographic area and that the court or other
Governmental Entity shall be allowed and directed to revise the
restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum period, scope and
geographic area permitted by Law.

Section 8.08 _Confidentiality_.

 

Neither Sellers nor any of their respective Affiliates shall use or divulge
any trade secrets, customer or supplier lists, pricing information, marketing
arrangements or strategies, business plans, internal performance statistics,
training manuals or any other information concerning the Company or relating
to the Companys business that is competitively sensitive, proprietary or
confidential (collectively, " _Proprietary Information_ ") except on behalf of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
confidentiality covenants contained in this  _Section 8.08_ shall not apply
to the following: (i) information that is already in the public domain or
generally available to Persons in the same or similar industries as the
Company; (ii) information that becomes part of the public domain or generally
available to Persons in the same or similar industries as the Company by
publication or otherwise other than through any action on the part of Seller,
any Affiliate thereof or any Seller; (iii) information that the Sellers or
their Affiliates received from a third party who was not legally or
contractually prohibited from disclosing such information; or (iv) information
that the Sellers or their Affiliates are legally compelled to disclose, but
only as to the disclosure. In the event that any Seller or Affiliate thereof
becomes legally compelled to disclose any Proprietary Information, such Seller
or Affiliate thereof will notify Buyer promptly in writing of such requirement
so that Buyer may seek a protective order

 



-48-  or other appropriate remedy or, in Buyers sole discretion, waive compliance
with the terms of this _Section 8.08_. In the event that no such protective
order or other remedy is obtained, or that Buyer waives compliance with the
terms of this _Section 8.08_, such Seller or Affiliate thereof, as the case
may be, will furnish only that portion of the Proprietary Information which
such Seller Affiliate thereof is advised by counsel is legally required and
will exercise commercially reasonable efforts, at Buyers sole expense, to
obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
furnished Proprietary Information.

 

Section 8.09 _Post-Closing Tax Matters_.

 

The following provisions shall govern certain post-closing Tax matters as
described herein:

 

(a) _Straddle Period_. In the case of any taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (a  _ Straddle Period_), the amount of
any Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts, or payroll of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based
on a closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-
through entity in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time), and the
amount of other Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for a Straddle
Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period. In the case of a Tax that is (x) paid for the privilege of
doing business during a period (a " _Privilege Period_ ") and (y) computed
based on business activity occurring during an accounting period ending prior
to such Privilege Period, any reference to a "Tax period," a "tax period," or
a "taxable period" shall mean such accounting period and not such Privilege
Period.

(b) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_. Sellers shall prepare or cause
to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Income Tax Returns for the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date that are filed after the Closing Date. Sellers shall permit Buyer to
review and comment on each such Income Tax Return described in the preceding
sentence prior to filing. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Sellers
shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction or other Tax items for such
periods on their Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Schedule K-1s
prepared by Sellers for such periods. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and file or cause to be filed all other Tax Returns for the Company
and its Subsidiaries for all periods ending after the Closing Date that are
filed after the Closing Date. Buyer shall permit the Securityholders
Representative to review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the
preceding sentence prior to filing if such Tax Returns result in an
indemnification obligation of Sellers.

(c) _Purchase Price Allocation_. Not later than 90 days after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Securityholders Representative a
tentative copy of Form 8594 and any required exhibits thereto (the " _Asset
Acquisition Statement_ ") allocating the Purchase Price, subject to
adjustment pursuant to _Section 10.06_ below, among the assets of the
Company. Securityholders Representative shall have 30 days after receipt of
the Asset

 



-49-  Acquisition Statement to notify Buyer in writing of any objections. If
Securityholders Representative does not object in writing during such 30 day
period, the Asset Acquisition Statement shall be final and binding on all
Parties. If Securityholders Representative objects in writing during such
thirty 30 day period, Securityholders Representative and Buyer will attempt in
good faith to resolve the disputed items. If Securityholders Representative
and Buyer are unable to reach an agreement within 60 days of Securityholders
Representatives receipt of the Asset Acquisition Statement, any disputed
items shall be referred to the Independent Auditor for resolution.
The determination of the Independent Auditor shall be final and binding on
all Parties, and the fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall
be split equally between Securityholders Representative and Buyer. Sellers and
Buyer further agree that any mutually agreed-upon allocation is subject to
adjustment pursuant to _Section 10.06_ below and any indemnification payments
paid to Buyer pursuant to _Section 10.02_ or to Sellers pursuant to _Section
10.03_. Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Securityholders Representative
from time to time revised copies of the Asset Acquisition Statement so as to
report any adjustments pursuant to _Section 10.06_ below and any
indemnification payments paid to Buyer pursuant to _Section 10.02_ or to
Sellers pursuant to _Section 10.03_. Sellers and Buyer each agree to file all
Income Tax Returns and reports consistent with the foregoing and in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Code.

(d) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

 

(i) Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and Sellers shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by any other Party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section 8.09_,
and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Partys request)
the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any
such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder.

(ii) Buyer and the Sellers further agree, upon request, to use their best
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

 

Section 8.10 _Manager, Director and Officer Indemnification_.

 

For a period of not less than six years after the Closing, Buyer shall, and
shall cause any of its successors and assigns and the Company and any of
their respective successors and assigns to, (i) defend, indemnify and hold
harmless each Covered Person, from and against any and all Losses incurred or
suffered by any Covered Person in connection with any liabilities or any
action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out
of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing
Date, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing Date, to
the fullest extent that the Company is permitted under applicable law and
under its limited liability company agreement, in each case as in effect on
the Closing Date, to indemnify such Covered Persons and (ii) advance expenses
as incurred by any Covered Person in connection with any matters for which
such Covered Person is entitled to indemnification from Buyer and the Company
pursuant to this _Section 8.10_ to the fullest extent

 



-50-  permitted under applicable law or, if greater, under the limited liability
company agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Covered Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately and finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that
all rights of appeal have lapsed and that such Covered Person is not entitled
to indemnification under applicable law or the limited liability company
agreement, and pursuant to this _Section 8.10._ The Covered Persons are
intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section 8.10._

 

Section 8.11 _Legends; Restriction on Transfer_.

 

(a) Each Seller acknowledges that the shares of Buyer Common Stock comprising
its Allocable Portion of the Stock Consideration have not been registered
under the Securities Act and agrees to a restrictive notation substantially
similar to the following on any book-entry account reflecting the issuance of
such shares (or any securities issued in respect of or exchange therefor)
together with such other restrictive notations as may be required by
applicable Blue Sky Laws:

"THESE SHARES OF STOCK HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED OR QUALIFIED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE, AND
MAY BE OFFERED AND SOLD ONLY IF REGISTERED AND QUALIFIED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL
AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR IF THE COMPANY IS PROVIDED AN OPINION OF COUNSEL
SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THAT REGISTRATION AND QUALIFICATION UNDER FEDERAL
AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS IS NOT REQUIRED."

 

(b) Each Seller agrees it shall not sell, transfer, assign, gift, pledge,
suffer a Lien to be placed upon or otherwise dispose of the shares of Buyer
Common Stock comprising its Allocable Portion of the Stock Consideration or
any securities issued in respect of or exchange for such shares (the "
_Sellers Shares_ "), until the earlier of (1) such time as such shares are
registered for resale pursuant to the provisions of _Section 7.03_ hereof or
(2) such shares being eligible for sale under an applicable exemption to the
Securities Act.

 

(c) In order to enforce the covenant contained in _Section 8.11(b)_, Buyer
may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the Sellers Shares
until the end of such period. Any purported sale, transfer, assignment, gift,
pledge, Lien or other disposition of the Sellers Shares in violation of the
covenant contained in _Section 8.11(b)_ shall be null and void.

 

Section 8.12 _Brokers  Fees_.

 

Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Sellers from any liability for any
commission or compensation in the nature of a finders or brokers fee
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (and the
costs and expenses of defending against such liability or asserted liability)
for which Buyer or any of its officers, employees, representatives
or Affiliates is responsible.

 



-51- Section 8.13 _Litigation Proceeds_.

 

 __Following the Closing, in the event that the Company shall be awarded or
otherwise receive by way of settlement or otherwise cash resulting from
counterclaims filed by the Company in connection with the Known Litigation
Claims and Liabilities (such cash amounts, the " _Counterclaim Proceeds_ "),
the Parties agree that such Counterclaim Proceeds shall be distributed by the
Company (and Buyer shall cause the Company to so distribute such proceeds) as
follows within 15 Business Days of the Companys receipt thereof: __

 

(a) First, to Buyer until such time as Buyer has received an amount equal to

shareholders, employees and managers (the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ")
from and against any Losses any Seller Indemnified Party shall suffer,
directly or indirectly, resulting from, in connection with or related to:

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty (other than the Fundamental
Representations and Warranties) made by Buyer contained in this Agreement;

 

(ii) the breach of any of the Fundamental Representations and Warranties made
by Buyer contained in this Agreement; and/or

 

(iii) the breach or non-performance of any covenant or agreement of Buyer
contained in this Agreement;

 

(b) Buyer shall not have any obligation to indemnify the Seller Indemnified
Parties from and against Losses described in  _Section 10.03(a)(i)_ and
_Section 10.03(a)(ii)_ above until the Seller Indemnified Parties
collectively have suffered Losses by reason of all such breaches in excess of
the Deductible, in which event only the amounts sought by the Seller
Indemnified Parties in excess of the Deductible shall be subject to
indemnification.

(c) Buyer shall not have any obligation to indemnify the Seller Indemnified
Parties from and against Losses described in _Section 10.03(a)(i)_ in excess
of the Cap.

 

(d) Solely for purposes of calculating the amount of Losses incurred arising
out of or relating to any breach of a representation or warranty (and not for
purposes of determining whether or not a breach has occurred), the references
to "Material Adverse Effect" or other materiality qualifications (or
correlative terms) contained in such representations or warranties, shall
be disregarded.

 



-57- Section 10.04 _Matters Involving Third Parties_.

 

(a) If any third Person shall notify any Party (such Party, together with any
other Person entitled to indemnification hereunder, the " _Indemnified Party_
") with respect to any matter (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") which may give rise
to a claim for indemnification against any other Party (such Party, together
with any other Party required to provide indemnification hereunder, the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") under this _Article X_ , then the Indemnified Party
shall promptly notify each Indemnifying Party thereof in writing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure of the Indemnified Party to provide timely
notice shall not result in the forfeiture of any rights of the Indemnified
Party except to the extent such failure results in the loss or waiver of
substantive defenses of the Indemnifying Party. 

(b) Any Indemnifying Party will have the right at any time to assume and
thereafter conduct the defense of the Third-Party Claim with counsel of his,
her, or its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the
defense of a Third-Party Claim: (i) the Indemnifying Party shall diligently
conduct the defense and, so long as it diligently conducts the defense, shall
not be liable to the Indemnified Party for its fees or expenses subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of the Third-
Party Claim other than reasonable costs of investigation; (ii) the
Indemnifying Party shall admit in writing that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement for the entirety of any Loss
arising, directly or indirectly, from or in connection with the Third-Party
Claim, subject to the limits of liability set forth in this _Article X_ ;
(iii) the Loss that can be reasonably anticipated to be incurred in connection
with such Third Party Claim is within the limits of liability set forth in
this _Article X_ ; (iv) no compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim
may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Partys
consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation by the
Indemnified Party of any applicable Laws or any rights of any Person, (B) the
Indemnified Party receives a full release of and from any other claims that
may be made against the Indemnified Party by the third party bringing the
Third-Party Claim, and (C) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that
are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party; and (v) the Indemnified Person
shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such
claims effected without its consent. All costs and expenses incurred by the
Indemnifying Party in defending such Third Party Claim shall be paid by the
Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) counsel for
the Indemnified Party is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party,
(ii) the Indemnified Party keeps the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of
the progress of any Third Party Claim including providing copies of notices,
pleadings and court submissions, and (iii) permits counsel for the
Indemnifying Party to assist in the defense of any Third Party Claim.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a Third-Party
Claim in the manner provided in _Section 10.04(b)_ or if the Indemnifying
Party does not conduct

 



-58-  the defense of a Third-Party Claim in the manner provided in _Section
10.04(b)_, the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by any determination
resulting from such Third-Party Claim or any compromise or settlement
effected by the Indemnified Party

(d) Unless and until an Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third-
Party Claim as provided in _Section 10.04(b)_, however, the Indemnified Party
may defend against the Third-Party Claim in any manner he, she, or it may
reasonably deem necessary and appropriate.

 

(e) Any Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with the
Indemnifying Parties and their attorneys in the investigation, trial and
defense of such Third Party Claim and any appeal arising therefrom and shall
furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably
requested in connection therewith. Such cooperation shall include access
during normal business hours afforded to the Indemnifying Party and its agents
and representatives to records and information which are reasonably relevant
to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
materials provided hereunder. The Parties shall cooperate with each other in
any notifications to insurers.

 

(f) All indemnification payments under this _Article X_ shall be deemed
adjustments to the Purchase Price.

 

Section 10.05 _Exclusive Remedy_.

 

Except (i) in the case of fraud or criminal acts, (ii) in the case of a
violation of a restrictive covenant contained in  _Section 8.04_, _Section
8.05_, _Section 8.06 _or _Section 8.08_ above and (iii) as otherwise
provided in _Section 12.17_ below, the rights and remedies under this
_Article X_ are exclusive and in lieu of any and all other rights and
remedies that Sellers and Buyer may have under this Agreement or otherwise
against each other with respect to any breach of any representation or
warranty or any failure to perform any covenant or agreement set forth in
this Agreement, and each Seller and Buyer expressly waives any and all other
rights, remedies and causes of action it or its Affiliates may have against
any other Party or its Affiliates now or in the future under any Law with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except in the case
of fraud or criminal acts, or such a violation of _Section 8.04_, _Section
8.05_, _Section 8.06_ or _Section 8.08_, the remedies expressly provided in
this Agreement shall constitute the sole and exclusive basis for and means of
recourse between the Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

Section 10.06 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.

 

(a) _Notification of Claims_. Upon an Indemnified Party becoming aware of a
fact, condition or event that constitutes a basis for a claim for
indemnification hereunder against another party under _Section 10.02_ or
_Section 10.03_ above, as the case may be, if such a claim is to be made, the
Indemnified Party will with reasonable promptness and specificity notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of such fact, condition or event within any
applicable survival period and include therein a bill (if applicable),
together with any relevant back-up

 



-59-  documentation and a reasonable good faith estimate of the amount of Losses
to the extent reasonably estimable (the " _Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that the failure of the Indemnified Party to provide timely notice shall
not result in the forfeiture of any rights of the Indemnified Party except to
the extent such failure results in the loss or waiver of substantive defenses
of the Indemnifying Party. 

(b) _Payment_. Upon an Indemnifying Partys receipt of a Notice pursuant to
_Section 10.06(a)_ above from an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party
shall be required to make payments to an Indemnified Party only in accordance
with the following procedures :

 

(i) if the Indemnifying Party is Buyer, pay all Losses specified in such
Notice that are payable pursuant to this  _Article X_, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, promptly after receipt of such Notice; _provided_
, _however_ , that if the Indemnifying Party in good faith disputes the Losses
specified in such Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall so notify the
Indemnified Party within 30 days of receipt of such Notice;

(ii) if the Indemnifying Parties are the Sellers, or any of them, and the
Sellers, or applicable Sellers, do not dispute the Losses specified in such
Notice, pay all Losses specified in such Notice that are payable pursuant to
this _Article X_ by agreeing that the amount of such Losses may be deducted
from the next payment of the Deferred Proceeds, it being understood that if
such dispute is with regard to a Notice that applies to only particular
Sellers pursuant to  _Section 10.02(b)_ or otherwise, such deduction shall
only be from the Deferred Proceeds payable to each such Seller and in the
amount not disputed by each such Seller;

 

(iii) if the Indemnifying Parties are the Sellers, or any of them, and the
Sellers, or applicable Sellers, in good faith dispute the Losses specified in
such Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall so notify the Indemnified Party
within 30 days of receipt of such Notice in which event the procedures set
forth below in _Section 10.06(c)_ and  _Section 10.06(d)_ below shall
apply; and

(iv) Except as specifically provided in  _Section 10.06(d)(ii)_ below,
Sellers shall individually be obligated to pay to the Buyer any amounts that
may be payable to Buyer pursuant to this _Article X_ in excess of the Deferred
Proceeds otherwise distributable to such Sellers, if any, only after all the
Deferred Proceeds otherwise distributable to such Sellers have been paid to
Buyer in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 10.06(b)(ii)_
above or _Section 10.06(c)_ and  _Section 10.06(d)_ below.

(c) _Disputes_. If there is a dispute as to any indemnification claim set
forth in a Notice pursuant to _Section 10.06(a)_ above, the Indemnifying
Party and Indemnified Party shall first attempt to resolve any such dispute
through good faith negotiations. In any event, the Indemnifying Party shall
pay to the Indemnified Party, as provided in _Section 10.06(b)_ above, the
amount of any Losses for which the Indemnifying Party is liable hereunder no
later than ten Business Days following any Final Determination of such Losses
and the Indemnifying Partys liability therefor. A " _Final Determination_ "
shall exist when (i) the parties to the dispute have

 



-60-  reached an agreement in writing that specifically acknowledged the
Indemnifying Partys liability and the amount of Losses for which it has
liability, (ii) a court of competent jurisdiction shall have entered a final
and non-appealable order or judgment, or (iii) an arbitration or like panel
shall have rendered a final non-appealable determination with respect to
disputes the parties have agreed to submit thereto;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that this _Section 10.06(c)_ shall not create or imply any right or
requirement to submit matters to arbitration, and the provisions of _Section
12.10_ below shall govern any disputes, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon
by the parties to such dispute.

(d) _Escrow Fund_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing _clause (c)_ , if (i) there is a dispute as
to any indemnification claim set forth in a Notice pursuant to _Section
10.06(a)_ above, (ii) the Indemnifying Party is the Sellers, or any of them,
and (iii) one or more installments of the Deferred Proceeds remain unpaid at
such time, then Buyer shall deposit an amount in cash equal to the amount of
Losses in controversy with respect to such dispute (or, in the event such
amount exceeds the unpaid portion of the Deferred Proceeds at such time, an
amount in cash equal to the amount of Deferred Proceeds remaining unpaid)
(each such amount deposited, an " _Escrow Amount_ ") into escrow with SunTrust
Bank, or such other bank or trust company selected by Buyer with
Securityholders Representatives prior approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), to be
held by the Escrow Agent until a Final Determination is made with respect to
such dispute and thereafter distributed by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agents standard form of escrow
agreement (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ").

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a dispute is with regard to a Notice
that applies to a particular Seller pursuant to  _Section 10.02(b)_, then
the amount deposited with the Escrow Agent of the Deferred Proceeds shall only
be from the Allocable Portion of Deferred Proceeds payable to such particular
Seller and shall be administered hereunder as a separate Escrow Amount (a "
_Separate Seller Escrow Amount_ ") applicable to only such Seller and the
particular claim or claims applicable to such Seller. If as a result of the
deposit of such Separate Seller Escrow Amount into escrow to satisfy any such
claim against a particular Seller, or the payment of any such amounts to Buyer
as provided below or in accordance with _Section 10.06(b)(ii)_ above, the
remaining amount of such Sellers Allocable Portion of Deferred Proceeds is
insufficient to cover such Sellers Allocable Portion of indemnifications
claims for which all Sellers are jointly and severally liable and which would
have otherwise been satisfied from the Deferred Proceeds but for the deposit
or payment of any Separate Seller Escrow Amount (or payment in accordance
with _Section 10.06(b)(ii)_ above), then such Seller shall be individually
liable to Buyer to the extent of such insufficiency.

 



-61- (iii) The Escrow Amounts (including all Separate Seller Escrow Amounts"), and
all interest and other direct or indirect earnings thereon after the Closing,
are collectively hereinafter referred to as the " _Indemnity Escrow Fund_."

 

(iv) In the event that as a result of a Final Determination, an Escrow Amount
(or some portion thereof) or a Separate Seller Escrow Amount is owed to the
Buyer Indemnified Parties (such amount owed, the " _Final Adjustment Amount_ "
and the difference between the Final Adjustment Amount and the Escrow Amount,
if any, the " _Remainder_ "), then within three Business Days of the Final
Determination, Buyer and Securityholders Representative shall execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written instruction directing the Escrow
Agent to release to Buyer the Final Adjustment Amount and the Remainder, if
any, shall be held by the Escrow Agent until such time as it is payable as
Deferred Proceeds hereunder, at which point Buyer and Securityholders
Representative shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written
instruction directing the Escrow Agent to release to Sellers the Remainder. In
such event, the Deferred Proceeds owed by Buyer hereunder shall be
automatically reduced by the Final Adjustment Amount with such reduction
applied first to the last Deferred Proceeds held in escrow that would have
been otherwise payable under this Agreement.

 

(v) In the event that as a result of a Final Determination, an Escrow Amount
(or some portion thereof) is not owed to the Buyer Indemnified Parties, then
within three Business Days of the Final Determination, Buyer and
Securityholders Representative shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a
joint written instruction directing the Escrow Agent to release to Sellers
the Final Adjustment Amount and the Remainder, if any, shall be held by the
Escrow Agent until such time as it is payable as Deferred Proceeds hereunder,
at which point Buyer and Securityholders Representative shall execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written instruction directing the Escrow
Agent to release to Sellers the Remainder. In such event, the Final Adjustment
Amount shall be treated as an advanced payment of the Deferred Proceeds owed
by Buyer hereunder and Buyers obligation to make future payments shall be
correspondingly reduced by the Final Adjustment Amount.

(vi) The Parties acknowledge that Buyer shall be treated as the owner of the
entire Indemnity Escrow Fund and shall be responsible for any Taxes
attributable to income earned in respect of the Indemnity Escrow Fund until
such time as the Indemnity Escrow Fund is disbursed in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. All cash included in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be held in an interest-bearing account in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and Buyer will receive from
the Indemnity Escrow Fund on a quarterly basis a distribution equal to the
amount of taxable income earned on the Indemnity Escrow Fund multiplied by the
highest marginal federal, state and local income tax rate applicable to Buyer
for purposes of Buyers payment of any Taxes attributable to income earned in
respect of the Indemnity Escrow Fund as further provided by the Escrow
Agreement.

 



-62- Section 10.07 _Survival of Claims_.

 

In the event notice of any claim for indemnification under _Section 10.02_
(Indemnification Provisions for Buyers Benefit) or  _Section 10.03_
(Indemnification Provisions for Sellers Benefit) is given pursuant to
_Section 10.04(a)_ or _Section 10.06(a)_ within the applicable survival
period, the cause of action that is the subject of such indemnification claim
shall survive until such time as such claim is finally resolved.

Section 10.08 _Mitigation_.

 

(a) With respect to each claim for indemnification, any Losses that may be
recovered by the Buyer Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties,
as applicable, with respect to such claim shall be net of any insurance
proceeds actually recovered by the Buyer Indemnified Parties or the Seller
Indemnified Parties, as applicable, with respect thereto (net of the out-of-
pocket costs reasonably incurred of pursuing or obtaining such insurance
proceeds, deductibles and any increased premium amounts attributable to such
claim). To the extent that insurance proceeds are collected by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, after a
claim has been settled, the Buyer Indemnified Parties or the Seller
Indemnified Parties, as applicable, shall restore the indemnifying party to
the same economic position as would have existed had such insurance proceeds
been collected prior to the settlement of such claim (net of the out-of-pocket
costs reasonably incurred of pursuing or obtaining such insurance proceeds,
deductibles and any increased premium amounts attributable to such claim).

(b) An Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Losses for which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Article X_.

(c) If an Indemnified Party realizes any net Tax benefit as a result of any
Loss for which the Indemnified Party is indemnified pursuant to this _Article
X_ , the Indemnified Party will promptly pay the amount of the net Tax benefit
(not in excess of the indemnification payment received by the Indemnified
Party pursuant to this  _Article X_ ) to the Indemnifying Party. For purposes
of the foregoing, net Tax benefit shall mean the present value (computed using
the rate of interest per annum announced by the _Wall Street Journal_ as the
"prime rate" at large U.S. money center banks as of five Business Days before
the date on which the amount of the net Tax benefit is to be paid) of any
refund of Taxes paid or reduction in the amount of Taxes which otherwise would
have been paid, net of any increase in Taxes paid by the Indemnified Party on
account of receipt of the indemnification payment, in each case computed at
the highest applicable marginal statutory tax rates.

 

Section 10.09 _Fraud Claims_.

 

Any and all fraud claims that may be made hereunder may only be brought
against an individual Seller with respect to his, her or its own fraud, and
no Seller shall have any liability for the fraud of any other Seller or third
party.

 



-63- Article XI

continue in full force and effect and the following provisions shall also
survive any such termination: _Section 6.04_ (Brokers Fees), _Section 8.12_

agrees that (i) it will not seek to disqualify Cooley LLP from acting and

representation of the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated
herein; and (ii) the Sellers have a reasonable expectation of privacy with
respect to their communications (including any e-mail communications using

transactions contemplated hereby (" _Protected Communications_ ") shall be
deemed privileged communications of the Sellers for the purposes of such
claims or disputes, and to the extent that they may not be considered as such
at law, the parties hereto agree to contractually treat such Protected

herein by reference and made a part hereof.

(a) Each Seller hereby irrevocably designates and appoints Pro-Edge, LP. as,
and Pro-Edge, LP. hereby irrevocably accepts the designation as and agrees to
be, the representative of each Seller and the "Securityholders Representative"
for purposes of this Agreement. The Securityholders Representative is hereby
designated as the attorney in fact and agent for and on behalf of each Seller
and his, her or its respective heirs, successors and assigns with respect to
the exercise of the power to take all actions and make all decisions on behalf
of each Seller under this Agreement and any other document or agreement
delivered in connection herewith, including without limitation, decisions and
actions with respect to payments and adjustments under _Article II_ , with
respect to satisfaction and waiver of closing conditions under _Article IX_ ,
and with respect to claims for indemnification under _Article X_. The
Securityholders Representative also shall have the power to give and receive
all notices and communications to be given or received by the Sellers, or any
of them, under this Agreement and to receive service of process for the
Sellers, or any of them, in connection with any claims under this Agreement
and to take all actions on behalf of the Sellers, or any of them, necessary to
settle, pay or take any other actions with respect to the Sellers or any
Sellers indemnification obligations under _Article X_. Each Seller shall be
bound by all actions taken and documents executed by the Securityholders
Representative in connection with this Agreement. Notices or communications
to or from the Securityholders Representative shall constitute notice to or
from each Seller. In performing the functions specified in this Agreement, the
Securityholders Representative may act upon any instrument or other
writing believed by the Securityholders Representative in good faith to be
genuine and to be signed or presented by the proper Person and shall not be
liable in connection with the performance by it of its duties pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement. The Securityholders Representative shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Sellers, jointly and severally, and in
accordance with each Sellers Allocable Portion, from and against any Losses
incurred on the part of the Securityholders Representative and arising out of
or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties
hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Securityholders Representative shall have full power and authority to
interpret all the terms and provisions of this Agreement on behalf of all
Sellers and their respective heirs, successors and assigns.

 

(b) This power of attorney granted by each Seller to the Securityholders
Representative is coupled with an interest and all authority hereby conferred
is granted and shall be irrevocable and shall not be terminated or affected by
subsequent disability or incapacity of any Seller or by any act of any Seller
or by operation of law, whether by such persons death,
disability, protective supervision or any other event. Each Seller shall be
deemed to have waived any and all defenses that may be available to contest,
negate or disaffirm the action of the Securityholders Representative taken in
good faith under this Agreement or any document or agreement delivered in
connection herewith. Notwithstanding the power of attorney granted in this
_Section 12.15_, no agreement, instrument, acknowledgement or other act or
document shall be ineffective solely by reason of a Seller (instead of the
Securityholders Representative) having signed or given the same directly.

 



-69- (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in
any other agreement executed in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement: (i) Buyer shall be entitled to deal exclusively with
Securityholders Representative on all matters including, but not limited to,
matters relating to any claim for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement hereunder; and (ii) Buyer shall be entitled to rely conclusively
(without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or
purported to be executed on behalf of Sellers by Securityholders
Representative, and on any other action taken or purported to be taken on
behalf of Sellers by Securityholders Representative, as fully binding upon
Sellers. A decision, act, consent or instruction of
Securityholders Representative, including an amendment, extension, waiver or
termination of this Agreement, shall constitute a decision of Sellers and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon Sellers; and Buyer may rely upon
any such decision, act, consent or instruction of Securityholders
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of Sellers.
Buyer is hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by
it in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of
Securityholders Representative.

Section 12.16 _Non-Disclosure Agreement_.

 

The Non-Disclosure Agreement is incorporated into this Agreement by reference
in its entirety and shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing
at which time it shall terminate. If this Agreement is not consummated for
whatever reason, the Non-Disclosure Agreement shall nonetheless continue in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 

Section 12.17 _Specific Performance_.

 

The Parties acknowledge that their obligations hereunder are unique and that
remedies at law, including monetary damages, will be inadequate in the event
any Party should default in the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement. Accordingly, in the event of any such breach, the non-defaulting
party or parties shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief (if the court
so grants), including in the form of an injunction or injunctions or orders
for specific performance to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to order
the defaulting party to affirmatively carry out its obligations under this
Agreement.

 

Section 12.18 _Waiver of Certain Rights_.

 

Each Seller hereby waives any and all rights of first refusal, rights of first
offer or other transfer rights such Seller may have under the Companys
Corporate Documents or otherwise in connection with the sale of the
Transferred Interests to Buyer and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.
