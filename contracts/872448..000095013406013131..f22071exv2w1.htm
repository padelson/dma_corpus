       | (ii)  |   | Should the amount of Net Working Capital
immediately after the Closing be more than the Target NWC, the Purchaser
shall owe the difference to the Seller.  
---|---|---|---

July 31, 2006 and the Target NWC of 14,672,000 Euros is hereby called the
"Final NWC Adjustment".  
---|---|---

Net Working Capital as of 31 July 2006 ("the Provisional NWC"), in accordance
with its normal accounting procedures and submit such calculation to the
Seller no later than 15 September 2006\. This calculation shall use the same
format, the same assumptions and the same list of accounts as those used in

The NWC Adjustment that would be completed should the Provisional NWC be

Closing is hereafter referred to as the "Provisional NWC Adjustment".  
      
  (c)  |   | Should either Party so request by written notice to the other

Provisional NWC Adjustment, the Parties mutually agree to implement the
verification and adjustment procedure stated in (e) through (i) below.
If during the course of such verification and adjustment procedure the
Parties shall agree the Provisional NWC Adjustment (or any final changes to
it) then the Provisional NWC Adjustment (as amended) shall be deemed to be
the Final NWC Adjustment. If neither Party serves written notice by 30
September under this clause, the Provisional NWC Adjustment shall be deemed to
be agreed as the Final NWC Adjustment.  
      
  (d)  |   | The Purchaser will provide the Seller and their
representatives with access to all information and personnel necessary for
the Seller to review all calculations as of the Closing Date and the
determination of the NWC Adjustment.  
      
  (e)  |   | The two Chief Financial Officers, namely Michael Hannant of
the Purchaser and Robert Avery of the Seller shall discuss and agree on the
Final NWC Adjustment no later than 15 October 2006. Should they not agree by
that date (or such later date as the Parties shall agree), then either Party
may so notify the other Party in writing and submit to the other Party a
written statement (the "Dispute Notice") setting forth any good faith
objections that such Party may have to draft Final NWC Adjustment, together
with any supporting documentation of such objections.  
      
  (f)  |   | If within a further period of 15 days (or such later date as
the Parties shall agree), the Parties cannot reach agreement, such dispute
shall be submitted for resolution to Deloitte (the "Independent Accounting
Firm"). If Deloitte notifies either of the parties that it is unwilling or
unable to act as the Independent Accounting Firm for any reason
(which determination shall be deemed to have been made by Deloitte if within
ten (10) days after it has been first requested to so act by one of the
parties, it has not notified the parties that it is willing and able to act
as the Independent Accounting Firm), and in the absence of any agreement
between the Seller and the Purchaser as to

       |   | the identity of another Independent Accounting Firm, the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be appointed among highly reputed
accountancy firms by the President of the _Tribunal de Commerce de Paris_
acting in summary proceedings ( _statuant comme en mati ere de refere_) upon
request of the most diligent party, with each party having the opportunity to
be heard, which decision shall be final and binding on the parties and may
not be challenged on appeal.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (g)  |   | In resolving any disputed item, the Independent
Accounting Firm (i) shall be bound by the provisions of this Article 2.3,
(ii) shall limit its review to matters still in dispute as specifically set
forth in the Dispute Notice (and only to the extent such matters are still
in dispute following such 30-day period) and (iii) shall further limit its
review solely to whether the Provisional NWC Adjustment has been prepared in
accordance with this Article 2.3. The determination of any item that is a
component of the NWC Adjustment and is the subject of a dispute cannot,
however, be in excess of, or less than, the greatest or lowest
value, respectively, claimed for any particular item in the draft Final NWC
Adjustment or the Dispute Notice (or, if different, the value claimed by the
relevant party at the end of such 30-day period). The Seller and the
Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Independent
Accounting Firm to render a decision resolving the matters in dispute within
30 days following the submission of such matters to the Independent
Accounting Firm.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (h)  |   | Except as specified in the following sentence, the cost
of any dispute resolution procedure (including the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm) pursuant to this Article 2.3 shall be borne, in
its entirety, by the party whose calculation of the Final NWC Adjustment as
initially submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm is furthest away from
the NWC Adjustment as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm. The fees
and expenses of the Purchasers independent auditors, if any, incurred in
connection with the issuance of the Final NWC Adjustment shall be borne by
the Purchaser, and the fees and expenses of the independent auditors, if any,
of the Seller, incurred in connection with their review of the Final NWC
Adjustment shall be borne by the Seller. The written decision of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall, save only in the event of manifest error (
_erreur manifeste_ ) be final, binding and conclusive on the Seller and the
Purchaser.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | The Independent Accounting Firm shall act in accordance with
the provisions of Article 1592 of the French Civil Code.  
   

  

     (i)  |   | In the event that the Net Working Capital as determined
in the Final NWC Adjustment is more than 150,000 greater than 14,672,000
Euros ("Target NWC") then the Purchaser shall pay the difference (including
the 150,000) to the Seller. In the event that the Net Working Capital as
determined in the Final NWC Adjustment is more than 150,000 less than
Target NWC then the Seller shall pay the difference (including the 150,000)
to the Purchaser.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (j)  |   | Any payment from one party to the other under this
clause 2.3 shall (i) be paid within five (5) business days of the date of
agreement between the Parties or the date the determination of the Final NWC
Adjustment is delivered to both Parties by the Independent Accounting
Firm; and (ii) shall be paid in Euros.

  6.  |   | FUTURE COVENANTS  
      
  6.1  |   | _Third Party Consents_   
      
    |   | The Parties acknowledge that they have already approached
certain key suppliers of the Company in order to obtain their consent to the
sale of the Shares hereunder to the Purchaser. The Seller agrees to uses its
best efforts between the Date of this Agreement and the Closing, and after
the Closing if necessary, and the Purchaser agrees to cooperate fully in that
process, in order to obtain all necessary consents from third parties in
connection with the transaction contemplated hereby with respect to the
Contracts to which the Company is a party.  
      
  6.2  |   | _Change of Name of the Company_   
      
    |   | The Purchaser agrees that as from the Closing, it shall not
use, and shall take all steps required to prevent the Company from using the
name "Atmel" or "Atmel Grenoble" or any other derivative of the name Atmel or
the logo of Atmel for any reason whatsoever.  
      
    |   | Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, the Parties recognize
that it is impractical to change all of the product identifications,
packaging and promotional materials as of the Closing Date. The Seller agrees
that the Company may continue to utilize and exhaust the current stock of
such materials produced or in production, provided that it immediately
takes steps to create new materials eliminating the "Atmel" name, and the
Purchaser shall ensure that the Company takes such action as quickly as
possible.  
      
  6.3  |   | _Intellectual Property Rights_

the past five years as part of the Atmel Corporation and its Affiliates, with
a view toward cooperating in the design and development of Intellectual
Property Rights, applications, technologies, and products, in whole or in
part. During this time, parties have not attempted to define precisely which
of the Affiliates of Atmel Corporation should be declared as the owner of
Developed Technology and Developed Intellectual Property Rights. With the
sale of the Shares of the Company hereunder, the parties recognize the need
to define as follows who owns Intellectual Property Rights in such Developed
Technology and Developed Intellectual Property Rights.  
      
    |   | To that end, the Parties acknowledge and agree that to the
extent the Company has created Developed Technology and Developed
Intellectual Property Rights, unless otherwise provided in any of the
Transition Services Agreements, the following rules shall apply in the
following descending order to determine the ownership and such items shall be
deemed to be owned by:  
      
    |   | (i) the Company if the Developed Technology and Developed
Intellectual Property Rights are predominantly used by Company and not by the
Seller and/or its Affiliates or  
   

   #####

    |   | (iii) Any Developed Technology or Developed Intellectual
Property Rights that have been primarily developed by a party shall be
exclusively owned by such party, notwithstanding any inputs and suggestions
that the other party may have made in regard to such work and deliverables.  
      
  (b)  |   | _Ownership of Existing Technology and Existing Intellectual
Property Rights_   
      
    |   | The Parties agree that as between the Seller and/or its

its Affiliates and all Intellectual Property Rights therein are and shall be
owned by, and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the Seller
and/or its Affiliates. Except as and to the extent otherwise provided in this
Agreement this Agreement shall not give either the Seller and/or its
Affiliates or the Company any ownership interest in or right to any Existing
Technology or Existing Intellectual Property Rights held by the other party.  
      
  (c)  |   | _Licenses _  
      
    |   | (i) _By the Company_ : The Company hereby grants to the Seller
and/or its Affiliates a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-
free, with no right to sublicense license to use the Developed Technology and
Developed Intellectual Property Rights that are owned and licensable by the
Company and to make, use, have used, lease, offer to sell, sell or otherwise
transfer any product or related Technology and to practice and have practiced
any method in support of these rights.  
      
    |   | (ii) _By the Seller_ : The Seller hereby grants, and shall
procure that its Affiliates grant, to the Company a worldwide, non-exclusive,

have used, lease, offer to sell, sell or otherwise transfer any product or
related Technology and to practice and have practiced any method in support
of these rights,  

 It being agreed that:  
      
    |   | (i) any change of control of the Purchaser or the Company to
the benefit of a competitor of the Seller within seven (7) years from the
Closing Date would constitute a transfer, thus terminating any outstanding
license in favor of the Company, except in case of mutual consent of the
Parties, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.  
      
    |   | (ii) any change of control of the Seller to the benefit of a
competitor of the Company within seven (7) years from the Closing Date would

required and, if the Seller so requests, the Seller may commission at its own
expense a second assessment. The Purchaser is at liberty to ask that
additional remedial action be taken at the same time, at its or the Companys
own expense. In case of disagreement between the parties as to the
determination of such remedial actions strictly required by Law, such

---|---|---|--- 
   

   

In the event that after the Closing (i) any claim, demand or Proceeding is
asserted or instituted by any Person (including a Governmental Authority)
other than the parties hereto (a " _Third Party_ ") which, if successful,
could give rise to Losses for which an Indemnifying Party would be liable to
an Indemnified Party hereunder (any such claim, demand or Proceeding, a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), or (ii) any Indemnified Party hereunder shall have a
claim to be indemnified by any Indemnifying Party hereunder which does not
involve a Third Party Claim (any such claim, a " _Direct Claim_ "), the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party a written notice (a
" _Claim Notice_ ") specifying in reasonable detail, to the extent known to
the Indemnified Party, the factual basis of such Third Party Claim or Direct
Claim and the amount or estimated amount of related Losses (which estimate
shall not be conclusive of the final amount thereof) and such
available supporting evidence as may reasonably be required by the
Indemnifying Party to assess the merits of the Third Party Claim or Direct
Claim and the computation or estimate of Losses.

For the avoidance of doubt, any notice of Tax audit or official request from
Tax Governmental Authorities to receive communication of specific documents
to the Company which does not constitute a current claim or demand but which
could give rise to a future Third Party Claim hereunder shall be included in
the definition of a Third Party Claim, requiring the Purchaser to notify the
Seller in the same manner as stated in this Article. 

   

(ii) Time for Claim Notice. 

   

Either Party as an Indemnified Party shall send a Claim Notice: (i) in the
case of a Third Party Claim, by no later than fifteen (15) days after its
receipt of actual notice of such Third Party Claim, or within a shorter
period in view of circumstances; and (ii) in the case of a Direct Claim, with
reasonable promptness in view of the circumstances  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that a failure by the Indemnified Party to comply with such notice periods
shall have no consequences on its ability to make a claim under
this Agreement, and shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability
that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party demonstrates that such failure has caused the Losses for
which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to the Indemnified Party to exceed
the amount that such Losses would have been had the Indemnified Party given
timely notice, in which event the Losses for which the Indemnifying Party is
liable to the Indemnified Party shall be reduced by the amount of any such
excess. 

   

b) _Direct Claim_  

   

In the event of a Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30)
days following its receipt of the relevant Claim Notice (the " _Direct Claim
Review Period_ ") to make such investigation of the corresponding claim as it
considers necessary or desirable. If the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party agree, on or prior to the expiration of the Direct Claim
Review Period, upon the validity and amount of such claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party, within ten (10) days
following the date of such agreement, the full agreed amount of such claim.
If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party fail to agree on or prior
to the date of the expiration of the Direct Claim Review Period upon the
validity or the amount of the Direct Claim, or if the Indemnifying Party
notifies the Indemnified Party during the Direct Claim Review Period that it
disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party in respect of the
corresponding claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to initiate
proceedings against the Indemnifying Party in accordance with Article 8.10.
If the Indemnifying Party fails to so notify the Indemnified Party during the
Direct Claim Review Period that it disputes its liability to the Indemnified
Party in respect of the relevant Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party
shall be deemed to have refused its liability to the Indemnified Party in
respect of such Direct Claim. 

   

c) _Third Party Claim_  

   

(i) Third Party Claim Review Period 

   

In the event of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty
(30) days following its receipt of the relevant Claim Notice (the " _Third
Party Claim Review Period_ ") to make such investigation of the underlying
claim as it considers necessary or desirable and to notify the Indemnified
Party whether or not it disputes 

   ##### 

  

  

EXECUTION COPY 
 Page 28 of 37 

    

its liability to the Indemnified Party in respect of such Third Party Claim
(which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
objection). If the Indemnifying Party so notifies the Indemnified Party
during the Third Party Claim Review Period that it disputes its liability to
the Indemnified Party in respect of the relevant Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to initiate proceedings against
the Indemnifying Party in accordance with Article 8.10. If the Indemnifying
Party fails to so notify the Indemnified Party during the Third Party Claim
Review Period that it disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party in
respect of the relevant Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be
deemed to have refused its liability to the Indemnified Party in respect of
such Third Party Claim. 

   

(ii) Defense of Third Party Claim 

   

Until such time, if any, as it is determined or agreed that the Indemnifying
Party has no liability to the Indemnified Party in respect of a particular
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, or shall cause the Company
to, conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim in good faith using all
reasonable means and defenses available to it or to the Company (having due
regard for the interests of the Company). The Indemnifying Party shall have
the right, if it so notifies the Indemnified Party with reasonable promptness
after receipt of the Claim Notice, (a) to be consulted in respect of such
Third Party Claim and to participate at its own expense and with counsel of
its choice in the defense thereof by the Indemnified Party (or in the case of
a Third Party Claim against the Company, by the Company), (b) to take charge,
at its own expense, of the defense of the Company, either alone or alongside
counsel chosen by the Company, with the consent of the Company, which can
only be refused if the Company in good faith believes that such defense by
the Indemnifying Party would not be in the best interests of the Company.
Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

   

In any event, the Indemnified Party shall afford the Indemnifying Party and
its counsel the opportunity to comment and the right to object (which right
shall not be unreasonably exercised) with respect to the conduct of the
defense of the Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall keep the
Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of the progress of any Third Party
Claim and its defense, and shall with reasonable promptness provide
the Indemnifying Party with copies of all material notices, written
communications and filings (including court papers) made by or on behalf of
any of the parties to the Third Party Claim. A failure by the Indemnified
Party to so take into account any reasonable suggestions or objections made
by the Indemnifying Party shall have as its consequence that the Indemnifying
Party shall not be responsible for any Losses resulting from such Third Party
Claim to the extent that the Indemnifying Party can demonstrate that such
Losses could have been avoided or limited had the suggestions or objections
of the Indemnifying Party been followed. 

   

(iii) Settlement of Third Party Claims 

   

The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any Third Party Claim settled
or otherwise compromised without its prior written consent. In such
connection, if the Indemnified Party (or the Company, if the Purchaser is the
Indemnifying Party) shall receive from a Third Party or if the Indemnified
Party shall propose to make to a Third Party an offer to compromise or settle
such Third Party Claim (a " _Settlement_  

   ##### 

  

  

EXECUTION COPY 
 Page 29 of 37 

    

 _Offer_ "), the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of
such Settlement Offer with reasonable promptness following receipt thereof
from the Third Party and reasonably in advance of responding thereto, or
reasonably in advance of making such Settlement Offer, and shall provide with
such notice all related supporting documentation reasonably required to
enable the Indemnifying Party to assess the relative merits of the Settlement
Offer. At the request of either of the parties, the parties will consult
in good faith with respect to any such Settlement Offer. The Indemnifying
Party shall then determine in the exercise of its business judgment whether
or not to consent to the Settlement Offer, but shall not unreasonably
withhold or delay any such consent (with such consent being deemed refused if
the Indemnifying Party shall not have responded in writing within thirty (30)
days (or such shorter period as may be reasonable under the circumstances) of
its receipt of a request for consent). 

   

If a Settlement Offer is received (for which the sole relief provided is
monetary damages), which the Indemnifying Party, but not the Indemnified
Party, is willing to accept, the Indemnified Party may elect to continue the
defense of the Third Party Claim at its own expense, in which case the
liability of the Indemnifying Party shall be limited to the lesser of: (x)
Losses calculated as if the Third Party Claim were settled in accordance with
the proposed Settlement Offer, and (y) the Losses actually suffered by the
Indemnified Party taking into account the final resolution of the Third Party
Claim. 

  

       | d)  |   | _Cooperation_   
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice, at
the reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall
grant the Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors reasonable access
to the books, records and properties of the Indemnified Party (or of the
Company, if the Seller is the Indemnifying Party) to the extent reasonably
related to the matters to which the Claim Notice relates. The Indemnifying
Party will not, and shall require that its professional advisors do not, use
(except in connection with such Claim Notice and the defense of any related
Third Party Claim) or disclose to any third party other than the Indemnifying
Partys professional advisors any information obtained pursuant to this
Article 7.5.d) which is designated as confidential by the Indemnified Party
(or by the Company, as the case may be). All such access shall be granted
during normal business hours, and shall be granted under conditions which
will not interfere with the business and operations of the Indemnified Party
(and/or the Company, as the case may be).  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | In addition to (i) above, to the extent that any Claim
Notice involves any calculation of Tax liabilities due by any Party, the
other Party shall fully cooperate with the Party preparing the defense of its
tax position, and make all Tax files in its possession or in the possession
of the Company available to the other Party.

       | e)  |   | _Dates of payment of the indemnification_   
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | In the event of a Third Party Claim, as provided
in section 7.5 c), any indemnification due by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party as a result of a Loss incurred following a Proceeding shall
be due from the date the Indemnified Party will be required to pay to the
Third Party, the sums corresponding to the Loss as a result of an enforceable
( _ex ecutoire_) judicial or arbitral decision irrespective of whether such
decision is appealable or not, or as a result of a settlement with such Third
Party.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | In the event of Direct Claim by the Indemnifying
Party:  
   

  

       |   |   | any indemnification owed by the Indemnifying Party
to the Indemnified Party shall be due, if the Parties agree on the merit and
the amount of the indemnification within the time period provided in section
7.5 b), from the date of such agreement; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    |   |   | any indemnification owed by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party shall be due, if the Parties fail to agree within the time
period provided in section 7.5 b), from the date of the enforceable ( _ex
ecutoire_) judicial or arbitral decision settling their disagreement
irrespective of whether such decision is appealable or not.  
   

  

       | (iii)  |   | If following the payment of an indemnification,
a judicial decision reduces or cancels all or part of the amount of such
indemnification paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall forthwith repay to the Indemnifying Party the excess
sums so received. Conversely, if following the payment of an indemnification,
a judicial decision increases all or part of the amount of
such indemnification paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party,
the Indemnifying Party shall forthwith pay to the Indemnified Party such
surplus.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (iv)  |   | Any indemnification owed by the Indemnifying Party
shall be paid to the Indemnified Party within ten (10) days following the
date it becomes due in accordance with this section.  
   

  

       | f)  |   | _Calculation of Losses._   
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | The amount of any Loss imposed on, sustained,
incurred or suffered by an Indemnified Party shall be:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (1)  |   | reduced by the amount of any insurance
proceeds, or any other amount actually paid to the Company on account of
the specific matter in question, as the case may be with respect to
any Loss, net of any costs incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining
or collecting such proceeds or amounts, it being agreed that the Indemnified
Party shall use its best efforts to obtain such proceeds and other amounts;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (2)  |   | reduced by any benefit consisting of an
actual reduction in Taxes resulting from such Loss for the Indemnified Party
;  
      
    | (3)  |   | reduced by the amount of any provisions indicated in
the 2005 Financials (whether subject to reversal or not), to the extent
that  
    

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

EXECUTION COPY 
 Page 31 of 37 

   

       |   |   | such provision was specifically booked in
connection with the fact or events having generated such Loss;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (4)  |   | reduced by the portion of such Loss that was caused by
any act or omission of the Purchaser or the Company, occurring after the
Closing, where the Purchaser or the Company knew or ought reasonably to have
known that such act or omission would increase any Loss, provided that it
shall not apply to such act or omission which are: (i) taken in the ordinary
course of the Companys business, (ii) required to be taken to ensure
compliance with Law, or (iii) required to comply with preexisting contractual
obligations of the Company;  
   

  

       |   |   | (hereafter the "Net Loss")  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | The amount of the indemnity payable to an Indemnified
Party (hereafter the "Indemnification Amount" _)_ shall be equal to:  
   

  

       | (1)  |   | the total amount of the Net Loss for any
Loss referred to in Sections 7.3 and 7.4 above; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (2)  |   | increased by the amount of any Taxes (including the
reduction of any tax loss carry forward multiplied by the applicable tax
rate) expressly due by the Company as an Indemnified Party as a result of the
indemnification being received by it in accordance with applicable Tax laws
as interpreted by the French Council of State ("Conseil dEtat"). In this
manner, the net Indemnification Amount received by the Company as an
Indemnified Party after payment of Taxes is equal to the Net Loss.  
   

  

       | (iii)  |   | Limitations  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (1)  |   | No indemnification shall be payable unless
the aggregate amount of the corresponding Net Loss is greater than
EUR 15,000. A series of Losses having the same cause or origin will
be deemed to constitute one single Loss for purpose of determining
whether the above amount has been exceeded. Such limitation shall not apply
to indemnification relating to (a) Laikko case referred to in Section 7.4(a)
above, (b) FingerChip referred to in Section 7.4(b) above, (c) storage tanks
referred to in Section 7.4(c) above, (d) loans referred to in Section 7.4(d)
above, (e) absence of Debt referred to in Section 7.4(e) above (f) Cadence
licenses referred to in Section 7.4(f) above, and (g) breach of
representations made under Section 7.1(i) (Tax matters).  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (2)  |   | No indemnification shall be payable unless and until
the aggregate amount of Net Losses of claims giving rise to indemnification
in favor of the party claiming indemnification exceeds EUR 1,000,000 as
threshold (the "Threshold"). If the aggregate amount of Net Losses of claims
giving rise to indemnification exceeds the Threshold, the entire amount of
Net Losses of such claims, including the Threshold, shall give right to
indemnification. Such limitation shall not apply to

       |   |   | indemnification relating to (a) Laikko case
referred to in Section 7.4 (a) above, (b) FingerChip referred to in Section
7.4 (b) above, (c) storage tanks referred to in Section 7.4(c) above, (d)
loans referred to in Section 7.4(d) above, (e) absence of Debt referred to in
Section 7.4(e) above, (f) Cadence licenses referred to in Section 7.4(f)
above and (g) breach of representations made under Section 7.1(i)
(Tax matters).  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (3)  |   | The total aggregate amount of Net Losses of claims
giving rise to indemnification due by either party to the other Party shall
not exceed EUR 20,000,000 (the "Cap"). Such limitation shall not apply to
indemnification relating to (a) Laikko case referred to in Section 7.4 (a)
above, (b) FingerChip referred to in Section 7.4 (b) above, (c) storage tanks
referred to in Section 7.4(c) above, (d) loans referred to in Section 7.4(d)
above, (e) absence of Debt referred to in Section 7.4(e) above, (f) Cadence
licenses referred to in Section 7.4(f) above and (g) breach of
representations made under Section 7.1(i) (Tax matters) and none of such
indemnities shall be taken into account to determine whether this maximum
amount has been reached with respect to any other matters.  
      
    | (4)  |   | Any claim for indemnification under this Article must
be made in writing no more than twenty-one (21) months as from the date of
the Closing, failing which the right to make any such claim is hereby waived,
except that (i) the right to make a Claim in respect of the matters set forth
in Article 7.1.i) (Tax Matters) shall survive until the expiration of the
last day of the period ending thirty (30) days following the end of the
statute of limitations ( _la dur ee de la prescription legale_) applicable to
any Loss for Taxes, and (ii) the right to make a Claim in respect of the
ownership of the Shares by the Seller must be made in writing no more than
five (5) years as from the date of the Closing.  
      
    |   |   | If at any time prior to the relevant expiration date
specified above, a Claim Notice is delivered in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, the corresponding claim shall survive until such time as
it is fully and finally resolved.  
      
    | (5)  |   | A tax assessment resulting in a mere transfer
of charge from a fiscal year to another or not resulting in a final
charge shall not be taken into account for the calculation of
the indemnification, it being understood that, in such case, the
resulting financing costs, late interests and penalties, if any, shall be
taken into account.  
      
    | (6)  |   | Any amount owing to an Indemnified Party under this
Article 7.5 shall be paid in Euros.  
      
    | (7)  |   | The Purchaser shall retain its right to have
the Company indemnified or, as the case may be, to benefit from a
repayment of a portion of the Purchase Price pursuant to the provisions of
this Article 7.5, notwithstanding any sale, transfer or other disposition
of all or a part of the Shares after the date hereof, as if

       |   |   | it had at all times retained ownership of all the
Shares.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (8)  |   | The fact that the Purchaser has conducted a
due diligence investigation and that certain information about the
Company has been disclosed to the Purchaser prior to the Closing shall
not preclude its right to indemnification for Losses hereunder.  
   

  

       | (iv)  |   | Exemptions  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    |   |   | The obligations of the Seller pursuant to this Article
7.5 are the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser against the Seller for
any breach (or inaccuracy) in any representation or warranty included in
Article 7.1 and the Purchaser undertakes to exercise no action or recourse
under applicable Laws or under any stipulation other that the recourse
expressly set forth in this Agreement in this respect.  
      
    | (v)  |   | Duty to mitigate  
      
    |   |   | The Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable
endeavours and shall procure that the Company use its commercially reasonable
endeavours, to mitigate any Losses resulting from or arising out of any
matters giving rise to a claim under this Article 7.  
   

  

     8.  |   | GENERAL PROVISIONS  
---|---|--- 
      
  8.1  |   | _Confidentiality_   
      
    |   | The parties undertake to keep confidential the existence and
the terms of this Agreement, as well as all confidential business information
and documents that have been or will be exchanged in connection with the
Sale, including any and all reports prepared in connection therewith.  
      
    |   | Notwithstanding the foregoing, this undertaking shall not apply
to documents and information which must be disclosed in relation to judicial
or arbitral proceedings or pursuant to any Law.  
      
    |   | Neither party shall issue any press release or announcement
concerning negotiations in progress or the sale and purchase of the Shares
without the prior written consent of the other party.  
      
  8.2  |   | _Entire agreement_   
      
    |   | This Agreement and any other agreement or document executed by
the Parties and relating to the subject matter of this Agreement constitute
the entire and only agreements between the parties pertaining to the subject
matter hereof. Any and all prior drafts, agreements, or any other prior
understandings related to the subject matter hereof, whether written or oral,
are null and void.  
      
  8.3  |   | _Amendments_   
      
    |   | Any amendment, renewal or extension of this Agreement to be
effective must be in writing and executed by both parties.  
      
  8.4  |   | _Waiver_   
      
    |   | Failure by either party to exercise any of its rights under
this Agreement shall not be  
   

  #####

       |   | construed as a waiver of any such rights. Waiver by
either party of any right hereunder shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any
other right hereof.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Waiver by either party of any right hereunder shall be made in
writing and shall be notified to the other party.  
      
  8.5  |   | _Validity; Severability_   
      
    |   | If any provision/or any part thereof of this Agreement is
determined or held to be void, invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such
determination or holding shall in no way affect the remaining provisions of
this Agreement and the Agreement will be performed as if such provision had
never existed, provided, however, that such modification shall not impair
the balance between the rights and obligations of the parties and that the
relevant provision was not an essential condition to the consent of either
party.  
      
    |   | Furthermore, the parties agree to replace, to the greatest
extent legally possible, any unenforceable provision with a valid provision
having the same effect and embodying the Parties initial intent to the
greatest possible extent.  
      
  8.6  |   | _Successors; Assignment_   
      
    |   | This Agreement shall be binding on each party and its
successors and permitted assigns. Neither party may assign all or part of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other party, except that the Purchaser shall have the right to assign
all (but not some) of its rights and obligations hereunder to an Affiliate
wholly-owned by the Purchaser or its Affiliates, without relieving the
Purchaser of its obligations hereunder, provided that such Affiliate accepts
in writing all such obligations. The assignment of all or part of this
Agreement shall not release the assigning party from those obligations for
which it is jointly and severally liable with the assignee. The assignment of
all or part of this Agreement in violation of this Article shall be deemed to
be null and void _ab initio_.

other proceeding. Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives
and agrees not to assert by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise any
claims that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of the above courts, that
such action or suit is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of
such action, suit or other proceeding is improper. Each Party also agrees
that any final and unappealable judgment against such Party in connection
with any action, suit or other proceeding shall be conclusive and binding
on such Party and that such award or judgment may be enforced in any court of
competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of the United States. A

foregoing, each Party agrees that service of process on such party by both
facsimile transmission and certified mail to the addresses and addressees
set forth in Section 8.7 shall be deemed effective service of process on such
party.
