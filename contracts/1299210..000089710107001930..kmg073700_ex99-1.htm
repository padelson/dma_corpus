LOUISVILLE, Kentucky  September 7, 2007  Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today

Corporation ("KMG") (NYSE: KMA), a group and voluntary insurance benefits and

premium of approximately 36 percent over the average closing price of KMG

approximately $187.7 million (including estimated assumed debt of
approximately $50 million) will be financed through a combination of cash and

KMG offers life and health insurance products and services to approximately
1.1 million group and individual members nationwide, including stand-alone
stop-loss insurance through group employers for approximately 473,000 members

approximately 131,000 self-insured members. KMGs revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2006 approximated $181 million.

"KMGs capabilities in voluntary products will complement our major medical
offerings in both the employer group and individual product lines," said
Michael B. McCallister, Humanas president and chief executive officer. "In
addition, KMGs approach to both marketing and product distribution fit well
with Humanas focus on the consumer. We are looking forward to having KMG as
part of our organization."

  



  

"KMG America has managed a rigorous strategic alternative review process and
could not be more excited about joining the Humana family of companies," said
Kenneth U. Kuk, chairman of the board, president, and chief executive officer
of KMG. "Our shareholders, producers, and associates will benefit from this
affiliation. I feel we have accomplished the objectives we stated when we
announced this effort in May 2007."

  



  

The transaction is not expected to impact Humanas guidance for 2007 diluted
earnings per common share, with accretion of $0.04 to $0.05 per share expected
in 2008.

  



  

The transaction was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of Humana
and KMG. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including
the approval by KMG shareholders and the receipt of governmental and
regulatory approvals, including the approval of the South Carolina Department
of Insurance, and the expiration of all waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-

 _KMG America Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements_

  

Certain statements in this news release are forward-looking as defined by the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include statements as
to the expected timing, completion and effects of the proposed merger. Such
forward-looking statements are based on facts and conditions as they exist at
the time such statements are made as well as predictions as to future facts
and conditions the accurate prediction of which may be difficult and involve
the assessment of events beyond the control of KMG America. Due to known and
unknown risks, actual results may differ materially from expectations or
projections. KMG America does not undertake any obligations to update any
forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, relating to matters
discussed in this news release.

  



  

The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ
materially from those described in the forward-looking statements: the
shareholders of KMG America may not approve and adopt the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement at the special
shareholders meeting; the parties may be unable to obtain governmental and
regulatory approvals required for the merger; required governmental or
regulatory approvals may delay the merger or result in the imposition of
conditions that could cause the parties to abandon the merger; the parties may
be unable to complete the merger because, among other reasons, conditions to
the closing of the merger may not be satisfied or waived; or other factors
that may be referred to in KMG Americas reports filed with or furnished to
the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. There can be no 
assurance that other factors not currently anticipated by KMG America will not
materially and adversely affect future events. Viewers of this news release
are cautioned to consider these risks and uncertainties and not to place undue
reliance on the forward-looking statements.
