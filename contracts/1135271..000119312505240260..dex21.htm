Article 3.

_Conversion of Securities; Exchange of Certificates_



_Section 3.1_ _ _Conversion of Securities__. __ At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub,
the Company or the holders of any of the following securities:



_(a) Conversion Generally_. __ Each Company Common Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Company
Common Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.1(b) and Dissenting Shares
referred to in Section 3.7) shall be automatically converted, subject to this
Section 3.1 and Section 3.2(e), into the right to receive $27.00 in cash
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all
such Company Common Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any
such shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, subject to other provisions of this Section 3.1, Section
3.2(e) and Section 3.7.



_(b) Cancellation of Certain Shares_. __ Each Company Common Share held,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or
any Subsidiary of Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall be canceled
and extinguished without any conversion thereof, and no payment shall be made
with respect thereto.



_(c) Change in Shares_. __ In the event of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification,
combination, recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company
Common Shares occurring after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time, all references in this



 

-7- Agreement to specified numbers of shares of any class or series affected
thereby, and all calculations provided for that are based upon numbers of
shares of any class or series (or trading prices therefor) affected thereby,
shall be equitably adjusted to the extent necessary to provide the parties the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification,
combination, recapitalization or other like change.



_(d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of
capital stock of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will, by virtue of the Merger and without further
action on the part of the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, be converted into
and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation (and the
shares of Surviving Corporation into which the shares of Merger Sub capital
stock are so converted shall be the only shares of the Surviving Corporations
capital stock that are issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective
Time). Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub common
stock will evidence ownership of such shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.



_Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. _



(a) _Exchange Procedures_.



(i) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will instruct the Exchange Agent
(as defined below) to mail to each holder of record of Company Common Shares
(as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) (i) a letter of transmittal
that shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
certificates representing such holders Company Common Shares ("
_Certificates_ ") to the Exchange Agent and shall contain such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting surrender by such holder of Certificates to the Exchange Agent (as
defined in Section 3.2(b)) in exchange for the Merger Consideration.



(ii) The holder of each Certificate, upon the surrender by such holder to the
Exchange Agent of such Certificate, together with the letter of
transmittal duly completed and validly executed by such holder in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, shall be entitled to receive in exchange for
such Certificate a check for the Merger Consideration into which the Company
Common Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate have been converted
pursuant to Section 3.1, and such Certificate shall forthwith thereafter be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares
that is not registered on the transfer records of the Company, the cash
consideration payable hereunder with respect to such Company Common Shares may
be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer. Each Certificate shall be deemed at
all times from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right
to receive, upon exchange as contemplated in this Section 3.2, the Merger
Consideration into which the Company Common Shares formerly represented by
such Certificate are converted in the Merger. No interest shall be paid or
accrue on any Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate.



_(b) Exchange Agent_. __ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or a direct or
indirect Subsidiary of Parent shall make available to a nationally recognized
transfer agent or other paying agent reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for exchange in accordance with this
Article 3, through the Exchange Agent, an amount of cash sufficient to deliver
to the holders of Company Common Shares (other than Dissenting Shares (as
defined in Section 3.6)) the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") deliverable pursuant to
Section 3.1 in exchange for outstanding Company Common Shares. Promptly after
the Effective Time, Parent will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to
send, to each holder of record of Company Common Shares as



 

-8- of the Effective Time a letter of transmittal, in customary form, for use in
such exchange (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates theretofore representing Company Common
Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the
Exchange Agent or by appropriate guarantee of delivery in the form
customarily used in transactions of this nature from a member of a national
securities exchange, a member of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc., or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States) for
use in effecting delivery of Company Common Shares to the Exchange Agent. The
Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 3.1 out of the
Exchange Fund as promptly as reasonably practicable upon receipt of the
documents described above.



_(c) Further Rights in Company Common Shares_. __ All Merger Consideration
issued and paid upon conversion of the Company Common Shares in accordance
with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Shares.



_(d) Termination of Exchange Fund_. __ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Shares for six months
after the Effective Time shall be promptly delivered to Parent upon
demand, and any holders of Company Common Shares who have not theretofore
complied with this Article 3 shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to
applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws) for the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, only as a general unsecured
creditor thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
if any Certificate has not been surrendered within five years of the Effective
Time subject to applicable Law, any amounts payable in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, become the
property of the Parent, free and clear of all claims or interests of any
person previously entitled thereto.



_(e) No Liability_. __ None of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any person for any cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws.



_(f) Lost Certificates_. __ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by
Parent or the Exchange Agent in their respective discretion, the posting by
such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange
Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon. __



_(g) Withholding_. __ Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Shares, Company
Options or Company Warrants such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub or the
Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any
provision of state, local, provincial or foreign Tax Law, or pursuant to other
applicable judgments, decrees, injunctions or orders, with respect to the
making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent,
Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company
Common Shares, Company Options or Company Warrants in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent.



_Section 3.3 _Share Transfer Books_. _



At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and, thereafter, there shall be no further registration of transfers
of Company Common Shares theretofore outstanding on



 

-9- the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
certificates representing Company Common Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Common Shares, except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable
Laws. On and after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the
Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into the Merger
Consideration, without interest.



_Section 3.4 _Company Stock Options; Company Warrants_. _



_(a)_ At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding Company Option shall be
assumed by Parent, subject to, and exercisable upon, the same terms
and conditions as under the applicable Company Option and the applicable
option, option plan, severance, and other related agreements entered into with
the holder of each such Company Option provided that (i) from and after the
Effective Time, Parent and its Board of Directors or the Compensation
Committee of its Board of Directors, as the case may be, shall be substituted
for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Boards of
Directors and committees thereof for the purpose of administering the terms
and conditions under which such Company Option was granted and (ii) each
Company Option shall be automatically converted into an option to purchase a
number of Parent Common Shares, determined by multiplying the number
of Company Common Shares subject to such Company Option at the Effective Time
by the Exchange Ratio (as defined below), at an exercise price per Parent
Common Share equal to the exercise price per share of such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio. In the
case of a Company Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of
its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the conversion formula shall
be adjusted, if the Company determines that such adjustment is necessary, to
comply with Section 424(a) of the Code. The " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall be the
quotient (to four decimal places) of (A) the Merger Consideration divided by
(B) the Parent Closing Price. If the foregoing calculation results in an
assumed Company Option being exercisable for a fraction of a Parent Common
Share, then the number of Parent Common Shares subject to such option shall be
rounded up to the nearest whole number of Parent Common Shares. Except as
otherwise set forth in this Section 3.4, the term, status as an "incentive
stock option" under Section 422 of the Code, if applicable, all applicable
restrictions or limitations on transfer and vesting and all other terms and
conditions of each assumed Company Option shall, to the extent permitted by
Law and otherwise reasonably practicable, be unchanged. As soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company
(or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Stock
Option Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may
be required to effect the provisions of this Section 3.4.



_(b)_ As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than twenty
(20) days following the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) cause the Parent
Common Shares issuable upon exercise of the Company Options assumed under
subsection (a) above to be registered on Form S-8 (or any successor form)
(the " _Form S-8_ ") to the extent permitted by Law and (ii) use its
reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement for so long as such assumed Company Options remain outstanding.
Parent agrees to cause the Parent Common Shares to be issued upon exercise of
Company Options assumed by Parent to be authorized for quotation on the NASDAQ
National Market.



_(c)_ Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Parent, or an
appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt
a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
assumption of the Company Options held by Company Insiders (as defined below)
shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the 1934 Act by
any officer or director of Company who may become a covered person of Parent
for purposes of Section 16 of the 1934 Act (a " _Company Insider_ ").



 

-10- _(d)_ As of the Effective Time, the Company Warrants shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company or any Company
Warrant holder, be assumed in full by Parent.



_(e)_ The Company and Parent shall take all commercially reasonable actions
that are necessary in order to effect the foregoing provisions of this Section
3.4 as of the Effective Time.



_Section 3.5 _Unvested Company Shares_. _



The delivery of the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article 3
in exchange for Company Common Shares that immediately prior to the Effective
Time are restricted, not fully vested or subject to Repurchase Rights ("
_Unvested Company Shares_ ") shall be subject to the same terms,
conditions, restrictions, vesting arrangements or Repurchase Rights that were
applicable to such Unvested Company Shares immediately prior to or at the
Effective Time (and, except as set forth in Schedule 3.5, no vesting,
acceleration, or lapse of Repurchase Rights, shall occur with respect to such
Unvested Company Shares by reason of the Merger). Therefore, cash otherwise
payable pursuant to this Article 3 in exchange for each Company Common Share
that immediately prior to the Effective Time was restricted, subject to
Repurchase Rights or not fully vested (" _Unvested Cash_ ") shall not be
payable by Parent at the Effective Time, and shall instead be paid out by
Parent on the date that such Company Common Share would have become vested
(or for which the applicable Repurchase Right would have lapsed) under the
vesting schedule in place for such Company Common Share immediately prior to
the Effective Time (subject to the conditions and other terms of such
vesting schedule, and provided that if such conditions and terms are not
satisfied and vesting ceases to continue at any point after the Effective
Time, no cash payments shall be made, except the repurchase price described
below, with respect to the Unvested Company Shares). All amounts payable
pursuant to this Section 3.5 shall be subject to any required withholding of
Taxes and shall be paid without interest. By virtue of this Agreement, all
outstanding Repurchase Rights with respect to Unvested Company Shares that
the Company may hold immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assigned
to Parent in the Merger and shall thereafter be exercisable by Parent upon the
same terms and subject to the same conditions that were in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that Repurchase Rights may be exercised by
Parent paying to the former holder thereof the repurchase price in effect for
each such share subject to that Repurchase Right immediately prior to
the Effective Time and retaining the Unvested Cash into which such Unvested
Company Shares have been converted. Following the Effective Time, no Unvested
Cash, or right thereto, may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or
transferred (including any transfer by operation of Law), by any person,
other than parent, or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in
satisfaction of any debt or other liability of such person, prior to the
distribution to such person of such Unvested Cash in accordance with this
Agreement.



_Section 3.6 _Escrowed Shares_. _



Each issued and outstanding Company Common Share held in escrow immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the " _Escrow Shares_ ") pursuant to the terms of
that certain Indemnification Escrow Agreement by and between the Company, U.S.
Bank National Association and the other signatories thereto (the "
_Recipients_ ") dated as of April 20, 2005 (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") shall
be treated in all respects as an issued and outstanding Company Common Share
pursuant to this Article 3 and shall be automatically converted, subject to
Sections 3.1 and 3.2, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The
Merger Consideration for the Escrow Shares shall be paid to the Escrow Agent
(as defined in the Escrow Agreement) to be held in escrow pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to provide instructions to the Escrow Agent and take all other actions
necessary to effectuate the foregoing.



 

-11- _Section 3.7 _Dissenting Stockholders_. _



Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Common
Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has demanded appraisal for such Company Common Shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration and will be paid
for by the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL;
provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise
shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal and payment under the
DGCL, the right of such holder to such appraisal of its Company Common Shares
shall cease, and such Company Common Shares shall be deemed converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in this Article 3. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
written demands (or purported demands) for appraisal received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other related instruments served
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the Company. The Company
shall allow Parent the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisals under the DGCL and the
Company shall not, except with Parents prior written consent, (i) voluntarily
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal for Dissenting
Shares, (ii) offer to settle, or settle, any such demands, (iii) waive any
failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal in accordance with
the DGCL, or (iv) agree to do any of the foregoing.



Article 4.

_Company Representations and Warranties_



Subject to such exceptions as are set forth in the disclosure schedule (the "
_Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger
Sub concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (it being
understood that the disclosure of any matter or item in the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgement that
such matter or item is required to be disclosed therein or is material to a
representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement and shall not be used
as a basis for interpreting the terms "material," "materially," "materiality"
or "Material Adverse Effect" or any word or phrase of similar import and does
not mean that such matter or item would, with any other matter or item, have
or be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company), the Company represents and warrants

Subsidiary has the requisite power and authority and all necessary
governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted and as currently proposed by it
to be conducted. Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly
qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification, licensing or
good standing necessary other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to
be so qualified individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.



 

-12- _(b)_ Section 4.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of all of the Company Subsidiaries and the
jurisdictions of their organization. Except as set forth on Section 4.1(b) of

duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Except as set

Subsidiary, free and clear of all Encumbrances and are not subject to any
preemptive right or right of first refusal created by statute, the Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, as
applicable, of such Company Subsidiary or any contract to which such Company
Subsidiary is a party or by which it is bound. There are no outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, "put" or "call" rights, exchangeable or
convertible securities or other contracts of any character relating to the

reserved for issuance as set forth in this Section 4.3 or Section 4.3 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no options, warrants or other rights or

the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue or sell any of its capital
shares or other Equity Interests, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for such capital shares of, or other Equity Interests in, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary. Since the Company Balance Sheet Date,

approvals and clearances of any Governmental Entity, and has made all material
filings, applications and registrations with any Governmental Entity, in each
case that are necessary for the Company and each Company Subsidiary to own,
lease and/or operate its properties or other assets, or to carry on its
respective businesses substantially in the manner described in the Company SEC
Reports (as defined in Section 4.7) filed prior to the date hereof
and substantially as it is being conducted as of the date hereof (the "
_Company Permits_ "), and all such Company Permits are valid and in full force
and effect, except where the failure to have, or the suspension or
cancellation of, or failure to be valid or in full force and effect of, any
of the Company Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to (i) prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger or
any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) otherwise prevent
or materially delay performance by the Company of any of its material
obligations under this Agreement, or (iii) have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is in conflict
with, or in default or violation of, (A) in any material respect, any Law
applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any property
or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected or (B)
any Company Permit, except, with respect to clause (B), for any such
conflicts, defaults or violations that would not, individually or in the

consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) otherwise prevent or materially delay performance by the
Company of any of its material obligations under this Agreement, or (c) have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. None of the Company Permits will be
terminated or impaired or will become terminable, in whole or in part, as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has, within the last three years, received any
warning, notice, notice of violation or probable violation, notice of
revocation or other communication from or on behalf of any Governmental
Entity, alleging (x) any violation of any Company Permit or (y) that the
Company or any Company Subsidiary requires any Company Permit for its
business as currently conducted that is not currently held by it. Except as
set forth in Section 4.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, to the Companys
knowledge, no investigation or inquiry by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary is pending or threatened, in
each case with respect to any alleged or claimed violation of Law applicable
to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected. Neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries, nor to the Companys knowledge,
any director, officer, Affiliate or employee thereof, has on behalf of or
with respect to the Company engaged in any conduct constituting a violation
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended.



_Section 4.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_. _



_(a)_ The Company has filed all forms, statements, schedules, reports and
documents (including items incorporated by reference) required to be filed by
the Company with the SEC since the effective date of the registration
statement for the Companys initial public offering and all such forms,
statements, schedules, reports and documents in the form filed with the SEC
have been Made Available to Parent. All such required forms, statements,
schedules, reports and documents (including those that Company may file

material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent
corrected (A) in the case



 

-16- of Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement that were
amended or superseded prior to the date of this Agreement, by the filing of
such amending or superseding Company SEC Report and (B) in the case of Company
SEC Reports filed after the date of this Agreement that are amended or

presented in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and
the consolidated results of Companys and the Company Subsidiaries
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the unaudited
interim financial statements may not contain footnotes and were or are subject
to normal and recurring year-end adjustments in accordance with GAAP and any
other exceptions noted therein. The balance sheet of the Company as of
September 30, 2005 (the " _Company Balance Sheet Date_ ") contained in the
Company SEC Reports is hereinafter referred to as the " _Company Balance
Sheet._ " Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liabilities
(absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) required under GAAP to be set
forth on a balance sheet that are, individually or in the aggregate, material
to the business, results of operations or financial condition of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole, except for (A) liabilities
incurred since the Company Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice which are of the type that
typically recur and which do not result from any breach of contract, tort or
violation of any Law, (B) those specifically set forth or specifically and
adequately reserved against in the Company Balance Sheet, and (C) the fees
and expenses of investment bankers, attorneys and accountants incurred in
connection with this Agreement. Except as reflected in the Company Financial

material off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined in Item 303 of Regulation
S-K). The Company has not had any disagreement with any of its auditors
regarding accounting matters or policies during any of its past three full
fiscal years or during the current fiscal year-to-date. The books and records
of the Company and each Company Subsidiary have been maintained, and are being
maintained, in all material respects in accordance with applicable legal and
accounting requirements, and the Company Financial Statements are consistent
in all material respects with such books and records.



_(c)_ No investigation by the SEC with respect to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened. 



_(d)_ The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) that are reasonably designed to ensure that material information
(both financial and non-financial) relating to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is communicated to the Companys
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or
persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the
principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of the Company
required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (" _SOXA_ ") with
respect to such reports. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive
officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to
such terms in SOXA. Each of the principal executive officer of the Company
and the principal financial officer of the Company (or each former principal
executive officer of the Company and each former principal financial officer
of the Company, as applicable) has made all certifications required by
Sections 302 and 906 of SOXA and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder with respect to the Company SEC Reports.



 

-17- _(e)_ The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed
to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed in
accordance with managements general or specific authorizations, (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability,
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements
general or specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded accountability for
assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals
and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. The Company
has Made Available to Parent accurate and complete copies of all material
policies, manuals and other documents promulgating such internal accounting
controls. Except as set forth in Section 4.7(e) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, to the Companys knowledge, there are no "material weaknesses" (as
defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) and there are no
series of multiple "significant deficiencies" (as defined by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board) that are reasonably likely to collectively
represent a "material weakness" in the design or operation of the Companys
internal controls and procedures, and to the Companys knowledge, as of the
date of this Agreement there are no significant deficiencies, in the design or
operation of the Companys internal controls and procedures. To the Companys
knowledge, since the date of its initial public offering, there has been no
fraud that involves management or other employees who have a significant role
in the Companys internal controls and procedures.

qualified status under the Code, or (ii) has been established under a
standardized master and prototype or volume submitter plan for which a

letter or opinion letter issued with respect to each such the Company Benefit
Plan, and, to the Companys knowledge, nothing



 

-20- has occurred since the issuance of each such letter that could reasonably be
expected to cause the loss of the Tax-qualified status of any Company Benefit
Plan subject to Section 401(a) of the Code. The Company has also Made

Plan, where applicable. All individuals who, pursuant to the terms of any

_(c)_ None of the Company Benefit Plans promises or provides retiree medical
or other retiree welfare benefits to any person other than as required under
the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("
_COBRA_ ") or applicable state law. There has been no prohibited transaction
(within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code) with

each ERISA Affiliate has performed all obligations required to be performed
by it under, is not in any material respect in default under or in violation
of, and has no knowledge of any material default or in violation by any other
party to, any of the Company Benefit Plans. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate is subject to any liability or penalty
under Sections 4976 through 4980 of the Code or Title I of ERISA with respect
to any of the Company Benefit Plans. All contributions required to be made by
the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate to any Company
Benefit Plan have been made on or before their due dates and, to the extent
required by GAAP, all amounts have been accrued for the current plan year (and
no further contributions will be due or will have accrued thereunder as of
the Closing Date, other than contributions accrued in the ordinary course of
business, consistent with past practice, after the Company Balance Sheet Date
as a result of the operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
after the Company Balance Sheet Date). In addition, with respect to each
Company Benefit Plan intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement,
the Company and each Company Subsidiary and ERISA Affiliate have at all times
made timely deposits of employee salary reduction contributions and
participant loan repayments, as determined pursuant to regulations issued by
the United States Department of Labor. No Company Benefit Plan that is an
employee welfare benefit plan as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA is a self-
insured plan. No Company Benefit Plan is covered by, and neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate has incurred or expects to incur
any liability under, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. With
respect to each Company Benefit Plan subject to ERISA as either an employee
pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA or an
employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA,
the Company has prepared in good faith and timely filed all requisite
governmental reports (which were true, correct and complete as of the date
filed), including any required audit reports, and has properly and timely
filed and distributed or posted all notices and reports to employees required
to be filed, distributed or posted with respect to each such Company Benefit
Plan. No suit, administrative proceeding, action or other litigation has been
brought, or to the knowledge of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, is
threatened, against the Company or any Company Subsidiary or with respect to
any such Company Benefit Plan, including any audit or inquiry by the Internal
Revenue Service or United States Department of Labor.



_(d)_ Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate is a
party to, or has made any contribution to or otherwise incurred any obligation
under, any "multiemployer plan" as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA or any "multiple employer plan" as such term is defined in Section
413(c) of the Code. There has been no termination or partial termination of
any Company Benefit Plan within the meaning of Section 411(d)(3) of the Code.



 

-21- _(e)_ Each compensation and benefit plan required to be maintained or
contributed to by Law or applicable custom or rule of the relevant
jurisdiction outside of the United States (each such plan, a " _Foreign Plan_
") is listed in Section 4.10(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule except for
plans maintained by Governmental Entities. As regards each Foreign Plan, (i)
such Foreign Plan is in compliance with the provisions of the laws of each
jurisdiction in which such Foreign Plan is maintained, to the extent those
laws are applicable to such Foreign Plan, (ii) the Company, each Company
Subsidiary, and each ERISA Affiliate has complied with all applicable
reporting and notice requirements, and such Foreign Plan has obtained from the

been administered in accordance with its terms and applicable Law and
regulations.

Schedule, none of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (or such transactions in
combination with any subsequent transactions or events, other
than transactions or events initiated solely by Parent) will (i) result in
any employee, director or consultant of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
becoming entitled to any deferred compensation, bonus or severance pay or
materially increase or otherwise enhance any benefits otherwise payable by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii) result in the acceleration of the
time of payment or vesting, or an increase in the amount of any compensation
due to any employee, director or consultant of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, except as may be required under Section 411(d)(3) of the Code,
(iii) result in forgiveness in whole or in part of any outstanding loans made
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any of their employees, directors
or consultants, or (iv) result in a payment that would be considered an
"excess parachute payment" and treated as nondeductible under Section 280G of
the Code or subject to the excise Tax under Section 4999 of the Code.



_(i)_ To the Companys knowledge, the Company has neither granted, nor is a
party to, any contract that grants any compensation, equity award, or bonus,
that fails to comply in good faith with the provisions of Section 409A of the
Code.



_(j)_ Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is in compliance in all
material respects with all currently applicable Laws respecting employment,

The Company and each Company Subsidiary has paid in full to all employees,

no controversies pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,
between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any of their respective
employees, which controversies have or could reasonably be expected to result
in an action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation before
any Governmental Entity.



_(k)_ Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has any
obligation to pay any amount or provide any benefit to any former employee or
officer, other than obligations (i) for which Company has established a
reserve for such amount on the Company Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP
and (ii) pursuant to contracts entered into after the Company Balance Sheet
Date and disclosed on Section 4.10(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract, no collective
bargaining agreement is being negotiated by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any duty to
bargain with any labor organization. There is no pending demand for
recognition or any other request or demand from a labor organization for

any Company Subsidiary. The Company has no knowledge of any activities or
proceedings of any labor union or to organize their respective employees.

federal, state, local, and foreign Tax Returns required to be filed by it in
the manner prescribed by applicable Laws and all such Tax Returns were true,

that are immaterial in amount, all Taxes (as defined below) of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries (whether or not shown or required to be shown on
any Tax Return) that are due and payable have been timely paid in full and the
accruals and reserves for Taxes (rather than any reserve for deferred
Taxes established to reflect timing difference between book and Tax income)
reflected in the Companys Balance Sheet (rather than any notes thereto) are
adequate in accordance with GAAP to cover all unpaid Taxes of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries. Except with respect to Taxes that are immaterial in
amount, all reserves for Taxes as adjusted for operations and transactions and
the passage of time through the Effective Date in accordance with past custom
and practice of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are adequate in

Subsidiary as a result of examinations by any state, local, federal
or foreign Taxing authority and no issue has been raised by any examination
conducted by any state, local, federal or foreign Taxing authority that, by
application of the same principles, might result in a proposed deficiency for
any other period not so examined. Each deficiency resulting from any audit or
examination relating to Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any
Taxing authority has been paid or is being contested in good faith and in
accordance with the Law and is fully reserved for on the Company Balance
Sheet in accordance with GAAP. No claim has ever been made by an authority in
a jurisdiction where the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries does not
file Tax Returns that the Company or any Company Subsidiary, as the case may
be, is or may be subject to Tax in that jurisdiction. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary is subject to any private letter ruling of the Internal
Revenue Service or comparable rulings of other Tax authorities that will be
binding on the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to any period
following the Closing Date. Neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has granted any power of attorney that is currently in force with

"listed transaction") or any confidential corporate Tax shelter within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6111-2.



_(f)_ Except as set forth in Section 4.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has been a member of any
affiliated, combined, consolidated or unitary group other than the group of
which the Company is the parent. None of the Company or any Company

obligation with respect to, (i) Taxes of any person under Treasury Regulation

Subsidiary will be required to include in income, or exclude any item of
deduction from, Taxable income for any Taxable period (or portion thereof)

described in Code Section 7121 (or any corresponding or similar provision of

hereby, or (vii) take any action or position that is inconsistent with, or
withdraw or modify (or publicly propose or announce any intention or desire to
withdraw or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, any determination or
recommendation referred to in Section 6.4. The Company and the Company

writing of (i) an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any inquiry, expression of
interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected

promptly as practicable, of the status and details (including any amendments,
modifications or proposed amendments or modifications) of any such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer, notice
or request and (y) provide to Parent, as promptly as practicable, a copy of
all written materials and other information provided to the Company in
connection with any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, expression of
interest, proposal, offer, notice or request. The Company shall provide Parent
with at least three (3) business days prior written notice (or such lesser
prior notice as provided to the members of the Company Board but in no event
less than twenty-four (24) hours) of any meeting of the Company Board at which
the Company Board is reasonably expected to discuss any Acquisition Proposal,
including to determine whether such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer.



_(c) Superior Offers_. In the event that any person submits to the Company
(and does not withdraw) an unsolicited, written, bona fide Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board reasonably concludes in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) is, or is
likely to become, a Superior Offer, then notwithstanding Section 6.6(a), the
Company may, so long as the Company Stockholder Approval has not yet been
obtained, (i) enter into discussions with such person regarding
such Acquisition Proposal and (ii) deliver or make available to such person
non-public information regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries;
_provided_ (A) neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary nor any
Representative of the Company shall have taken any of the actions described
in any of clauses (i) through (viii) of Section 6.6(a), and the Company shall
have complied with the requirements of Section 6.6(b), (B) the Company Board
first shall have concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that such action is required in order for the Company Board to
comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Laws, (C) at least 48 hours (which shall not include hours between
12:00 am and 11:59 pm on any non-business day) shall have elapsed since the
Companys written notice to Parent (which shall be given following the Company
Board meeting referred to in Section 6.6(b) above) that it intends to take
actions in response to such Superior Offer (specifying the action to be
taken), (D) the Company first shall have received from such person an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive with regard
to the Companys confidential information as the Confidentiality Agreement,
it being understood that such confidentiality agreement shall not include any
provision for any exclusive right to negotiate with such person or having the
actual or purported effect of restricting the Company from fulfilling its
obligations under this Agreement, and (D) prior to or contemporaneously with
delivering or making available any such nonpublic information to such person,
the Company shall deliver such non-public information to Parent (to the
extent such non-public information has not been previously delivered or Made

Offer is made to the Company and is not withdrawn, (iv) the Company shall

Parent that the Company has received a Superior Offer and that it intends (or
may intend) to change the Company Board Recommendation and the manner and
timing in which it intends (or may intend) to do so, (v) the Company, for a
period of five (5) business days following the Companys delivery of each
Notice of Superior Offer (which period may run concurrently with the period
set forth in Section 8.1(h)), shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent
regarding such changes in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as may be
proposed by Parent in writing, and (vi) following such five (5) day
period, the Company Board concludes in good faith, after



 

-45- consultation with its outside legal counsel, that in light of such Superior
Offer and any changes proposed by Parent in writing pursuant to Section
6.6(d)(v), the failure of the Company Board to effect a change in the Company
Board Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to
the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

 



_(e) Compliance with Tender Offer Rules_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to
its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that neither
the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend

appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or
proposals, each of Parent and the Company need not supply the other (or its
counsel) with copies (or in case of oral presentations, a summary) to
the extent that any Law applicable to such party requires such party or the
Company Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or
information.



_(b)_ Each party will notify the other promptly upon the receipt of (i) any
comments from any officials of any Governmental Entity in connection with any
filings made pursuant hereto and (ii) any request by any officials of any
Governmental Entity for amendments or supplements to any filings made pursuant
to, or information provided to comply in all material respects with, any
Laws. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an

contest any administrative or judicial action or proceeding or any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, and (ii) Parent shall be under no obligation to make
proposals, execute or carry out agreements or submit to orders providing for

6.7.

_Indemnified Parties_ ") and any indemnification provisions under the Company
Certificate of Incorporation or Company Bylaws as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, in each case, subject to applicable Law (including, to
the extent indemnifiable, for acts or omissions occurring in connection with
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby).
The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will
contain provisions with respect to indemnification that are at least as
favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Company

in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering
each individual who at the date of this Agreement was an Indemnified Party
covered as of the date hereof or hereafter by the Companys directors and
officers liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and
amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or Surviving
Corporation be required to expend more than an amount per year equal to 200%
of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (the "

necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum
Amount, Parent and Surviving Corporation shall procure and maintain for such
six-year period as much coverage as reasonably practicable for the Maximum
Amount. Parent shall have the right to cause coverage to be extended under the
Companys DandO Insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy on terms and
conditions no less advantageous than the Companys existing DandO Insurance
provided by one or more unaffiliated, third party commercial insurance
providers, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this
Section 6.10.

assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, or at
Parents option, Parent, shall assume, fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.10.

_Section 6.11 _Employees_. _



_(a)_ From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Merger Sub shall have
the rights and obligations described in this Section 6.11 regarding the
individuals who were employees of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time and who continue employment with the Company, a



 

-48- Company Subsidiary or Parent following the Effective Time (" _Continuing

Company shall confer and work together in good faith to determine appropriate
employment terms, and (ii) the Company shall, in good faith, cooperate with
Parent and assist Parent with its efforts to enter into an offer letters,
assignment of invention agreements and related documents after the date of
this Agreement and in any event prior to the Closing Date.



_(b)_ Within a reasonable period of time after the last business day of each
month after the date of this Agreement and on or about the date that is five
(5) business days prior to the expected date on which the Closing will occur,
if there shall have been any change in the information required to be set
forth in Section 4.10(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company
shall, deliver to Parent a revised Section 4.10(f) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, which sets forth each person who the Company reasonably believes is,
with respect to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, a
"disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder), as of the date such revised Section
4.10(f) is delivered to Parent.



_(c)_ Parent, in the event it does not continue the employee welfare benefit
plans sponsored and maintained by the Company, will take commercially
reasonable efforts to cause Continuing Employees to be eligible for employee
welfare benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the
benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or
its Subsidiaries. To the extent Parent elects to have Continuing Employees,
and their eligible dependents where applicable, participate in Parents
employee benefit plans, programs or policies following the Closing Date, (i)
Parent will allow such Continuing Employees, and their eligible dependents
where applicable, to participate in such plans, programs and policies on terms
substantially similar to those provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent or its Subsidiaries, (ii) each such Continuing Employee will receive
credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting under such
plans, programs and policies for years of service with Company (or any of its
Subsidiaries) prior to the Closing Date, provided such credit does not result
in duplication of benefits, and (iii) Parent, to the extent required by
applicable Law and as permitted by the terms of the applicable group health
plans, will give credit for any co-payments or deductibles paid during the
year in which the Closing Date occurs and will cause any and all pre-existing
condition limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of
insurability requirements under any group health plans of Parent in which such

warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement.



_(b) Company Termination Fee._



(i) The Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of $26,800,000 in
immediately available funds in the event that this Agreement is terminated
(A) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or (B) by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(d) if at such time Parent was entitled to terminate pursuant to
Section 8.1(e) or (C) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(h). Any payment
required to be made pursuant to this Section 8.2(b)(i) shall be made no later
than two (2) business days after the date of termination, and shall be in lieu
of any payments to be made under Section 8.2(b)(ii).



(ii) The Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of (A) $13,400,000
in immediately available funds in the event that this Agreement is terminated
by either party pursuant to Section 8.1(d) (other than by the Company if at
such time Parent was entitled to terminate pursuant to



 

-53- Section 8.1(e)) and, at any time after the date of this Agreement and before
the vote on this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting, an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company shall have been publicly
announced and (B) an additional $13,400,000 in immediately available funds in
the event that the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal, or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated, within 12

(2) business days after the date of termination and any payment required to
be made pursuant to Section 8.2(b)(ii)(B) shall be made no later than two (2)

be made pursuant to this Section 8.2(b)(ii) shall be in lieu of any payments
to be made under Section 8.2(b)(i).



(iii) Payment of the amounts described in this Section 8.2(b) shall not be in
lieu of damages incurred in the event of willful breach of this Agreement.
All payments under Section 8.2(b) shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent. The
Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that,
without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due to the other
party pursuant to this Section 8.2(b) and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for all
or any portion of the amounts set forth in this Section 8.2(b), the Company
shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the aggregate amount of the fees and expenses at a rate equal to
the prime rate reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the date such payment

Subject to Section 6.10(d), this Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that, after
the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no amendment may be made
without further stockholder approval that, by Law or in accordance with the
rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further approval by such
stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by the parties hereto.



_Section 8.4 _Waiver_. _



At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may (i) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other party hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive compliance by the other party with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein; provided, however, that after
the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there may not be, without
further approval of such stockholders, any extension or waiver of this
Agreement or any portion thereof that, by Law or in accordance with the rules
of any relevant stock exchange, requires further approval by such
stockholders. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.



_Section 8.5 _Fees and Expenses_. _



Subject to Section 8.2, all Expenses incurred by the parties hereto shall be
borne solely and entirely by the party that has incurred the same; provided,
however, that each of Parent and the Company shall pay one-half of the filing
fee(s) for filings made pursuant to Antitrust Laws.

The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.



_Section 9.4 _Severability_. _



If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other
terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force
and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially

is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the

_Section 9.5 _Entire Agreement_. _



This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, Schedules, Company
Disclosure Schedule, Parent Disclosure Schedule and the other documents
delivered pursuant hereto), the Voting Agreements and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all
prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties,
or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and, except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, are not intended to confer upon any other
person any rights or remedies hereunder.



_Section 9.6 _Assignment_. _



None of this Agreement or any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in
whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written

and obligations under this Agreement to any wholly owned Parent Subsidiary
without the Companys consent.



_Section 9.7 _Parties in Interest_. _



This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each party hereto and their respective successors and assigns, and nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, other than pursuant to Section 6.10, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.



_Section 9.8 _Mutual Drafting_. _



The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel during
the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the
application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing
that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against
the party drafting such agreement or document.



_Section 9.9 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by
Jury_. _



_(a)_ This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of Delaware without reference to such states principles

_(b)_ Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state



 

-56- appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements
delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto,
and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not
to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts, (ii) agrees
that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such Delaware state court or, to the extent permitted by Law, in
such Federal court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such Delaware state or
Federal court, and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such Delaware state or Federal court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in Section 9.2. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party
to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.



_(c)_ EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (1) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (2) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (3) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (4) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
9.9(C). 



_Section 9.10 _Disclosure_. _



Any matter set forth in any section of a partys Disclosure Schedule shall be
considered disclosed for other sections of such Disclosure Schedule, but only
to the extent that it would be readily apparent that such matter on its face
would apply to a particular section of a partys Disclosure Schedule.
The provision of monetary or other quantitative thresholds for disclosure
does not and shall not be deemed to create or imply a standard of materiality
hereunder.



 

 _Section 9.11 _Counterparts_. _



This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.



_Section 9.12 _Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance_. _



Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
a waiver by any party of



 

-57- any right to specific performance or injunctive relief. The parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in
equity. Each party hereto agrees to waive any requirement for the posting of,
or securing of, a bond in connection with any such remedy.



_Section 9.13  _Interpretation_. _



_(a)_ When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles, Sections,
Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or
an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Where a

headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.



_(b)_ The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall
be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The

A. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Stockholder is a material
inducement to the willingness of Acquiror to enter into that certain Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the "Merger Agreement"), by
and among Acquiror, EArts(Delaware), Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-
owned subsidiary of Acquiror ("Sub") and the Company, pursuant to which Sub
will merge with and into the Company (the "Merger"), and the Company will
survive the Merger and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror.



B. Stockholder understands and acknowledges that the Company and Acquiror are
entitled to rely on (i) the truth and accuracy of
Stockholders representations contained herein and (ii) Stockholders
performance of the obligations set forth herein.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants and
agreements set forth in the Merger Agreement and in this Agreement, and other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:



1\. _Restrictions on Shares_.



(a) Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, transfer (except as may be
specifically required by court order or by operation of law), grant an option
with respect to, sell, exchange, pledge or otherwise dispose of, or encumber,
the Shares (as such term is defined in Section 4 below) or any New Shares (as
such term is defined in Section 1(d) below), or make any offer or enter into
any agreement providing for any of the foregoing, at any time from the date
of this Agreement and prior to the Expiration Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing contained herein will be deemed to restrict the ability of
Stockholder to exercise, prior to the Expiration Date, any Company Stock
Options held by Stockholder. As used herein, the term "Expiration Date" shall
mean the earlier of (i) the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger
Agreement), and (ii) the date and time of the valid termination of the Merger
Agreement in accordance with its terms and (iii) any amendment or other
modification of the Merger Agreement that reduces the amount of merger
consideration payable per share to stockholders or provides that the merger
consideration shall be payable otherwise than in cash.



(b) Except pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, at any time from the date
of this Agreement and prior to the Expiration Date, Stockholder shall not,
directly or indirectly, grant any proxies or powers of attorney with respect
to any of the Shares, deposit any of the Shares into a voting trust, or enter
into a voting agreement or similar arrangement or commitment with respect to
any of the Shares.



(c) At any time from the date of this Agreement and prior to the Expiration
Date, Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, take any action that
would make any representation or



 

-1- warranty contained herein untrue or incorrect or have the effect of impairing
the ability of Stockholder to perform its obligations under this Agreement
or, in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company, preventing or delaying
the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby.



(d) Any shares of Company Common Stock or other securities of the Company that
Stockholder purchases or with respect to which Stockholder otherwise acquires
beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the Expiration Date, (collectively,
the "New Shares") shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement to the same extent as if they constituted Shares.



2\. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. Prior to the Expiration Date, at every meeting
of the stockholders of the Company called with respect to any of the
following, and at every adjournment or postponement thereof, and on every
action or approval by written consent or resolution of the stockholders of the
Company with respect to any of the following, Stockholder shall vote, to the
extent not voted by the person(s) appointed under the Proxy (as defined in
Section 3 below) the Shares and any New Shares in favor of approval of the
Merger, the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the Certificate of Merger and
any other matter that is contemplated by the Merger Agreement and any action
required in furtherance thereof, and against any Acquisition Proposal (as
such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) and any other matter that would
reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or adversely
affect the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement. This obligation shall continue in full force and effect unless an
amendment to the Merger Agreement reduces the amount of per share merger
consideration payable to stockholders or provides that the merger
consideration is payable otherwise than in cash.



3.  _Irrevocable Proxy_. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Stockholder shall deliver to Acquiror a duly executed proxy in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the "Proxy"), which proxy is coupled
with an interest, and, until the Expiration Date, shall be irrevocable to the
fullest extent permitted by law, with respect to each and every meeting of
stockholders of the Company or action or approval by written resolution or
consent of stockholders of the Company with respect to the matters
contemplated by Section 2 covering the total number of Shares and New Shares
in respect of which Stockholder is entitled to vote at any such meeting or in
connection with any such written consent and which such Proxy shall
automatically terminate upon the Expiration Date. Upon the execution of this
Agreement by Stockholder, (i) Stockholder hereby revokes any and all prior
proxies (other than the Proxy) given by Stockholder with respect to the
subject matter contemplated by Section 2, and (ii) Stockholder shall not grant
any subsequent proxies with respect to such subject matter, or enter into any
agreement or understanding with any Person to vote or give instructions
with respect to the Shares and New Shares in any manner inconsistent with the
terms of Section 2, until after the Expiration Date.



4\. _Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Stockholder_. Stockholder
hereby represents, warrants and covenants to Acquiror as as follows: 



(a) Stockholder is the beneficial or record owner of, or is trustee of a
trust that is the record holder of, and whose beneficiaries are the beneficial
owners of, or exercises voting power over, that number of shares of Company
Common Stock set forth on the signature page hereto (all such shares
owned beneficially or of record by Stockholder, or over which Stockholder
exercises voting power, on the date hereof, collectively, the "Shares"). The
Shares constitute Stockholders entire interest in the outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock and Stockholder does not hold any other outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company. No person not a signatory to this
Agreement has a beneficial interest in or a right to acquire or vote any of
the Shares. The Shares are and will be at all times up until the Expiration
Date free and clear of any security interests, liens, claims, pledges,
options, rights of first



 

-2- refusal, co-sale rights, agreements, limitations on Stockholders voting
rights, charges and other encumbrances of any nature that would adversely
affect the Merger or the exercise or fulfillment of the rights and obligations
of the Company under the Merger Agreement or of the parties to this Agreement.
Stockholders principal residence or place of business is set forth on the
signature page hereto.



(b) Stockholder has all requisite power, capacity and authority to enter into
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Stockholder and the consummation
by Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary action, if any, on the part of Stockholder. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Stockholder and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Acquiror,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Stockholder, enforceable against
Stockholder in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar
laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally and to general
principles of equity.



(c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the
provisions hereof will not, conflict with, result in a breach or violation of
or default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or require
notice to or the consent of any person under, any agreement, law, rule,
regulation, judgment, order or decree by which Stockholder is bound, except
for such conflicts, breaches, violations or defaults that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay consummation of
the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and this
Agreement or otherwise prevent or materially delay Stockholder from performing
his, her or its obligations under this Agreement.



5\. _Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Acquiror_. Acquiror hereby
represents, warrants and covenants to Stockholder as follows:

 



(a) Acquiror has all requisite power, capacity and authority to enter into
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Acquiror has been duly authorized
by all necessary action, if any, on the part of Acquiror. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by Acquiror and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Stockholder,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Acquiror, enforceable against
Acquiror in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
affecting creditors rights and remedies generally and to general principles
of equity.



(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with
the provisions hereof will not, conflict with, result in a breach or violation
of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or
require notice to or the consent of any person under, any agreement, law,
rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree by which Acquiror is bound, except
for such conflicts, breaches, violations or defaults that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay consummation of
the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and this
Agreement or otherwise prevent or materially delay Acquiror from performing
his, her or its obligations under this Agreement.

 



6\. _Consent and Waiver_. Stockholder hereby gives any consents or waivers
that are reasonably required for the consummation of the Merger under the
terms of any agreement or instrument to which Stockholder is a party. Without
limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, Stockholder hereby waives
any and all rights to contest or object to the execution and delivery of the
Merger Agreement, the Company Board of Directors actions in approving and
recommending the Merger, the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions provided for in the Merger Agreement, or to seek



 

-3- damages or other legal or equitable relief in connection therewith. From and
after the Effective Time, Stockholders right to receive cash on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement shall
constitute Stockholders sole and exclusive right against the Company and/or
Acquiror in respect of Stockholders ownership of the Shares or status as a
Stockholder of the Company or any agreement or instrument with the Company
pertaining to the Shares or Stockholders status as a Stockholder of the
Company.



7\. _Confidentiality_. Stockholder shall hold any information regarding this
Agreement and the Merger in strict confidence and shall not divulge any such
information to any third person (except to Stockholders legal counsel) until
the Company has publicly disclosed the Merger. Neither the Stockholder, nor
any of its affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement, the
Merger, the Merger Agreement or the other transactions contemplated thereby
without the prior written consent of the Acquiror, except as may be required
by law or by any listing agreement with, or the policies of, the Nasdaq Stock
Market in which circumstance such announcing party shall make reasonable
efforts to consult with the Acquiror to the extent practicable.



8\. _Appraisal Rights_. Stockholder agrees not to exercise any rights
of appraisal or any dissenters rights that Stockholder may have (whether
under applicable law or otherwise) or could potentially have or acquire in
connection with the Merger.



9\. _Capacity_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that this Agreement
and the Proxy are entered into by Stockholder in Stockholders capacity as a
stockholder of the Company and shall not be construed to have any effect,
obligation, restriction, limitation or liability on Stockholder, or (if
applicable) Stockholders officers, directors, employees, agents or
representatives, in any other manner or capacity, including without
limitation, in any capacity as an officer, director, employee, agent or
representative of the Company. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that any vote by Stockholder in approval of the
Merger, the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the Certificate of Merger and
any other matter that is contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or by any
persons appointed by Proxy with respect to any or all of such matters, shall
not constitute the actual or deemed approval by Stockholder of any agreement
or matter contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including without limitation
the entering into of any agreement for the provision of employment or other
services by Stockholder following the closing of the Merger) that affects
Stockholder in his/its capacity other than as a shareholder of the Company.



10\. _Termination_. For clarification, this Agreement and the Proxy delivered
in connection herewith shall automatically terminate and shall have no
further force or effect as of the Expiration Date.



11\. _Miscellaneous_.



(a)  _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed given on (i) the date of delivery, if delivered
personally or by commercial delivery service, or (ii) on the date of

(b) _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections
or Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section of or an Exhibit to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. The words "include," "includes" and
"including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The phrases "the date of this Agreement", "the
date hereof", and terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise
requires, shall be deemed to refer to the date first above written.



(c) _Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief_. The parties hereto acknowledge
that Acquiror will be irreparably harmed and that there will be no adequate
remedy at law for a violation of any of the covenants or agreements of
Stockholder set forth herein or in the Proxy. Therefore, it is agreed that, in
addition to any other remedies that may be available to Acquiror upon any such
violation of this Agreement or the Proxy, Acquiror shall have the right to
enforce such covenants and agreements and the Proxy by specific performance,
injunctive relief or by any other means available to Acquiror at law or in
equity and Stockholder hereby waives any and all defenses which could exist
in its favor in connection with such enforcement and waives any requirement
for the security or posting of any bond in connection with such enforcement.



(d) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
instrument and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties hereto; it
being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.



(e) _Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest_. This Agreement
and the documents and instruments and other agreements specifically referred
to herein or delivered pursuant hereto (including, without limitation, the
Proxy) (i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written



 

-5- and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and (ii)
are not intended to confer, and shall not be construed as conferring, upon
any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. The
parties hereto have not relied on and expressly disclaim reliance on any
representations or statements made outside the terms of this Agreement. None
of this Agreement or any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder
shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other
parties, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent
shall be null and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub may assign,
in its sole discretion, any and all rights, interests and obligations under
this Agreement to any wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror without the
Companys consent. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns (including, without
limitation, any person to whom any Shares are sold, transferred or assigned).



(f) _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto
further agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to replace such
void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.



(g) _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party shall be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy shall
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.



(h) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of Delaware without reference to such
states principles of conflicts of law. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware
and the Federal courts of the United States of America located within the
State of Delaware solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of
the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit
or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or thereof, that it
is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be
brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may
not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be
enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that
all claims with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and
determined in such a Delaware State or Federal court. The parties hereby
consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such
parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of
process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in
the manner provided in Section 11(a) or in such other manner as may be
permitted by applicable law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.



(i) _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of
this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement
or document.



(j) _Additional Documents, Etc_. Stockholder shall execute and deliver any
additional documents necessary or desirable, in the reasonable opinion of
Acquiror, to carry out the purpose and



 

-6- intent of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality or effect of the
foregoing or any other obligation of Stockholder hereunder, Stockholder
hereby authorizes Acquiror to deliver a copy of this Agreement to the Company
and hereby agrees that each of the Company and Acquiror may rely upon such
delivery as conclusively evidencing the waivers of Stockholder referred to in
Section 6.



(k) _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
