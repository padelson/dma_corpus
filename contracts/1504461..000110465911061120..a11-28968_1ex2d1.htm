 **ARTICLE II**

 

 **CONTRIBUTION**

 



 

2.1 _Consideration; Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions to closing set forth in _Article VI_, the closing (the " _Closing_
") of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be held at the
offices of Winston and Strawn LLP, 35 W. Wacker Drive,

 



      
 

 



 

Chicago, Illinois 60601 on the first Business Day of the first full calendar
month immediately following the date on which the satisfaction or waiver of
all of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than the conditions
that would normally be satisfied on the Closing Date) has occurred. The
Closing shall have been deemed to have occurred at 12:01 a.m., Chicago time,
on the Closing Date, or such other place, date and time as may be mutually
agreed upon in writing by SemStream and NGL. The " _Closing Date_ ," as
referred to herein, shall mean the date of the Closing.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, SemStream shall
contribute, sell, assign, convey, transfer and deliver to NGL Subsidiary, and
NGL Subsidiary shall acquire and purchase from SemStream, the Contributed
Assets, in each case free and clear of all Encumbrances of any kind, except
for Permitted Encumbrances, in exchange for the following aggregate
consideration (the " _Aggregate Consideration_ ") (as adjusted pursuant to
_Section 2.4_), which shall be paid as follows at the Closing:

 



 

(i) _Estimated Working Capital Adjustment_. Subject to subsection (iii) below,
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, SemStream shall deliver to NGL
Subsidiary a good faith estimate of the Net Working Capital Closing Statement
(" _Estimated Net Working Capital_ ") as of the Calculation Date. If the
Estimated Net Working Capital is _less_ than the Net Working Capital
Threshold, then SemStream shall pay to NGL Subsidiary at Closing an amount in
cash equal to such shortfall. If the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the
Net Working Capital Threshold by $25,000,000 or less (such excess amount, the
" _Initial Excess Amount_ "), then NGL shall issue an aggregate number of NGL
Common Units to SemStream equal to (A) such Initial Excess Amount _divided_
_by_ (B) $20.00 (the " _Additional NGL Units_ "). In the event the Estimated
Net Working Capital exceeds the Net Working Capital Threshold by more than
$25,000,000, then NGL shall issue the Additional NGL Units to SemStream and
NGL Subsidiary shall pay to SemStream at Closing an amount in cash equal to
the amount by which Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds $25,000,000;
_provided_ , notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Estimated Net
Working Capital is greater than $125,000,000, then, at the sole election of
NGL, the parties shall work together in good faith to identify Inventory that
SemStream will retain and not assign hereunder (and exclude from the
calculation of Estimated Net Working Capital) so that the Estimated Net
Working Capital is equal to or less than $125,000,000 (or such higher amount
as consented to by NGL in its sole discretion). Any such excluded Inventory
will constitute Retained Assets hereunder. Any such cash payment by NGL
Subsidiary is made hereunder to reimburse SemStream for capital expenditures
with respect to Inventory contributed by SemStream to NGL Subsidiary hereunder
and shall be treated as such by the Parties for all financial and Tax
reporting purposes (including without limitation for purposes of Treas. Reg.
Section 1.707-4(d)).

 



 

(ii) _Issuance of NGL Units by NGL to SemStream_. NGL shall issue, convey,
assign, transfer and deliver to SemStream, free and clear of any Encumbrances
(other than restrictions under applicable securities Laws), (a) 7,500,000 NGL
Common Units (as further described in the NGL LP Agreement) (the "
_Contribution NGL Units_ "), and (b) the Variable Units (the Contribution
Units, the Variable Units and the Additional NGL Units (if any), collectively,
the " _NGL Units_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) _Offset Amount_. At Closing, any cash amounts payable by NGL pursuant to
subsection (i) above shall be reduced by an aggregate equal to the Retained
Property Value (if any) (the " _Offset Amount_ "). In the event the Offset
Amount exceeds the aggregate cash amount to be paid by NGL pursuant to such
subsection (i) above, then at the Closing, SEM shall pay such excess amount to
NGL in cash (the " _Offset Payment_ ").

 



 

(iv) _Assumption of the Assumed Liabilities_. NGL Subsidiary shall assume the
Assumed Liabilities pursuant to an assumption agreement in the form attached
as _Exhibit G_ hereto (the " _Assumption Agreement_ ").

2.4 _Working Capital Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) Following the Closing Date, NGL Subsidiary shall cause to be prepared a
statement of the Net Working Capital of SemStream as of the Calculation Date
(the " _Net Working Capital Closing Statement_ "). The Net Working Capital
Closing Statement shall contain line item detail comparable to the balance
sheet included in the most recent Financial Statements with respect to the
components of the Net Working Capital of SemStream as of the Calculation Date.
No later than forty-five (45) days following the Closing, NGL Subsidiary shall
deliver to SemStream the Net Working Capital Closing Statement, together with
a worksheet showing the difference, if any, between the Net Working Capital
reflected therein and the Net Working Capital Threshold. SemStream shall have
a period of thirty (30) days following its receipt of the Net Working Capital
Closing Statement and related worksheet to provide written notice of its
objection to the Net Working Capital Closing Statement or the related
worksheet (which notice shall state the basis for SemStreams objection).
During the 30-day period following SemStreams receipt of the Net Working
Capital Closing Statement, the NGL Subsidiary shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the SemStream and its and its officers,
directors, principals, employees, advisors, auditors, agents, bankers and
other representatives (collectively, the " _Representatives_ ") with access to
the non-privileged working papers relating to the Net Working Capital Closing
Statement, and NGL Subsidiary shall cooperate with

 



      
 

 



 

SemStream and its Representatives to provide them with any other information
used in preparing the Net Working Capital Closing Statement reasonably
requested by SemStream and its Representatives. If, within such 30-day period,
SemStream has not given NGL Subsidiary written notice of its objection to the
Net Working Capital Closing Statement or the related worksheet, then the Net
Working Capital reflected therein shall be binding and conclusive on the
Parties and used in making the adjustment provided for in _Section 2.4(b)_.
If SemStream timely provides any such objection, SemStream and NGL Subsidiary
shall work in good faith to resolve any differences with respect thereto. If,
at the end of a 15-day period from the date of delivery of any objection by
SemStream there are any matters that remain in dispute, then NGL and SemStream
shall submit the remaining matters in dispute to the Referee within the
following five (5) Business Days for resolution. The Referee shall make a
determination with respect to the disputed matters submitted to it and
determine the Net Working Capital of SemStream as of the Calculation Date
within thirty (30) days after the objections that remain in dispute are
submitted to it. In making such determination, the Referee shall consider only
those items or amounts in NGL Subsidiarys calculation of Net Working Capital
as to which SemStream has disagreed. If any objections are submitted to the
Referee for resolution, (i) each Party shall furnish to the Referee such work
papers and other documents and information relating to such objections as the
Referee may request and are available to that Party (or its independent public
accountants or other representatives) and will be afforded the opportunity to
present to the Referee any material relating to the determination of the
matters in dispute and to discuss such determination with the Referee and (ii)
the determination by the Referee of the Net Working Capital of SemStream as of
the Calculation Date, as set forth in a written notice delivered to each of
SemStream and NGL Subsidiary by the Referee, shall be calculated in accordance
with the past practices utilized in preparing the most recent Financial
Statements, and shall be binding and conclusive on the Parties and, absent
manifest error, shall constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and
non-appealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having
jurisdiction thereof. The fees and expenses of the Referee shall be allocated
to and borne by NGL Subsidiary and SemStream based on the inverse of the
percentage that the Referees determination (before such allocation) bears to
the total amount of the total items in dispute as originally submitted to the
Referee. For example, should the items in dispute total in amount to $100,000
and the Referee awards $60,000 in favor of SemStreams position, 60% of the
costs of its review would be borne by NGL Subsidiary and 40% of the costs
would be borne by SemStream. The final Net Working Capital of SemStream as of
the Calculation Date, as determined in accordance with this _Section 2.4(a)_,
is referred to as the " _Final Net Working Capital_."

 



 

(b) If the Final Net Working Capital is _less_ than the Estimated Net Working
Capital (as determined and adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_), SemStream
shall pay NGL Subsidiary a cash amount equal to the amount of such shortfall.
If the Final Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital (as
determined and adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.1(a))_, NGL shall pay
SemStream the amount of such excess in cash.

 



 

2.5 _Retained Assets_. SemStream shall not contribute, sell, transfer, convey
or deliver to NGL Subsidiary, and NGL Subsidiary shall not acquire or purchase
from SemStream, the Retained Assets.

 



 

2.6 _Consideration Allocation_. Within sixty (60) days of the determination of
the Final Net Working Capital, NGL Subsidiary shall provide to SemStream a
proposed schedule

 



      
 

 



 

allocating the Aggregate Consideration (as adjusted pursuant to _Section
2.4(b)_ (and relevant Assumed Liabilities) among the Contributed Assets and
the non-compete obligation set forth in the Non-Competition Agreement (the "
_Consideration Allocation Schedule_ "). The Consideration Allocation Schedule
will be prepared in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Code. NGL
Subsidiary and SemStream shall make appropriate adjustments to the
Consideration Allocation Schedule to reflect any adjustments to Aggregate
Consideration or other relevant items. NGL Subsidiary and SemStream agree to
use commercially reasonable efforts to agree on the Consideration Allocation
Schedule and, if agreed, to report for all Tax reporting purposes the
transactions in accordance with the mutually agreed Consideration Allocation
Schedule, as appropriately adjusted. In the event NGL Subsidiary and SemStream
cannot agree on the Consideration Allocation Schedule each Party may allocate
the Aggregate Consideration for their respective separate Tax reporting
purposes in their discretion.

 



 

2.7 _Withholding_. NGL Subsidiary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amounts payable under this Agreement amounts that NGL Subsidiary is
required to deduct and withhold under the Code or other provision of any Tax
Law, provided, that at least ten (10) Business Days prior to Closing NGL
Subsidiary will notify SemStream of any such withholding that NGL Subsidiary
believes to be required and give SemStream an opportunity to demonstrate, if
it desires, that a lesser amount of withholding is required. All amounts
withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as being timely
paid.

 



 

2.8 _NGL Unit Adjustment_. The aggregate NGL Common Units issued pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)_ shall be subject to equitable adjustment in the event of any
unit split, unit dividend, reverse unit split or similar event affecting the
NGL Common Units after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date.

standing under the applicable Laws of its jurisdiction of formation with all
requisite power and authority (corporate or otherwise) to own, lease or
otherwise hold and operate the Contributed Assets and to carry on the Business
as presently conducted. SemStream is duly qualified and in good standing as a
foreign entity to do business in each jurisdiction in which the conduct or
nature of its business or the ownership, leasing, holding or operating of its
properties makes such qualification necessary, except such jurisdictions where
the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a SemStream
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) SemStream does not have any Subsidiary other than SemStream Arizona.
SemStream Arizona does not have any Subsidiary.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) SemStream has heretofore made available to NGL Subsidiary a complete and
correct copy of the limited partnership agreement of SemStream.

 



 

3.2 _Authority; No Violation; Consents and Approvals_.

transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly authorized by all requisite
action on the part of SemStream, and no other corporate, company, shareholder,
partnership or similar proceeding on the part of SemStream or any Affiliate
thereof is necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by SemStream and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the other
Parties, constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of SemStream,
enforceable against SemStream in accordance with its terms (except insofar as
such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws relating to or affecting
creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law)).

 



 

(c) None of the execution and delivery by SemStream of this Agreement, or the
consummation by SemStream of the transactions contemplated hereby, or the
performance by SemStream under this Agreement will (i) violate, conflict with
or result in a breach of any provision of the partnership agreement of
SemStream; (ii) other than as set forth on _Section 3.2(c)_ of the SEM
Disclosure Schedule, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit

material penalty; (iii) other than as set forth on _Section 3.2(c)_ of the
SEM Disclosure Schedule, require any consent or approval of any counterparty

give to others any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or
acceleration of any obligation or the loss of any benefit under, any Contract
or Permit to which SemStream is a party or any Contributed Assets bound; (iv)
result in the creation of an Encumbrance, other than a Permitted Encumbrance,

the absence of financial footnotes), have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except, in
the case of interim financial statements, for normal and recurring year-end
adjustments).

 



 

3.5 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. SemStream does not have any Liability of the
nature required to be disclosed in a balance sheet in accordance with GAAP
that is not shown on or provided for in the Financial Statements, other than
the Excluded Liabilities and Liabilities incurred or accrued in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice since March 31, 2011 and reflected in the
calculation of Net Working Capital pursuant to _Section 2.4_.

 



 

3.6 _Compliance with Applicable Laws; Permits_.

 



 

(a) SemStream is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
Laws. SemStream has not received any written communication from a Governmental

franchises, authorizations, licenses, permits, exemptions, consents,

force and effect, and SemStream has not received written notice that such
Permits will not be renewed in the ordinary course after Closing. Except as
set forth on _Section 3.6(b)_ of the SEM Disclosure Schedule, SemStream is

proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable.
Without limiting the foregoing but subject to the other terms of this
Agreement, the Parties agree that, from time to time, whether before, at or
after the Closing Date, each of them will execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, such instruments of assignment, transfer, conveyance,
endorsement, direction or authorization as may be necessary to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. After the
Closing, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
approvals or consents or assist in any filings required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are requested by NGL
Subsidiary and that have not been previously obtained or made.

 



 

5.8 _No Public Announcement_. Until the Closing, SemStream, on the one hand,
and the NGL Group Entities, on the other hand, shall consult with each other
before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment
upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no Party (or any Affiliate
thereof) shall issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such consultation and the consent of SemStream and NGL (on behalf of
the NGL Group Entities) (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as such Party may reasonably conclude is
required by applicable Law or court process; _provided_ , _however_ , in no
event shall any Party be liable or responsible for the content of any press
release or public statement issued or made by the other Party. The Parties
agree that, until Closing, all formal employee communication programs or
announcements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be in forms mutually agreed to by SemStream and NGL (on behalf of the
NGL Group Entities) (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld,

 



      
 

 



 

conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , however, that no further mutual
agreement shall be required with respect to any such programs or announcements
that implement programs or announcements previously announced in compliance
with this _Section 5.8_.

 



 

5.9 _Non-Transferable Contracts and Permits_.

 



 

(a) SemStream and NGL Subsidiary shall cooperate to obtain and deliver to NGL
Subsidiary at or prior to the Closing such consents as are required to allow
the assignment by SemStream to NGL Subsidiary of all right, title and interest
in, to and under any Contract or Permit included in the Contributed Assets. To
the extent any such Contract or Permit is not capable of being assigned
without the consent or waiver of the other party thereto or any Third Party
(including any Authority), or if such assignment or attempted assignment would
constitute a breach thereof or a violation of any Law or Order, this Agreement
shall not constitute an assignment or an attempted assignment of such
Contracts or Permits.

 



 

(b) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, SemStream is
not obligated to transfer to NGL Subsidiary any of its rights and obligations
in and to any Contract or Permit without first having obtained all necessary
consents and waivers. For the twelve (12) month period following the Closing
Date, SemStream shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and NGL
Subsidiary shall cooperate with SemStream (at SemStreams expense), to obtain
the consents and waivers referred to in _Section 5.9(a)_.

 



 

(c) To the extent that such consents and waivers are not obtained by
SemStream, this Agreement, to the extent permitted by Law, shall constitute an
equitable assignment by SemStream to NGL Subsidiary of all rights, benefits,
title and interest in and to such Contracts and Permits, and NGL Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be SemStreams agent or subcontractor, as applicable, for
the purpose of completing, fulfilling and discharging all of SemStreams
rights and liabilities arising after the Closing Date under such Contracts and
Permits. SemStream shall take all commercially reasonable steps and actions to
provide (or have its agents and subcontractors provide) NGL Subsidiary with
the proceeds and benefits of such Contracts and Permits and NGL Subsidiary
shall be obligated for all liabilities under such Contracts and Permits which
shall be treated as Assumed Liabilities hereunder. At NGLs direction,
SemStream shall instruct any Third-Party to such Contract that any payments
owing to SemStream under such Contract from such Third-Party shall be made to
an account designated by NGL.

this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including Transaction Expenses of such Party.

 



 

5.11 _Control of Other Party s Business_. Prior to the Closing Date, each of
the Parties will exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its respective operations and
the operations of its respective Subsidiaries. Nothing in this Agreement,
including any of the actions, rights or restrictions set forth herein, will be
interpreted in such a way as to require any Party to violate any rule,
regulation or policy

 



      
 

 



 

of any Governmental Entity or applicable Law, relating to the control of
another Party (other than each such Partys Subsidiaries and Affiliates).

 



 

5.12 _Insurance Arrangements_. Between the Execution Date and the earlier to
occur of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement, and except as
otherwise consented to in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed) by all of the Parties, SemStream shall not
take any action or fail to take any commercially reasonable action if such
action or inaction, as the case may be, would materially adversely affect the
applicability of any insurance in effect on the Execution Date that covers all
or any part of the Contributed Assets or the Business.

 



 

5.13 _Audited Financial Statements_. No later than fourteen (14) days after
the Closing Date, SemStream will cause to be prepared and delivered to NGL
audited financial statements of SemStream prepared by the auditing firm of
BDO, USA, LLP in accordance with Regulation S-X and meeting the requirements
of Item 9.01 of Form 8-K of the Exchange Act and unaudited financial
statements of SemStream for any interim periods following such audited periods
included therein. SemStream, will, to the extent required by applicable
securities Laws, allow NGL to use such financial statements in NGLs filings

5.14 **Intentionally Deleted.**

 



 

5.15 _Real Property Matters_.

 



 

(a) SemStream shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with NGL
Subsidiary so that prior to the Closing Date, NGL Subsidiary shall have

(viii) waiver of arbitration, (ix) utilities availability and (x) access;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) an ALTA Land Title Survey (a " _Survey_ ") for each parcel of Real

Strawn LLP and any other parties designated by NGL Subsidiary; and

 



 

(b) SemStream and NGL shall each pay fifty percent (50%) of the costs and
expenses of the Title Commitments and Surveys, whether or not the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement are consummated; and, at Closing, SemStream
and NGL shall each pay fifty percent (50%) the costs and expenses of the Title
Policies (other than extended coverage and endorsements thereto) and any and
all title search, escrow and closing fees charged by the Title Company in
connection with the Closing. NGL Subsidiary shall pay any incremental premiums
for extended coverage under the Title Policies or any endorsements thereto.

 



 

5.16 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) SemStream shall timely pay all Excluded Taxes and shall indemnify and hold
NGL Subsidiary harmless from all Excluded Taxes.

 



 

(b) All Transfer Taxes shall be paid when due by SemStream and NGL Subsidiary
will reimburse SemStream for one-half (50%) of the cost thereof.

 



 

(c) All refunds for Taxes attributable to the Contributed Assets, the
Transferred Employees or the Business for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (and one-
half (50%) of all refunds for Transfer Taxes) shall be for the benefit of
SemStream; _provided_ , _however_ , any refund for any such Tax that NGL
Subsidiary paid that SemStream has not indemnified for under this Agreement
(or reserved as a Net Working Capital Closing Statement included in the Final
Net Working Capital) shall be for the benefit of NGL Subsidiary. To the extent
NGL Subsidiary receives a refund that is for the benefit of SemStream, NGL
Subsidiary shall promptly pay the amount of such refund to SemStream (without
interest, other than interest received from the applicable Governmental
Entity, and net of any out-of-pocket costs or Taxes incurred by NGL Subsidiary
with respect to obtaining such refund). All refunds for Taxes attributable to
NGL Subsidiary Assets, the Transferred Employees or the Business for any Post-
Closing Tax Period shall be for the benefit of NGL Subsidiary. To the extent
SemStream receives a refund that is for the benefit of NGL Subsidiary,
SemStream shall promptly pay the amount of such refund to NGL Subsidiary
(without interest, other than interest received from the applicable
Governmental Authority, and net of any out-of-pocket costs or Taxes incurred
by SemStream with respect to obtaining such refund).

 



 

(d) If any Tax (or Tax refund) relates to a period that begins before and ends
after the Closing Date, the parties shall use the following conventions for
determining the portion of such Tax (or Tax refund) that relate to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period and which relates to a Post-Closing Tax Period: (A) in the
case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a

 



      
 

 



 

periodic basis, the amount of Taxes (or Tax refunds) attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be determined by multiplying the Taxes for the entire
period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in
the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of calendar days in the entire period, and the remaining
amount of such Taxes (or Tax refunds) shall be attributable to the Post-
Closing Tax Period; and (B) in the case of all other Taxes, the amount of
Taxes (or Tax refunds) attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
determined as if a separate return was filed for the period ending as of the
end of the day on the Closing Date using a "closing of the books methodology,"
and the remaining amount of the Taxes (or Tax refunds) for such period shall
be attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period.

 



 

(e) NGL Subsidiary and SemStream shall (i) assist in the preparation and
timely filing of any Tax Return (including any claim for a Tax refund); (ii)
assist in any audit or other proceeding with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns;
(iii) make available any information, records, or other documents relating to
any Taxes or Tax Returns; (iv) provide any information required to allow NGL
Subsidiary to comply with any information reporting or withholding
requirements contained in the Code or other applicable Tax Laws; and (v)
provide certificates or forms, and timely execute any Tax Return that are
necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption for (or reduction in) any
Transfer Tax. Without limiting the foregoing, on or prior to the Closing,
SemStream shall provide to NGL Subsidiary a schedule that sets forth (i) the
adjusted tax basis in each Contributed Asset (as determined immediately prior
to Closing) and (ii) the depreciation life, method, conventions and history of
each such asset (the " _Tax Basis Schedule_ ").

 



 

(f) SemStream and the NGL Group Entities agree that the allocation of the
assets contributed by SemStream to each of NGL Subsidiary and Holdings,
respectively, in exchange for the consideration to be received by SemStream
from NGL Subsidiary and Holdings, respectively, as set forth in _Section
2.1(a)_ and _Section 2.1(d)_, reflects the fair market value of the assets
contributed and received. For all Tax reporting purposes, SemStream and each
of NGL and Holdings agree to report the transactions in accordance with such
allocation and agreed fair market value. Holdings agrees that to the extent
the "gross asset value" (as defined in the Holdings LLC Agreement) of any
Holdings asset is increased as a result of SemStreams contribution of cash to
Holdings pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_, the increase will not exceed the
amount contributed by SemStream as set forth in _Section 2.1(d)_ [i.e.,
$22,500], as appropriately adjusted to reflect SemStreams percentage
ownership of membership interests in Holdings.

 



 

(g) For purposes of Holdings making allocations of items income, gain, loss,
deduction and credit that take into account the varying percentage membership
interests in Holdings in calendar year 2011 resulting from the issuance of the
Holdings Interests, Holdings shall adopt a closing of the books method.

 



 

5.17 _Phase I Reports_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, SemStream covenants and agrees to cooperate in good
faith with NGL so as to allow NGL to obtain (at NGLs sole cost and expense)
Phase I Reports for each parcel of Real Property prior to Closing, in form and
substance satisfactory to

 



      
 

 



 

NGL. SemStream reserves the right to engage its own environmental consultant,
reasonably acceptable to NGL (whose approval shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed), to perform Phase I activities and review
the results of NGLs environmental consultants Phase I Report. In the event
that NGLs environmental consultants Phase I Report for any parcel of Owned
Real Property recommends that a Phase II be performed for such parcel of Owned
Real Property, NGL shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to exclude
such parcel of Owned Real Property from the Contributed Assets at Closing and
such parcel shall be a "Retained Parcel" and constitute a "Retained Asset". In
the event NGL elects to exclude such parcel at Closing, the parties covenant
and agree to enter into a lease agreement with respect to such parcel pursuant
to commercially reasonable terms and at fair market value, which shall include
an option to purchase such parcel at the applicable Retained Property Value
and provide for a ten (10) year term with two optional extensions of ten (10)
years each.

 



 

(b) Any obligation of NGL to purchase a Retained Parcel shall be conditioned
upon SemStream engaging an environmental consultant to perform a Phase II
investigation, and, in the event the Phase II investigation identifies
Environmental Conditions which would require investigative, monitoring,
remedial or corrective actions pursuant to Environmental Law (" _Remedial
Actions_ "), SemStream performing (and paying for) any required Remedial
Actions identified in the Phase II report in accordance with applicable Law.

 



 

5.18 _Compliance Audits_. Prior to the Closing, and without limitation of the
provisions of _Section 5.2_ hereof, SemStream covenants and agrees to
cooperate in good faith with NGL so as to allow NGL and its agents (at NGLs
cost and expense) to perform a physical inspection of the Real Property
identified on _Section 5.18_ of the NGL Disclosure Schedule and deliver a
report setting forth safety, compliance and engineering recommendations with
respect thereto (an " _Compliance Audit Report_ "). In the event any such
Compliance Audit Report identifies safety, compliance or engineering
deficiencies requiring correction or remediation so as to bring such facility
into material compliance with applicable Law, SemStream covenants and agrees
to perform such corrective or remedial actions identified in the Compliance
Audit Report as promptly as practical at SemStreams sole cost and expense;
provided, however, SemStream shall have the right to consult in good faith
with an engineering consultant to confirm such recommendations.

 



 

5.19 _Use of Names and Website_.

 



 

(a) SemStream is not conveying or granting to NGL Subsidiary or its Affiliates
any ownership right in, or any license to use, any trade names, trademarks,
service marks, logos, domain names or any other source designators (including
the name "SemStream" or any trade name, trademark, service mark, logo, domain
name or other source designator incorporating, or confusingly similar to, the
name "SemStream") of SemStream or any Affiliate of SemStream or any word that
is confusingly similar in sound or appearance to such marks (collectively, the
" _SemStream Marks_ " ) and, after the Closing, NGL Subsidiary shall not use
SemStream Marks in any manner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SemStream hereby
consents to the use of the name "SemStream" and the "SemStream" logo, and any
trade name, trademark, service mark, logo, domain name or any other source
designator incorporating the name "SemStream" by NGL Subsidiary from the
Closing Date through December 31, 2012 in connection with the Business.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) SemStream shall ensure that anyone that navigates or links to
"http://www.semstream.com/" at any time during the first six months following
the Closing will be automatically redirected to www.nglenergypartners.com or
any other World Wide Web site designated by NGL Subsidiary.

 



 

5.20 _Termination of Letters of Credit_. NGL Subsidiary shall take all actions
necessary to cause the termination of all letters of credit which SemStream is
responsible or liable for payment and disclosed on _Section 5.20_ of the SEM
Disclosure Schedule (as updated pursuant to _Section 5.25_) on or prior to
the Closing Date.

 



 

5.21 _Transition Services Agreement_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith a more detailed description of services (and
associated fees) to be provided by SemStream pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement, which will be materially consistent with the summary
description of services (and associated fees) in the form of Transition
Services Agreement.

 



 

5.22 _Refunds and Remittances_.

 



 

(a) If after the Closing any SEM Group Entity receives any amount which is a
Contributed Asset or is otherwise properly due and owing to any NGL Group
Entity under this Agreement, such SEM Group Entity shall promptly remit, or
shall cause to be remitted, such amount to such NGL Group Entity.

 



 

(b) If after the Closing any of the NGL Group Entities receives any amount
which is a Retained Asset or is otherwise properly due and owing to any SEM
Group Entity under this Agreement, including, without limitation, any Accounts
Receivable, such NGL Group Entity shall promptly remit (and with respect to
Accounts Receivable, such remittance shall occur on a weekly basis), or shall
cause to be remitted, such NGL Group Entity shall promptly remit, or shall
cause to be remitted, such amount to such SEM Group Entity. Further, after the
Closing, the NGL Group Entities shall, at their expense, bill and collect any
Accounts Receivable that are Retained Assets on behalf of SemStream.

 



 

5.23 _NGL Interim Conduct_. NGL covenants and agrees that from the Execution
Date to the Closing Date:

 



 

(a) in the event NGL enters into any transaction other than in the ordinary
course of business, such transaction (i) shall be approved by the board of
directors of NGL in advance and (ii) shall not result in NGL ceasing to be
treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes;

 



 

(b) without the prior written consent of SemStream (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), merge into or with any other
Person (other than (A) mergers among wholly owned subsidiaries of the same
Person or (B) as permitted by clause (c));

 



 

(c) amend or otherwise change the NGL LP Agreement or the Holdings LLC
Agreement other than to effectuate the transactions contemplated herein or
otherwise disclosed

 



      
 

 



 

to SemStream pursuant to the Information Statement or in connection with any
acquisition disclosed in the NGL SEC Reports;

 



 

(d) declare, set aside, make or pay any dividend or other distribution,
payable in cash, stock, property or otherwise, or make any other payment on or
with respect to any of its capital stock except for (i) dividends by any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of NGL to NGL or (ii) ordinary
course quarterly cash dividend from available cash (and not the result of an
extraordinary transaction);

 



 

(e) reclassify, combine, split, subdivide or redeem, or purchase or otherwise
acquire, directly or indirectly, any of its partnership interests or other
transaction with a similar effect; or

unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), adopt a plan of complete or
partial liquidation, dissolution, merger, consolidation, restructuring,
recapitalization or other reorganization of NGL or other transaction with a
similar effect.

 



 

5.24 _Distribution Waiver_. SemStream covenants and agrees, as a condition
precedent to the performance of NGL Subsidiarys obligations hereunder, that
it shall execute and deliver at Closing a waiver and forbearance agreement in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to NGL providing for the following:

 



 

(a) in the event the Closing occurs on or prior to the fifteenth (15th) day of
any fiscal quarter of NGL, SemStream shall waive any right to receive any
distribution declared and paid by NGL in such fiscal quarter in the ordinary
course of business from available cash as of the end of the prior fiscal
quarter (and not the result of an extraordinary transaction) (but shall be
entitled to receive its full share of any distribution declared and paid in
the immediately following fiscal quarter of NGL);

 



 

(b) in the event the Closing occurs after the fifteenth (15th) day of any
fiscal quarter of NGL, SemStream shall waive any right to receive any
distribution declared and paid by NGL in such fiscal quarter in the ordinary
course of business from available cash as of the end of the prior fiscal
quarter (and not the result of an extraordinary transaction) (but shall be
entitled to receive its partial pro rata share (as hereafter defined) of any
distribution declared and paid in the immediately following fiscal quarter of
NGL). For purposes hereof, "partial pro rata share" shall mean the aggregate
consecutive days that SemStream owned NGL Units during such fiscal quarter in
which the Closing occurred divided by the aggregate number of days in such
fiscal quarter; and

 



 

(c) without limitation of, and in addition to, the obligations set forth in
subsections (a) and (b) above, SemStream shall, solely with respect to an

5.25 _Updating of Disclosure Schedules_. In the event of any action, event,
occurrence or circumstance arising in the ordinary course of business
consistent, if applicable, with past practices following the date hereof which
results in the breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of
SemStream or NGL Subsidiary set forth in _Article III_ or _Article IV_,
respectively, the applicable Party shall promptly notify the other Party of
such breach or inaccuracy and shall have been deemed to have amended such
Partys Disclosure Schedules by giving such written notice to the other Party
thereof. In any such event, the notifying Partys liability for inaccuracy or
breach of any representation or warranty set forth herein after the Closing
Date shall be determined by reference to such Partys Disclosure Schedules at
the time of the Closing after giving effect to any such changes.

 



 

5.26 _Securities Restrictions_.

 



 

(a) SemStream agrees not to, and to cause its Affiliates not to, directly or

(ii) except as otherwise agreed by Holdings, transfer any legal or beneficial
interest in the NGL Units prior to the occurrence of the "payable date" for
the quarterly distribution declared and made in connection with the fiscal
quarter in which the Closing Date occurs; or

 



 

(iii) transfer any legal or beneficial interest in the Distribution Waiver

without the consent of NGL or Holdings, respectively.

 



 

5.27 _Pledge and Transfer Consent and Waiver_.

 



 

(a) NGL and Holdings each covenant and agree, as a condition precedent to the
performance of SemStreams obligations hereunder, that they each shall execute
and deliver at Closing an acknowledgement, consent and/or waiver, as
applicable, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to SemStream,
providing that SemStreams pledge of its NGL Units to the agent under its
credit facility as collateral, and any subsequent transfer of its NGL Units
upon foreclosure or default, will not be treated by NGL or Holdings as a
violation of the restrictions on transfer applicable to such NGL Units herein
or pursuant to the NGL LP Agreement, provided,

 



      
 

 



 

however, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Parties acknowledge and agree
that such transfer restrictions shall remain applicable to the holders or

contained in the Holdings LLC Agreement will be waived such that none of such
restrictions shall be applicable to SemStreams pledge of its Holdings
Interests to the agent under its credit agreement as collateral, nor any

however, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Parties acknowledge and agree
that such transfer restrictions shall remain applicable to the holders or
transferees of such NGL Units and NGL shall receive a written acknowledgement
of the same from such holders or transferees; and

 



 

(d) Holdings covenants and agrees, as a condition precedent to the performance
of SemStreams obligations hereunder, that it shall cause, in documentation
executed and delivered at Closing, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to SemStream, that the restrictions on transfer, rights of first
refusal, tag along and drag along rights, and similar rights and restrictions
contained in the Holdings LLC Agreement will be waived such that none of such
restrictions shall be applicable to SemStreams transfer of its Holdings
Interests to any Affiliate, provided, however, for the avoidance of doubt,
that the Parties acknowledge and agree that all such restrictions shall remain
applicable to the holders or transferees of such Holdings Interests and NGL
shall receive a written acknowledgement of the same from such holders or
transferees.

and take reasonably necessary steps to prevent any transfers of NGL Units or
other securities issued by NGL in respect of any NGL Units by SemStream and
its Affiliates in violation of _Section 5.26_, including issuing stop

OPINION OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO THE PARTNERSHIP THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT
REQUIRED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR THE SUBMISSION OF SUCH OTHER EVIDENCE
SATISFACTORY TO THE PARTNERSHIP TO THE EFFECT THAT ANY SUCH TRANSFER SHALL NOT
BE IN VIOLATION OF THE SECURITIES ACT.

 



 

5.29 _Holdings Interim Conduct_. Holdings covenants and agrees that from the
Execution Date to the Closing Date:

 



 

(a) in the event Holdings enters into any transaction other than in the
ordinary course of business, such transaction (i) shall be approved by the
board of directors of Holdings in advance and (ii) shall not result in
Holdings ceasing to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes;

 



 

(b) without the prior written consent of SemStream (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), merge into or with any other
Person (other than (A) mergers among wholly owned subsidiaries of the same
Person or (B) as permitted by clause (c));

 



 

(c) declare, set aside, make or pay any dividend or other distribution,

under:

 



 

(i) a breach of the SemStream Fundamental Representations; _provided, however_
, that solely for purposes of this _Section 7.2(a)(i)_, in determining
whether there has occurred a breach of any such representation or warranty,
the provisions of such representations and warranties shall be read and

THIS INDEMNIFICATION IS EXPRESSLY INTENDED TO APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY
NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE) OR OTHER FAULT OR

pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ is subject to the following limitations:

 



 

(i) In no event shall SemStreams aggregate obligation to indemnify the NGL
Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ and ( _ii_ ) exceed

Indemnified Parties under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ or ( _ii_ ) exceeds $1,500,000
(the " _SEM Deductible_ "); _provided, however_ , that once the amount of such
Damages suffered exceeds the SEM Deductible, SemStream shall be obligated to
indemnify the NGL Indemnified Parties only to the extent that such Damages
exceed, and only in amounts that exceed, the SEM Deductible; _provided,
further_ , in no event shall the SEM Deductible be applicable to any claim for
fraud, intentional misrepresentation, or intentional breach.

pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ only for those claims giving rise to Damages of

if any. Any written notice delivered by a NGL Indemnified Party to SemStream
with respect to Damages of the NGL Indemnified Parties shall set forth with as
much specificity as is reasonably practicable the basis of the claim for
Damages of the NGL Indemnified Parties and, to the extent reasonably
practicable, a reasonable estimate of the amount thereof. Notwithstanding

Survival Period shall not be applicable with respect to any claim for Damages
arising for fraud, intentional misrepresentation or intentional breach.

Closing, NGL shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless SemStream and its

Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against all Damages asserted against or
incurred by (or reasonably likely to be incurred by) any SEM Indemnified Party
as a result of or arising out of:

 



 

(i) a breach of any NGL Fundamental Representation _provided, however_ , that
solely for purposes of this _Section 7.3(a)(i)_, in determining whether there
has occurred a breach of any such representation or warranty, the provisions
of such representations and warranties shall be read and interpreted as if the

(b) The obligation of NGL to indemnify the SEM Indemnified Parties pursuant to

(i) In no event shall NGLs aggregate obligation to indemnify the SEM

a claim for fraud, intentional misrepresentation or intentional breach.

 



 

(ii) NGL shall have no obligation or liability under _Section 7.3(a)(i)_ and

7.3(a)(i)_ and ( _ii_ ) exceeds $1,500,000 (the " _NGL Deductible_ ");
_provided, however_ , that once the amount of such Damages suffered exceeds
the NGL Deductible, NGL shall be obligated to indemnify the SEM Indemnified
Parties only to the extent that such Damages exceed, and only in amounts that
exceed, the NGL Deductible; _provided, further_ , in no event shall the

 



      
 

 



 

NGL Deductible be applicable to any claim for fraud, intentional
misrepresentation, or intentional breach.

 



 

(iii) NGL shall be obligated to indemnify the SEM Indemnified Parties pursuant

(iv) NGL shall have no obligation or liability for breaches of _Section 5.23_
to the extent NGL had no Knowledge of any such event described therein.

 



 

7.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice of the
commencement of any action, such Indemnified Party shall, if a claim in
respect thereof is to be made against the Indemnifying Party under this
_Article VII_, notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of the commencement
thereof; but the omission so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve it from any liability which it may have to any Indemnified Party
otherwise than under this _Article VII_. In case any such action shall be
brought against any Indemnified Party and it shall notify the Indemnifying
Party of the commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any
other Indemnifying Party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof,
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party (who shall not,
except with the consent of the Indemnified Party, be counsel to the
Indemnifying Party), and, after notice from the Indemnifying Party to such
Indemnified Party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party under this
_Article VII_ for any legal expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party or
any other expenses of the Indemnified Party, in each case subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Party, in connection with the defense thereof
other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the Indemnifying Party fails
to notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days that the Indemnifying
Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 7.4_,
or if the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant
to this _Section 7.4_ but fails diligently to prosecute the proceedings
related to such claim as herein provided then the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to defend, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnified Party (if
the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder), such claim by
all appropriate proceedings. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), effect the settlement or compromise of, or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or
threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution
may be sought under this _Article VII_ (whether or not the Indemnified Party
is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such
settlement,

 



      
 

 



 

compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and
(ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault,
culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party.

 



 

(b) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve a third-party claim, the
Indemnified Party shall transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written notice
(the " _Indemnity Notice_ ") describing in reasonable detail the nature of the
claim, an estimate of the amount of damages attributable to such claim to the
extent feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of
such claim) and the basis of the Indemnified Partys request for
indemnification under this Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party does not
notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days from its receipt of the
Indemnity Notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim, the claim
specified by the Indemnified Party in the Indemnity Notice shall be deemed a
liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party
provides notice within such time period that it disputes the claim, the
Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional
advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the
claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the
claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Partys
investigation by giving such information and assistance (including access to
the Indemnified Partys premises and personnel and the right to examine and
copy any accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of
its professional advisors may reasonably request.

 



 

(c) In determining the amount of any Damages for which the Indemnified Party
is entitled to indemnification under this _Article VII_, the gross amount of
the indemnification will be reduced by (i) any insurance proceeds actually
received by the Indemnified Party and (ii) all amounts actually recovered by
the Indemnified Party under contractual indemnities from third Persons.

 



 

(d) The date on which notification of a claim for indemnification is received
as provided in _Section 9.1_ by the Indemnifying Party shall determine
whether such claim is timely made.

 



 

7.5 _No Duplication_. Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. In this regard, there shall
be no duplication of recovery under _Article VII_.

 



 

7.6 _Exclusive Remedies_.

 



 

(a) Except as provided in _Section 5.2_ and _Section 8.3_ and except with
respect to claims or causes of action arising from fraud or willful misconduct
or for breach of the Ancillary Agreements, the Parties agree that, from and
after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of any Party or their
respective Affiliates with respect to this Agreement or any other claims
relating to the events giving rise to this Agreement and the transactions
provided for herein or contemplated hereby (including the Bill of Sale and
Assignment Agreement) shall be limited to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this _Article VII_.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) The Parties intend that the indemnification procedures and limitations
contained in _Section 7.4_, _Section 7.5_ and _Section 7.7_ shall not apply
to the indemnity obligations of the parties in _Section 5.2_.

 



 

7.7 _Recourse against SemStream_. Any claims for indemnification against
SemStream shall be paid in cash by SemStream. The obligations of SemStream
under this _Article VII_ shall be guaranteed by the Limited Partner pursuant
to the terms and conditions of the Parent Guaranty. Any claims for
indemnification against NGL shall be paid in cash by NGL. Any payments made by
NGL hereunder shall be increased to account for SemStreams ownership in NGL
by multiplying the payment due by a fraction the numerator of which shall be
the total number of NGL Common Units outstanding and the denominator of which
shall be the total number of NGL Common Units outstanding and not owned by
SemStream or its Affiliates.

 



 

7.8 _No Exemplary or Punitive Damages_. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE
UNDER THIS _ARTICLE VII_ OR OTHERWISE IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR
EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH PARTY SUFFERS
SUCH DAMAGES TO AN UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH A THIRD-PARTY
CLAIM, IN WHICH EVENT SUCH DAMAGES SHALL BE RECOVERABLE.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII 
TERMINATION**

 



 

8.1 _Termination of Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby may be
terminated at any time before the Closing as follows:

 



 

(a) By the mutual written agreement of each of SemStream and NGL;

 



 

(b) By either SemStream or NGL if any Governmental Entity shall have issued a
final and nonappealable order, injunction or other legal restraint permanently
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by _Article II_ of this Agreement, _provided_ that the Party
seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall
have complied with its obligations in _Section 5.6_ in all material respects;

 



 

(c) By SemStream if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or
agreements or any inaccuracy of any of the representations or warranties set
forth in this Agreement on the part of the NGL Subsidiary, which breach or
inaccuracy, either individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if
occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, a failure of the conditions set
forth in _Section 6.2_ that is not capable of being satisfied or cured by the
End Date and has not been cured by NGL within ten (10) days of NGLs receipt
of written notice thereof from SemStream;

 



 

(d) By NGL if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or
agreements or any inaccuracy of any of the representations or warranties set
forth in this Agreement on the part of SemStream, which breach or inaccuracy,
either individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if occurring or
continuing on the Closing Date, a failure of the

 



      
 

 



 

conditions set forth in _Section 6.3_ that is not capable of being satisfied
or cured by the End Date and has not been cured by SemStream within ten (10)
days of SemStreams receipt of written notice thereof from NGL; or

 



 

(e) By NGL or SemStream, if the transactions contemplated this Agreement shall
not have been consummated on or prior to January 15, 2012 (the " _End Date_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_ shall not be available to any such Party
whose failure to perform or observe in any material respect any of its
obligations under this Agreement proximately caused the failure to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on or before the End Date.

 



 

8.2 _Effect of Certain Terminations_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to this _Article VIII_, all rights and obligations of the
Parties under this Agreement shall terminate, except the provisions of
_Section 5.2_, _Section 5.10_, _Section 5.11_, _Article VIII_ and _Article
IX_ shall survive such termination; _provided, however_ , that nothing herein
shall relieve any Party from any liability for any intentional or willful and
material breach by such Party of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement and all rights and
remedies of a non-breaching Party under this Agreement in the case of such
intentional or willful and material breach, at law or in equity, shall be
preserved.

 



 

8.3 _Enforcement of this Agreement_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that an
award of money damages would be inadequate for any breach of this Agreement by
any Party and any such breach would cause the non-breaching Parties
irreparable harm. Accordingly, the Parties agree that prior to the termination
of this Agreement, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this
Agreement by one of the Parties, the Parties to the fullest extent permitted
by law, will also be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or
other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific
performance, _provided_ such Party is not in material default hereunder. Such
remedies will not be the exclusive remedies for any breach of this Agreement
but will be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to
each of the Parties.

9.3 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement, the exhibits
and schedules hereto and the Transaction Documents constitute the entire
agreement between and among the Parties pertaining to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements, understandings,
negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties, and
there are no warranties, representations or other agreements between or among
the Parties in connection with the subject matter hereof except as set forth
specifically herein or contemplated hereby. Except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement, the SEM Disclosure Schedule, the NGL Disclosure Schedule and
in any agreement delivered pursuant to _Section 2.1_ hereof (including the
representations and warranties set forth in _Articles III_ and _IV_ ), (i) the
Parties acknowledge and agree that none of the Parties or any other Person has
made, and the Parties are not relying upon, any covenant, representation or
warranty, written or oral, statutory, expressed or implied, as to the SEM
Group Entities or the NGL Group Entities, as applicable, or as to the accuracy
or completeness of any information regarding any Party furnished or made
available to any other Party and (ii) no Party shall have or be subject to any
liability to any other Person, or any other remedy in connection herewith,
based upon the distribution to any other Person of, or any other

 



      
 

 



 

Persons use of or reliance on, any such information or any information,
documents or material made available to such Person in any "data rooms,"
"virtual data rooms," management presentations or in any other form in
expectation of, or in connection with, the transactions contemplated hereby.
No supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding
unless executed in writing by the Party to be bound thereby. The failure of a
Party to exercise any right or remedy shall not be deemed or constitute a
waiver of such right or remedy in the future. No waiver of any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of
any other provision hereof (regardless of whether similar), nor shall any such
waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.

 



 

9.4 _Binding Effect and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors
and assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any rights, benefits or obligations hereunder, except
as set forth in _Article VII_. No Party hereto may assign, transfer, dispose
of or otherwise alienate this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement (whether by operation of Law or otherwise),
_provided_ , _however_ , that NGL Subsidiary may assign or transfer all or any
part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (a) to any Person that
is wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by NGL Subsidiary or is an Affiliate
of NGL Subsidiary or (b) after the Closing, to any Person to whom NGL
Subsidiary sells all or substantially all the Contributed Assets; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that at any time any Party may collaterally assign its rights
hereunder to any Person or Persons providing financing to such Party in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Any attempted
assignment, transfer, disposition or alienation in violation of this Agreement
shall be null, void and ineffective.

 



 

9.5 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable such term or provision as to any other
jurisdiction or any of the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement in
that or any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad
as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so
broad as is enforceable.

 



 

9.6 _Risk of Loss_. Risk of loss, damage or destruction to the Contributed
Assets shall be upon SemStream until the Closing and shall thereafter be upon
NGL Subsidiary.

 



 

9.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute
one instrument.
