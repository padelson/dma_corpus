respective representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and premises
contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:    E-8  9   ARTICLE I  PURCHASE AND SALE   SECTION 1.1
PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES.   (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Parent shall cause Seller to

free and clear of any Encumbrance and Purchaser shall purchase, acquire and
accept from Seller, all of Seller\'s right, title and interest in and to all

pursuant to SECTION 1.2 hereof, as adjusted pursuant to SECTION 1.3
hereof.   SECTION 1.2 CLOSING PAYMENT. On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
pay to Seller an aggregate amount of Three Hundred Thirty Million
Dollars (USD $330,000,000) in cash LESS the Estimated Working Capital
Adjustment Amount, if any (the "CLOSING PAYMENT") (together with the Canadian
Purchase Price (as defined in the Canadian Purchase Agreement) and as finally
adjusted pursuant to SECTION 1.4 and SECTION 5.2, the "PURCHASE PRICE").
Purchaser shall deliver the Closing Payment to Seller by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to Seller Bank Account.   SECTION 1.3 ESTIMATED
CLOSING BALANCE SHEET. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date Seller shall:   (a) Prepare the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet
and deliver it to Purchaser.   (b) Prepare and deliver to Purchaser a
written estimate, based on the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet, of the
Net Working Capital of the New Group as of the Closing Date (the "ESTIMATED
CLOSING NET WORKING CAPITAL"). If the Target Net Working Capital exceeds the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, such difference shall be the
"ESTIMATED WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT" (which shall otherwise be
zero). "NET WORKING Capital" shall have the meaning set forth and be
determined pursuant to the methodologies set forth on SCHEDULE 1.3(B) of this
Agreement.   (c) The Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet and
the calculations made pursuant to SECTION 1.3 (b) above shall be certified
to Purchaser by the Chief Financial Officer of Parent as having been prepared
in good faith.   SECTION 1.4 POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS.   (a) CLOSING DATE
BALANCE SHEET. Within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall, solely for the purpose of this Agreement, (i) prepare or cause to be
prepared and delivered to Seller an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of
the New Group as of    E-9  10 the Closing Date in accordance with GAAP
consistent with the accounting principles and practices applied in
preparation of the 2000 Unaudited Financial Statements (the "CLOSING DATE
BALANCE SHEET") and (ii) prepare or cause to be prepared from the Closing
Date Balance Sheet a Schedule of Net Working Capital of the New Group as of
the Closing Date (the "CLOSING NET WORKING CAPITAL") prepared in accordance
with SCHEDULE 1.3(b) and (iii) shall cause a copy of the Schedule of Net
Working Capital to be delivered to Seller together with a report thereon of
Purchaser\'s accountants stating that the Closing Net Working Capital was
determined in accordance with the methodologies set forth on SCHEDULE
1.3(b) hereof.   (b) STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS. Unless Seller provides
written notice to Purchaser setting forth in reasonable detail its good faith
objection to any portion of the Closing Date Balance Sheet relating to the
calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital on the basis that such portion
shall not have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistent with the
accounting principles and practices applied in preparation of the 2000
Unaudited Financial Statements and/or that the Closing Net Working Capital
was not calculated in accordance with the methodologies set forth on SCHEDULE
1.3(b) of this Agreement (the "STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS") prior to the close
of business on the forty-fifth (45th) day following the receipt by Seller of
the Closing Date Balance Sheet from Purchaser (the "OBJECTION PERIOD"), the
Closing Date Balance Sheet (and the Closing Net Working Capital reflected in
and calculated from such Closing Date Balance Sheet) shall thereafter be
binding upon Seller and its Affiliates and Purchaser for purposes of the
post-closing adjustments set forth in this SECTION 1.4. If Seller delivers to
Purchaser a Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Objection
Period, then those elements of the Closing Net Working Capital objected to in
the Statement of Objections shall not thereafter be binding on Seller or its
Affiliates until resolved in accordance with this SECTION 1.4.   (c)
RESOLUTION OF OBJECTIONS.   (i) Seller and Purchaser shall discuss the
objections set forth in the Statement of Objections in good faith and shall
attempt to resolve such objections. If Seller and Purchaser reach agreement
with respect to any objection, such agreement shall be reflected in a written
amendment to the Closing Date Balance Sheet by Seller and Purchaser and shall
be conclusive, final and binding on the parties hereto. The Closing Date
Balance Sheet, as amended finally by the parties, and, if necessary, by the
Accounting Expert, is referred to herein as the "FINAL CLOSING DATE BALANCE
SHEET" (and the resultant Closing Net Working Capital as reflected in and
calculated from such Final Closing Date Balance Sheet is referred to herein
as the "FINAL CLOSING NET WORKING CAPITAL") and shall become binding upon
Seller, its Affiliates and Purchaser for purposes of the post-closing
adjustments set forth in this SECTION 1.4.   (ii) If Seller and Purchaser
do not reach such written agreement by the close of business on the
fourteenth (14th) day following delivery to Purchaser of the Statement of
Objections, Purchaser and Seller will jointly select the Chicago office of
one of the three (3) largest United States independent certified public
accountants (other than Ernst and Young LLP and Arthur Andersen LLP) (the
"ACCOUNTING EXPERT"), which, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator,
shall resolve those matters in dispute with respect to the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and the Closing Net Working Capital. If Purchaser and Seller
fail to agree on an Accounting Expert within fifteen (15) days after
the receipt by Purchaser of the Statement of Objections,    E-10 
11  either Purchaser or Seller may request the American Arbitration
Association to appoint an Accounting Expert (or another accounting firm if
all three (3) accounting firms decline to accept or are disqualified from
accepting the dispute), and such appointment shall be conclusive and binding
upon Seller and its Affiliates and Purchaser.   (iii) Within ten (10) days
after the engagement of the Accounting Expert, Seller and Purchaser shall
provide the Accounting Expert with copies of (A) this Agreement, (B) the
schedule setting forth the Target Net Working Capital, (C) the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and the Schedule of Closing Net Working Capital, (D) any
amendments to the Closing Date Balance Sheet, (E) the Subsequent Financial
Statements, (F) the Final Stub Period Financial Statements (if then
available), (G) the Statement of Objections and (H) a written submission from
each of Seller and Purchaser setting forth their respective positions with
respect to each item remaining in dispute that was also described in the
Statement of Objections or, in the case of Purchaser, other matters arising
directly out of such remaining items in the Statement of Objections.   (iv)
The Accounting Expert\'s engagement will be limited to (A) reviewing the
items placed in dispute pursuant to clause (iii)(H) above, (B) reviewing the
written submissions provided by Seller and Purchaser pursuant to clause
(iii)(H) above, (C) determining the appropriate and correct amounts for any
item in dispute in the Closing Net Working Capital in accordance with SECTION
1.4(a) hereof; PROVIDED, that in resolving a disputed item, the Accounting
Expert may not assign a value of any particular item greater than
the greatest value of such item claimed by either party or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either party, in each case as
presented to the Accounting Expert and (D) preparing the Final Closing Date
Balance Sheet and calculating the Final Closing Net Working Capital, which
will include those amounts in the Closing Date Balance Sheet accepted by
Seller pursuant to SECTION 1.4(b), those amounts agreed to by Seller and
Purchaser in any written amendment to the Closing Date Balance Sheet and
those amounts determined by the Accounting Expert pursuant to subclause (C)
of this clause (iv).   (v) The Accounting Expert shall complete its
preparation of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet as soon as practicable
and in any event within forty-five (45) days after its engagement (or such
other time as Purchaser and Seller shall agree in writing), and shall deliver
a copy of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet (and the associated
calculation of the Final Closing Net Working Capital) to Seller and to
Purchaser, together with a report setting forth each disputed adjustment, the
Accounting Expert\'s determination with respect thereto and a statement of
the Accounting Expert\'s reasons for such determination. The Final Closing
Date Balance Sheet prepared by the Accounting Expert and the Final Closing
Net Working Capital calculated by the Accounting Expert shall be conclusive
and binding on Seller and its Affiliates and Purchaser and its
Affiliates.   (vi) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
including, but not limited to, any provision stating that remedies shall be
cumulative and not exclusive, this SECTION 1.4 provides the sole
and exclusive method for resolving any and all disputes of each and every
nature whatever that may arise between or among the parties with respect to
the Closing Net Working Capital and the Closing Date Balance Sheet. All
parties hereto hereby    E-11  12  irrevocably waive, relinquish and
surrender all rights to, and agree that they will not attempt to resolve any
such dispute or disputes in any manner other than as set forth in this
SECTION 1.4(c), including, but not limited to, litigation. All parties hereto
further agree that if one or more of them should initiate any attempt to
resolve any such dispute or disputes in any manner other than the sole and
exclusive manner set forth in THIS SECTION 1.4(c), such initiator or
initiators shall pay and reimburse all fees, costs and expenses incurred by
any other party hereto as a result of, in connection with or related to said
attempt or attempts. The parties hereto intend their respective agreements in
this SECTION 1.4(c) to be binding on all of their respective Affiliates and
Representatives that seek to assert any claim or action in their name or on
their behalf.   (d) NET WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT.   (i) If (A) the
Target Net Working Capital exceeds the Final Closing Net Working Capital and
(B) the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital exceeds the Final Closing Net
Working Capital, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to (x) the
Target Net Working Capital MINUS the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment
Amount (if any), MINUS (y) the Final Closing Net Working Capital.   (ii) If
(A) the Target Net Working Capital exceeds or equals the Final Closing Net
Working Capital and (B) the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is less
than the Final Closing Net Working Capital, Purchaser shall pay to Seller an
amount equal to (x) the Final Closing Net Working Capital MINUS (y) the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital.   (iii) If (A) the Final Closing Net
Working Capital exceeds the Target Net Working Capital by at least $2.5
million and (B) the Closing occurs during a Two-Way Adjustment Period as set
forth on the table in Section D of SCHEDULE 1.3(b) hereof, Purchaser shall
pay to Seller an amount equal to (x) one-half (1/2) of the lesser of (1) (I)
the Final Closing Net Working Capital minus the Target Net Working Capital,
minus (II) $2.5 million, or (2) $2.5 million, plus (y) the Estimated Working
Capital Adjustment Amount (if any).   (iv) If (A) the Final Closing Net
Working Capital exceeds the Target Net Working Capital, but the excess is
less than $2.5 million, and (B) the Closing occurs during a Two-Way
Adjustment Period as set forth on the table in SECTION D of SCHEDULE 1.3(b)
hereof, Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the Estimated
Working Capital Adjustment Amount (if any).   (v) If (A) the Final Closing
Net Working Capital exceeds the Target Net Working Capital and (B) the
Closing occurs during a One-Way Adjustment Period as set forth on the table
in SECTION D of SCHEDULE 1.3(b) hereof, Purchaser shall pay to Seller an
amount equal to the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount (if any).

All payments under this SECTION 1.4 shall be made in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a bank account or bank accounts designated by
Purchaser or Seller, as appropriate, in writing. Any amount payable under
this SECTION 1.4 shall be paid within five (5) Business Days of the time such
amounts are finally determined and become binding on the parties hereto
pursuant to THIS SECTION 1.4, such final determination to be evidenced by a
written acknowledgment of Purchaser and Seller to such effect or, in the
absence thereof, a written determination pursuant to SECTION 1.4(c) of this
Agreement by the Accounting Expert.   (f) FEES OF ACCOUNTING EXPERT. In the
event any dispute is submitted to the Accounting Expert for resolution as
provided in SECTION 1.4(c) of this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser shall each

purposes of this Agreement and the Canadian Purchase Agreement to be the
"CANADIAN PURCHASE PRICE" (as defined in the Canadian Purchase Agreement),
and if such amount is greater or less than the Canadian Purchase Price
initially established in the Canadian Purchase Agreement, the initial
Purchase Price of $330,000,000 hereunder shall be deemed to have been
decreased or increased by a corresponding amount.   SECTION 1.5 CLOSING.

shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use
their reasonable best efforts to contest and resist, except insofar as Parent

as Purchaser decides (and it shall be entitled in its sole discretion to so
decide) to cease contesting or resisting such preliminary injunction, order
or stay or termination of this Agreement and has notified Parent of its
determination pursuant to SECTION 4.4(d) hereof. Under    E-43  44  no
circumstances shall Purchaser or Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates be required to hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or

transactions contemplated by this Agreement set forth in Article VII of this
Agreement as they apply to such party, nor shall Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates be required to hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or
divest or dispose of any of the Assets or any portion of the Business.

make all strategic and tactical decisions as to the manner in which to
contest, resist or respond to all inquiries, investigations, actions
or proceedings (or threatened investigations, actions or proceedings) under
or relating to the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws, including all decisions
with respect to: (i) communicating with Governmental Authorities, (ii)
whether or not to continue contesting and resisting any action or proceeding
after issuance of any preliminary injunction under the Antitrust Laws by any
United States federal or state court, and (iii) on what terms Purchaser and
Parent shall resolve any objection, or any action or proceeding instituted
(or threatened to be instituted) under any Antitrust Law challenging the
Share Purchase or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Seller and Parent shall, and shall direct their counsel and other
Representatives to, cooperate with Purchaser and act in accordance with any
direction given by Purchaser in connection with any action to be taken under
SECTION 4.4(b) or under this SECTION 4.4(c) of which Seller and Parent has
received notice under this SECTION 4.4(c), unless Seller and Parent shall
conclude, after consultation with its legal counsel, that a particular action
or failure to act would likely violate an applicable legal duty or
prohibition.   (d) Purchaser shall promptly advise Seller and Parent
in writing if it determines pursuant to this SECTION 4.4 to cease contesting
and resisting actions relating to the Antitrust Laws. The preceding sentence
shall not be construed to afford Purchaser any right to cease actions under
SECTION 4.4, which rights shall solely be established under SECTION
4.4(a)-(c). All directions, requests, notices and other communications by
Purchaser to Seller and Parent under this SECTION 4.4 shall be in writing and
shall set forth in reasonable specificity the subject direction, request or
notice.   (e) Any factual information, documents, opinions, strategies or
other materials exchanged or communicated by Seller and Parent to
Purchaser, or by Purchaser to Seller and Parent, in the course of the
parties\' negotiations, respective due diligence or joint defense efforts
related to the subject matter hereunder shall be subject to the terms of a
joint defense and confidentiality agreement previously entered into among
counsel to the parties.   (f) As used in this Agreement, the term "ANTITRUST
LAWS" means the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other federal,
state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative or judicial doctrines or other laws that are designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or otherwise denominated as competition
laws of the particular jurisdiction.    E-44  45   SECTION 4.5 NOTICE
OF DEVELOPMENT. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, the
Companies or Seller and/or Parent, as applicable, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other hand, shall give prompt notice to the other of any
event, or the failure of a party hereto or any Affiliate of any party hereto
to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder, which occurrence or failure would be

certain assignments of Intellectual Property, Seller shall cause the
assignment of beneficial title therein to be effected prior to the Closing
and, subsequent to the Closing, will provide all assistance and cooperation
as is necessary to effectuate recordable assignment of such assets. If for a

either of the parties hereto that (i) certain assets and properties of the
Business were not properly included in the Outside Assets and assigned to the
New Group owned or (ii) certain assets and properties of Seller which relate

AHCGC or (ii) any Assumed Seller Liability was not properly assumed by Newco
prior to the Closing or (iii) any Canadian Liability (other any Excluded
Canadian Liability, as such term is defined in the Canadian Purchase
Agreement) which was required to be assumed by Canadian Purchaser pursuant to

Purchaser at the Closing, Purchaser shall, and Purchaser shall cause its
Affiliates to, take all actions necessary to effect the assignment back to
Parent or one of its Affiliates, as designated by Parent, of such Excluded
Seller Assets, or the assumption by Purchaser or one of its Affiliates, as
designated by Purchaser, of such Assumed Seller Liabilities or Canadian
Liabilities, as the case may be.   SECTION 4.17 CANADIAN ASSET ACQUISITION.

executed letter in which Arthur Andersen: (i) acknowledges that it
understands that Purchaser intends to file the Audited Financial Statements,
the Final Stub Period Financial Statements and/or the Interim Financial
Statements (as required by the Securities Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
pursuant to the Securities Act and the Exchange Act ("SEC FILINGS")), and if
provided, the 2001 Audited Financial Statements in statements and reports
required to be filed by Purchaser and its successors from time to time with
the SEC pursuant to SEC Filings, (ii) subject to its usual procedures and
professional standards and after being given reasonable opportunity to review
such SEC Filings and documents incorporated by reference therein,
agrees     E-56  57  that it shall consent to the inclusion of any of
its audit reports on the Audited Financial Statements and, if PROVIDED, the
2001 Audited Financial Statements in any SEC Filing, until such financial
statements and consents are no longer required to be included in such SEC
Filing by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and (iii) acknowledges that
Purchaser will be providing the Subsequent Financial Statements, the Final
Stub Period Financial Statements and if provided prior to the Closing, the
2001 Audited Financial Statements, to potential lenders for the transactions

commercially reasonably efforts to cause Arthur Andersen, including by
providing customary representation letters and other customary documents and
instruments, (I) to consent to the inclusion of any of its audit reports on
the Audited Financial Statements, and if provided, the 2001 Audited Financial
Statements, in any SEC Filing and (II) to issue customary comfort letters
(concerning matters which are the subject of the Audited Financial Statements
or the Final Stub Period Financial Statements, or, if provided, the 2001
Audited Financial Statements) that may be required in connection with any
offering of debt or equity securities by Purchaser or its successors (after
being given reasonable opportunity to review such offering documents).  
(b) If Arthur Andersen fails, for any reason whatsoever, to consent to the
inclusion of any such audit reports on the Audited Financial Statements and,
if provided, the 2001 Audited Financial Statements in any SEC Filing or to
provide such comfort letters, Parent shall, and shall cause Seller to, (i)
provide Purchaser\'s Representatives access to its Books and Records
and personnel commensurate with what it provided Arthur Andersen in
connection with its audit of the Audited Financial Statements and, if
provided, the 2001 Audited Financial Statements and its review of the Final
Stub Period Financial Statements so that Purchaser may expeditiously cause
any or all of such financial statements to be reaudited, again reviewed or to
be so confirmed by "comfort" letters as the case may be, (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause Arthur Andersen to cooperate with
the auditors engaged by Purchaser to conduct such audit or review and (iii)
provide customary representation letters and other customary documents and
instruments. Seller and Parent acknowledge that if Arthur Andersen fails to
consent to the inclusion of any such audit reports in any SEC Filing and
Purchaser or any of its successors is denied in any manner whatsoever the
access provided for in this SECTION 4.19(b), Purchaser and its successors (if
any) will suffer irreparable injury and damage. Therefore, Seller and Parent
agree that if Purchaser or its successors is denied access provided for in
this SECTION 4.19(b) in any manner whatsoever, Purchaser and its successors
(if any) will be entitled to, in addition to all other remedies available to
it, injunctive relief and specific performance to prevent the breach of and
to secure the enforcement of this SECTION 4.19(b).   SECTION 4.20

reasonably efforts (i) to obtain all necessary consents, opinions,
certificates and other documentation necessary to obtain funding under the

Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that any Contract to be transferred
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement may not be
properly transferred without the Consent of a third-party (including any
Governmental Authority), or if the transfer or attempted transfer would
constitute a violation or breach thereof or a violation of any Law, nothing
in this Agreement will constitute a transfer or an attempted transfer thereof
and, except as provided for in SECTION 4.21(d) below, Purchaser and the New
Group shall not be deemed to assume any Liabilities thereunder until properly
transferred.   (c) To the extent that the Consents described in
SECTION 4.21(a) or that are otherwise necessary to assign, transfer, sublease

extensions thereof as requested by Purchaser to the    E-58  59  extent
expressly provided for under such Contract or Permit), or (y) the
period ending upon Parent\'s receipt of written notice (or, if later, the
effective time of such termination set forth in such notice) from Purchaser

efforts (which shall not be deemed to include a guarantee of performance by
Parent or Seller) to (A) provide to Purchaser and its Affiliates the benefits
of any such Asset not assigned, transferred, subleased or sublicensed due to
Parent\'s or its Affiliates\' failure or inability to obtain such Consent,
(B) cooperate with Purchaser and its Affiliates to reach a reasonable and
lawful arrangement designed to provide such benefits to Purchaser and its
Affiliates during such period and (C) enforce at the request of Purchaser, or
allow Purchaser and its Affiliates to enforce (and, solely for such purpose,
Parent hereby constitutes and appoints Purchaser or the subject Affiliate as
its true and lawful attorney-in-fact), any rights of Parent and its
Affiliates under any such Asset against the issuer thereof or the other party
or parties thereto (including the right to elect to terminate such of the
foregoing in accordance with the terms thereof upon the request of
Purchaser); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable professional fees and expenses) incurred by Parent or
its Affiliates at Purchaser\'s request, and incurred by Purchaser or its
Affiliates, in each case, with respect to any of the actions contemplated
under (C) above, shall be borne equally by Purchaser and Seller. The failure
or inability to obtain any Consent subject to this SECTION 4.21 shall not be
a breach of this Agreement so long as Parent and its Affiliates have carried
out their obligations under this SECTION 4.21, PROVIDED, the foregoing shall
not limit the conditions to Closing set forth in ARTICLE VII hereof.   (d)
To the extent that Purchaser or its Affiliates are provided the benefits of

Affiliate shall perform for the benefit of the issuer thereof, or the other
party or parties thereto, the obligations of Parent or its
relevant Affiliate, as the case may be, thereunder or in connection
therewith, but only to the extent (i) that such action by Purchaser would not
result in any default thereunder or in connection therewith and (ii) such
performance pertains to the benefits provided to Purchaser or its Affiliates;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if Purchaser or its Affiliate shall fail to perform
to the extent required herein and such failure continues for ten (10)
Business Days following notice thereof to Purchaser, Parent and its
Affiliates shall (A) thereafter cease to be obligated under this SECTION 4.21
to provide Purchaser or its Affiliates with any benefits in respect of the
Asset which is the subject of such failure to perform unless and until such
situation is remedied or, (B) at the sole option of Parent (provided such
Contract was (x) a Material Contract or (y) (1) a non-Material Contract as to
which Parent had at Closing notified Purchaser was to be subject to this
SECTION 4.21 and (2) within ten (10) Business Days after Closing, Purchaser
had not notified Parent of its desire not to be transferred such Contract),
Purchaser shall promptly pay or reimburse Parent to remedy such failure to
perform during such period of failure of performance for the shorter of the
periods set forth in subpart (x) or (y) of SECTION 4.21(c) above.   SECTION

Salaried Plans, as applicable. The New Hourly and Salaried Plans shall at
Closing provide, with respect to service with the Companies before Closing,
benefits, rights and features that are identical in all respects to those
provided by Parent\'s Hourly and Salaried Plans to the Employees as of the
Closing Date. The Employees shall participate in the New Hourly and Salaried
Plans, as applicable, as of the Closing Date.   (c) The date on which the
plan liabilities of Parent\'s Hourly and Salaried Plans are calculated shall
be called the "TRANSFER DATE" and shall be effected as soon as practicable
following the Closing Date. The plan liabilities of the Parent\'s Hourly Plan
to be transferred to the New Hourly Plan (the "HOURLY PENSION Liabilities")
shall be the actuarial present value of the accrued plan benefits of
Employees who are participants in the Parent\'s Hourly Plan as of the
Transfer Date calculated pursuant to Section 414(l) of the Internal Revenue
Code using the following actuarial assumptions: (i) for determining the
present value of benefit liabilities, an interest rate equal to the rate
prescribed by the PBGC for terminating pension plans for the month in which
the Transfer Date occurs, as set forth in ERISA Section 4044 and
PBGC Regulation    E-64  65  Section 4044.52 and Appendix B to Part
4044; (ii) the mortality table, as set forth in Treasury Regulation Section
4044.53 and Appendix A to Part 4044 (Part 4022 as of March 17, 2000); (iii)
the PBGC\'s expected retirement ages as set forth in PBGC Regulation Section
4044.55 and Appendix D to Part 4044, Table II-A, II-B or II-C, as applicable
based on (A) an unreduced retirement age equal to the earliest age at which
the entire benefit can commence on an unreduced basis, and (B) an earliest
retirement age equal to the earliest age at which the entire benefit can be
commenced; (iv) the loading assumptions set forth in PBGC Regulation Section
4044.52(e) and Appendix C to Part 4044; and (v) for purposes of determining
eligibility for retirement subsidies such calculations shall be based upon
service as of the Transfer Date and age as of the applicable
expected retirement age as determined pursuant to clause (iii) above. As soon
as practicable following the Transfer Date, pursuant to SECTION 5.2(g)
below, Parent shall cause assets of Parent\'s Hourly Plans equal to either
(i) the Hourly Pension Liabilities or (ii) the amount required by Code
Section 414(l) if the funded status of Parent\'s Hourly Plan as of the
Transfer Dates determined using the foregoing actuarial assumption would
prohibit the transfer of assets equal to the Hourly Plan Liabilities (the
"HOURLY PENSION ASSETS") plus interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the
Transfer Date to the date the Hourly Pension Assets are actually conveyed, to
be conveyed in cash to the New Hourly Plan. Until the Hourly Pension Assets
are transferred to the New Hourly Plan, Parent or the Operating Company, as
applicable, will continue to process distributions required to be made to
Employees under Parent\'s Hourly Plan on and after the Closing Date in
accordance with its terms and procedures.   (d) The plan liabilities of the
Parent\'s Salaried Plan to be transferred to the New Salaried Plan (the
"SALARIED PENSION LIABILITIES") shall be the actuarial present value of the
accrued plan benefits of Employees who are participants in the Parent\'s
Salaried Plan as of the Transfer Date calculated pursuant to Section 414(l)
of the Internal Revenue Code using the following actuarial assumptions: (i)
for determining the present value of benefit liabilities, an interest rate
equal to the rate prescribed by the PBGC for terminating pension plans for
the month in which the Transfer Date occurs, as set forth in ERISA Section
4044 and PBGC Regulation Section 4044.52 and Appendix B to Part 4044; (ii)
the mortality table, as set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 4044.53 and
Appendix A to Part 4044 (Part 4022 as of March 17, 2000); (iii) the PBGC\'s
expected retirement ages as set forth in PBGC Regulation Section 4044.55 and
Appendix D to Part 4044, Table II-A, II-B or II-C, as applicable based on (A)
an unreduced retirement age equal to the earliest age at which the entire
benefit can commence on an unreduced basis, and (B) an earliest retirement
age equal to the earliest age at which the entire benefit can be commenced;
(iv) the loading assumptions set forth in PBGC Regulation Section 4044.52(e)
and Appendix C to Part 4044; and (v) for purposes of determining eligibility
for retirement subsidies such calculations shall be based upon service as of
the Transfer Date and age as of the applicable expected retirement age as
determined pursuant to clause (iii) above. As soon as practicable following
the Transfer Date, Parent shall cause assets of Parent\'s Salaried Plan equal
to either (i) the Salaried Pension Liabilities or (ii) the amount required by
Code Section 414(l) if the funded status of Parent\'s Salaried Plan as of
the Transfer Date determined using the foregoing actuarial assumption would
prohibit the transfer of assets equal to the Salaried Plan Liabilities (the
"SALARIED PENSION ASSETS") plus interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the
Transfer Date to the date the Salaried Pension Assets are actually conveyed,
to be conveyed in cash to the New Salaried Plan. Until the Salaried Pension
Assets are transferred to the New Salaried Plan, Parent    E-65  66  or
the Operating Company, as applicable, will continue to process
distributions required to be made to Employees under Parent\'s Salaried Plan
or after the Closing Date, in accordance with its terms and procedures.  
(e) If as of the Transfer Date the aggregate amount of Hourly Pension Assets
to be transferred from Parent\'s Hourly Plan to the New Hourly Plan as
determined under SECTION 5.2(c) hereof do not equal or exceed the amount of
the Hourly Pension Liabilities also to be transferred under SECTION
5.2(c) hereof, then Seller shall pay Purchaser the difference between the
Hourly Pension Liabilities and the Hourly Pension Assets, plus interest at
the rate of 6% per annum from the Transfer Date to the date the Hourly
Pension Assets are actually conveyed in cash to Purchaser. Such payment shall
be made no later than five (5) Business Days after the amount of the Hourly
Pension Assets and the Hourly Pension Liabilities to be transferred are
finally determined under SECTION 5.2(g) hereof.   (f) If as of the Transfer
Date the aggregate amount of Salaried Pension Assets to be transferred from
Parent\'s Salaried Plan to the New Salaried Plan as determined under SECTION
5.2(d) hereof do not equal or exceed the amount of the Salaried Pension
Liabilities also to be transferred under SECTION 5.2(d) hereof, then Seller
shall pay Purchaser the difference between the Salaried Pension Liabilities
and the Salaried Pension Assets, plus interest at the rate of 6% per annum
from the Transfer Date to the date the Salaried Pension Assets are actually
conveyed in cash to Purchaser. Such payment shall be made no later than five
(5) Business Days after the amount of the Salaried Pension Assets and the
Hourly Pension Liabilities to be transferred are finally determined under
SECTION 5.2(g) hereof.   (g) Parent\'s actuary shall deliver a report to
Parent setting forth the determination of the values of each the Hourly
Pension Liabilities and the Salaried Pension Liabilities using the
assumptions set forth in SECTIONS 5.2(c) and (D), and Parent shall provide a
copy to Purchaser. Purchaser shall have fourteen (14) days to notify Parent
in writing of any objections regarding the determination of the Hourly
Pension Liabilities and Salaried Pension Liabilities. If Purchaser timely
notifies Parent of any objections that Parent and Purchaser cannot resolve
within thirty (30) days thereafter, Parent and Purchaser shall appoint an
actuarial firm satisfactory to both parties (the cost of which shall be paid
evenly by both parties) to resolve such objections, which resolution shall be
final and binding on both parties. In the event that Purchaser shall object
to the determination of the Hourly Pension Liabilities and/or Salaried
Pension Liabilities and such objections have not been resolved by the
Transfer Date, then Parent may in its discretion transfer to, and Purchaser
shall accept in, the New Hourly and Salaried Plans assets in the form of cash
from Parent\'s Hourly and Salaried Plans as specified in SECTION 5.2(c) and
5.2(D) based on the determination of the Hourly Pension Liabilities and
the Salaried Pension Liabilities made by Parent\'s actuary. If Purchaser\'s
objections regarding the determination of the Hourly Pension Liabilities
and/or Salaried Pension Liabilities are later resolved in favor of Purchaser
and the amount of the Hourly Pension Liabilities and/or Salaried Pension
Liabilities are increased, then Parent shall cause assets of Parent\'s Hourly
Plan and/or Parent\'s Salaried Plan in the form of cash which reflect such
adjustment in the Hourly Pension Liabilities and/or Salaried Pension
Liabilities as of the Transfer Date, to be transferred in accordance with
SECTIONS 5.2(c) and (d) to the New Hourly Plan and/or New Salaried Plan, plus
interest from the Transfer Date to the date such    E-66 
67  additional assets are actually conveyed in cash at the rate of 6% per
annum on such additional assets.   (h) The benefits to be provided to
salaried and non-union hourly Employees under the New Hourly and Salaried
Plans for a period of 12-months after the Closing shall not be less than
either (i) those provided to such Employees under Parent\'s Hourly and
Salaried Plans, as applicable, immediately prior to the Closing Date or (ii)
those provided under Purchaser\'s defined benefit pension plans from time to
time during such 12-month period to similarly situated employees of
Purchaser; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing herein shall prohibit Purchaser
from amending its defined benefit pension plan or the New Hourly and Salaried
Plans at any time following the Closing.   SECTION 5.3 DEFINED CONTRIBUTION
PLANS. As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Parent or Operating
Company, as applicable, shall spin-off and transfer the account balances of
each Employee who is employed by a Company on the Closing Date and who is a
participant in the Newell Rubbermaid 401(k) Savings Plan (the "PARENT\'S
401(k) PLAN") to a 401(k) Plan established or maintained by Purchaser (the
"NEW 401(k) PLAN") in a trustee to trustee transfer in accordance with
Section 414(l) of the Code. The transfer of the account balance liability and
related assets shall include a trustee-to-trustee transfer of all participant
loan accounts and liabilities under Parent\'s 401(k) Plan. The level of
contributions to be provided to salaried and non-union Employees under the
New 401(k) Plan shall not be less than those provided to similarly
situated employees of Purchaser. The New 401(k) Plan will provide that
Employees\' periods of service credited under Parent\'s 401(k) Plan will be
credited for purposes of determining participation, vesting and eligibility
for any other benefit right or feature of the New 401(k) Plan which is
available based upon service.   SECTION 5.4 RETIREE HEALTH. On and after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall establish for Employees a retiree health and
life insurance plan and Purchaser shall assume all Liabilities with respect
to the Employees under the Newell Medical Plan for Retirees ("PARENT\'S
RETIREE PLAN"). Purchaser shall not assume any Liabilities with respect to
any retiree health and life insurance benefits of any Employees who are not
employed by a Company on the Closing Date and any such benefits shall
continue to be provided under Parent\'s Retiree Plan.   SECTION 5.5 WELFARE
PLANS.   (a) Parent shall retain all liability for claims incurred under
the Company Benefit Plans that are welfare benefit plans within the meaning
of Section 3(1) of ERISA and all severance plans or arrangements, whether or
not such plans or arrangements are "welfare benefit plans" within the meaning
of Section 3(1) of ERISA (the "PARENT\'S WELFARE PLANS") on and prior to the
Closing Date. For this purpose claims under any medical, dental, vision,
or prescription drug plan, generally will be deemed to be incurred on the
date that the service giving rise to such claim is performed and not when
such claim is made; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that with respect to claims relating
to hospitalization the claim will be deemed to be incurred on the first day
of such hospitalization and not on the date that such services are performed.
Claims for disability under any long or short term disability plan shall be
incurred on the date the Employee or former Employee is first absent from
work because of the condition giving rise to such disability and not   
E-67  68 when the Employee or former Employee is determined to be eligible
for benefits under the applicable Parent\'s Welfare Plan. Seller shall
provide under Parent\'s Welfare Plans any continuation coverage required
under Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or applicable
state law ("COBRA") to each "qualified beneficiary" as that term is defined
in COBRA whose first "qualifying event" (as defined in COBRA) occurs on or
prior to the Closing Date.   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, Parent or the Operating Company, as
applicable, shall spin-off and transfer all of the accounts of its Section
125 flexible spending plan attributable to Employees who are employed by a
Company on the Closing Date and their dependents and beneficiaries to a new
Section 125 flexible spending plan established by the Purchaser. Neither the
Operating Company nor Seller shall have any liability with respect to the
Purchaser\'s Section 125 flexible spending plan after the Closing Date,
including liability for any Claims incurred prior to the Closing Date.  
SECTION 5.6 COMPENSATION AND BONUS PLANS. For twelve (12) months following
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not reduce the base salary or base hourly
wage rate of any Employee below the rate in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Parent shall pay
all bonuses and incentive compensation, if any, earned by the Employees under
the Company Benefit Plans which are bonus and or incentive
compensation plans. For purposes of determining the amount of any such bonus
or whether any performance targets or goals entitling Employees to any such
bonuses Parent shall treat the Closing Date as the last day of the applicable
period for determining bonuses and shall, if applicable, annualize any
financial or other performance results. If an Employee participates in a
bonus plan of Parent, Seller, the Operating Company or a Company as of the
Closing Date, then Purchaser shall make a bonus plan at the same potential
bonus levels available to such Employee for the remainder of the calendar
year in which the Closing Date occurs; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Purchaser in
its sole discretion may establish the criteria for receiving any such
bonuses.   SECTION 5.7 PURCHASER\'S PLANS. Effective as of the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide welfare benefits to Employees under
welfare benefit plans maintained by Purchaser (the "PURCHASER\'S WELFARE
PLANS"). Purchaser\'s Welfare Plans shall provide Employees with either (a)
welfare benefits substantially similar to those provided under Parent\'s
Welfare Plans immediately prior to the Closing or (b) welfare benefits that
are substantially similar to those provided to Purchaser\'s similarly
situated employees. Purchaser will credit the Employees for their service
with Parent, its Affiliates, the Companies (and any predecessors) for
purposes of eligibility, benefit accruals, waiting periods or other
qualification or eligibility for any benefit or privilege, under Purchaser\'s
Welfare Plans in which Employees are allowed to participate after the
Closing, and any applicable vacation or severance policies or programs, but
not to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. The
Employees will be allowed by Purchaser to participate in Purchaser\'s Plans
without being subject to any waiting periods or any restrictions or
limitations for pre-existing conditions, except to the extent any such
Employee has not satisfied any corresponding applicable waiting period, or
limitation under the Company Benefit Plans. Purchaser\'s Welfare Plans
shall credit each Employee (including any spouses and dependents) with the
amount, if any, paid during the calendar year in which the Closing Date
occurs under the Company Benefit Plans towards deductibles, co-pays and out-
of-pocket maximums.    E-68  69   SECTION 5.8 SEVERANCE. If during the
nine (9) month period following the Closing Date, any Employee would be
eligible for severance under Purchaser\'s severance plan set forth on SECTION
5.8-1 hereof of the Disclosure Schedule (or would be eligible for such
severance but for the fact that such Employee is a non-union hourly employee)
Purchaser shall provide such Employee severance benefits equal to the
severance benefits set forth on SECTION 5.8-2 of the Disclosure Schedule.  
SECTION 5.9 COOPERATION. Seller and Parent shall cooperate with Purchaser in
providing such employee records, data and information necessary in order for
Purchaser to perform its obligations and responsibilities under the
Purchaser\'s Plans as required by this ARTICLE V.   SECTION 5.10 NO THIRD
PARTY BENEFICIARIES. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all
provisions contained in this Agreement with respect to employee benefits or
employee compensation are included for the sole benefit of the respective
parties hereto and shall not create any right in any other Person, including
any Employees, former Employees, any participant in any Company Benefit Plan
or any beneficiary thereof. Nothing contained herein shall interfere with
Purchaser\'s right to amend or terminate the Companies Hourly and Salaried
Plans or any Purchaser Plan after the Closing.   ARTICLE VI  TAX
MATTERS   SECTION 6.1 SECTION 338(h)(10) ELECTION.   (a) With respect to
the Share Purchase and the deemed sale for Tax purposes of the shares of
AHCGC, subject to SECTIONS 6.1(b)-(d), Parent (and, to the extent necessary,
its Affiliates) will join with Purchaser (and, to the extent necessary, its
Affiliates) to make irrevocable elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code and, if permissible, similar elections under any applicable state or
local Tax laws (collectively, the "ELECTIONS"). Purchaser and Parent (and
their Affiliates) shall report the transaction consistently with the
Elections and agree not to take any action that could cause such Elections to
be invalid, and shall take no position contrary thereto unless required to
do so pursuant to a determination (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code
or any similar state or local Tax provision).   (b) Within six months after
the Closing Date, Purchaser (and, to the extent necessary, its Affiliates)
shall prepare any and all forms necessary to effectuate the Elections
(including Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 and any similar forms under
applicable state and local tax laws (collectively, the "SECTION 338 FORMS"))
and shall provide copies thereof to Parent. Purchaser and Parent (and, to the
extent necessary, their Affiliates) shall each cause the Section 338 Forms to
be duly executed by an authorized person and Purchaser shall duly and timely
file the Section 338 Forms in accordance with applicable Tax laws and the
terms of this Agreement. Parent (and, to the extent necessary, its
Affiliates) (i) shall include a copy of Form 8023 with its income and
franchise Tax Returns for any tax period that includes the Closing Date, (ii)
shall, as specifically and reasonably instructed by the Purchaser, take all
actions necessary and appropriate (including filing such additional forms,
Tax Returns, elections,    E-69  70  schedules and other documents as
may be required by applicable Law, and as timely prepared by Purchaser and
delivered to Parent in a timely fashion) to effect and preserve the Elections
in accordance with the provisions of Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 (and
comparable provisions of each applicable state and local Tax law) or any
successor provisions (collectively, the "SECTION 338 ACTS"), and (iii) if
notified by any Taxing Authority that any Section 338 Acts are necessary for
an Election to be valid or if otherwise aware of any Section 338 Acts that
are necessary for an Election to be valid, shall in good faith attempt to
complete the Section 338 Acts.   (c) In no event later than five (5) months
after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare an initial allocation of the
aggregate deemed sales price of the assets of Newco and AHCGC resulting from
the Elections (as required pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and the
Regulations promulgated thereunder) among such assets in accordance with the
parameters set forth in SECTION 6.1(d) and among the assets in each Class (as
provided in Regulation Section 1.338-6(b) or any successor provision) in
accordance with an appraisal (the "APPRAISAL") prepared by a qualified M.A.I.
or other Person with professional competence in conducting appraisals of this
nature (the "SECTION 338 ALLOCATION"), and Purchaser shall submit to Parent
copies of the Section 338 Allocation and the Appraisal. The cost of the
Appraisal shall be borne by Purchaser. Purchaser and Parent (and their
Affiliates) shall file all Tax Returns consistently with the Section 338
Allocation, and shall not voluntarily take any action inconsistent therewith
upon examination of any Tax Returns, in any refund claim, in any litigation,
or otherwise with respect to such Tax Returns unless required to pursuant to
a determination (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar
state or local Tax provision).   (d) Purchaser and Parent agree that (i)
thirty-five percent (35%) of the aggregate deemed sales price (as described
in SECTION 6.1(c)) shall be allocated to the Newco assets (other than the
stock of AHCGC) and sixty-five percent (65%) shall be allocated to the AHCGC
assets and (ii) no less than forty-five percent (45%) or more than sixty-five
percent (65%) of the aggregate deemed sales price allocated to the assets of
each of Newco and AHCGC will be allocated to accounts receivable, Inventory,
property, plant and equipment, prepaid and other non-intangible assets.  
SECTION 6.2 PREPARATION OF TAX RETURNS AND FILINGS.   (a) Subject to SECTION
6.5, for any Taxable Period of the Companies that ends on or before the
Closing Date, Parent shall timely prepare, consistent with past practices and
custom (unless a contrary position is required by Law) and file with the
appropriate Taxing Authority all required consolidated, combined or unitary
Tax Returns that include any of the Companies and shall pay all Taxes shown
due on such Tax Returns.   (b) Subject to SECTION 6.5, for any Taxable
Period of the Companies that ends on or before the Closing Date, Parent shall
timely prepare, consistent with past practices and custom (unless a contrary
position is required by Law) and file with the appropriate Taxing Authority
all other Tax Returns of the Companies and shall pay all Taxes shown due on
such Tax Returns. Parent shall provide Purchaser the opportunity to review
and comment upon such Tax Returns, and if the filing of such Tax Returns may
cause a material increase in the Tax Liability of    E-70  71  any of
Newco or AHCGC for a Post-Closing Tax Period, Parent shall not file any such
Tax Returns without Purchaser\'s consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld and shall be deemed to be provided if such Tax
Return is prepared consistently with past practices and custom of the
Companies or the requirements of applicable Law).   (c) Purchaser shall
provide Parent the opportunity to review and comment upon, and Purchaser
shall timely prepare and file with the appropriate Taxing Authority, all
Newco and AHCGC Tax Returns relating to a Straddle Period required to be
filed and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that Purchaser will prepare such Tax Returns consistent with past
practices and custom of the Companies (unless a contrary position is required
by Law) to the extent such Tax Returns relate to the Taxes of Newco or AHCGC
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period and Purchaser shall not file any such Tax Return
without Parent\'s consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
Seller or Parent shall pay Purchaser (in accordance with the procedures set
forth in SECTION 8.4) for any amount owed by Seller or Parent pursuant to
SECTION 8.4 with respect to any such Tax Returns.   (d) Purchaser and Parent
agree to cause Newco or AHCGC to file all Tax Returns for the period
including the Closing Date on the basis that the relevant Taxable Period
ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date (which shall be deemed
the time of Closing as provided in SECTION 1.5 and which shall include the
tax consequences of the Share Purchase and the Elections) if the relevant Tax
Law allows such a filing and all Newco or AHCGC Tax Returns that are filed
for a Tax Period that begins the day immediately after the Closing Date
(including any group Tax Returns that include Newco or AHCGC beginning on the
day immediately after the Closing Date) shall include all activities of Newco
or AHCGC occurring after the deemed time of Closing provided in SECTION 1.5
other than the tax consequences of the Share Purchase, the Elections and the
results of any inter-company transactions with Parent or its Affiliates.  
SECTION 6.3 FILING OF AMENDED TAX RETURNS. Parent shall be responsible for
filing any Tax Returns that include Newco or AHCGC for taxable years ending
on or prior to the Closing Date that are required as a result of examination
adjustments made by any Taxing Authority for such taxable years as finally
determined and shall pay any Taxes that are due thereon. Parent shall not be
entitled to file (nor shall Purchaser or its Affiliates be under
any obligation to file) any other amended Tax Return for any of the Companies
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period unless the requirements in the last sentence of
SECTION 6.2(b) are satisfied.   SECTION 6.4 TAX REFUNDS. The amount of any
refunds or offsets of Taxes of the Companies for any Taxable Period ending on
or before the Closing Date shall be for the account of Seller, except to the
extent that such refund or offset arises as a result of a Newco or AHCGC
carryback of a loss or other tax benefit arising from a period beginning
after the Closing Date (except as otherwise provided in SECTION 6.5). The
amount of any refunds or offsets of Taxes of Newco or AHCGC for any Taxable
Period beginning after the Closing Date shall be for the account of
Purchaser. The amount of benefit of any refunds or offsets of Taxes of Newco
or AHCGC for any Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned in a manner
consistent with SECTION 8.4(c). Provided that the non-requesting party,
acting in good faith, determines that there is a reasonable basis for filing
a claim for refund with the relevant Taxing Authority and if the    E-71 
72  filing of such a claim is not inconsistent with any other provision of
this Agreement, each party shall, if the other party so requests and at such
other party\'s expense, cause Newco or AHCGC to file for and obtain any
refunds or offsets to Taxes to which the requesting party is expressly
entitled under this ARTICLE VI. Each party shall forward, and shall cause its
Affiliates to forward the amount of such refund or offset to Tax, to the
party entitled pursuant to this ARTICLE VI to receive such amount, within ten
(10) days after such refund is received or after such offset is allowed or
applied against other Tax Liability, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the control of the prosecution of a claim for refund of Taxes paid
pursuant to a deficiency assessed subsequent to the Closing Date as a result
of an audit shall be governed by the provisions of SECTION 8.4(e).  
SECTION 6.5 CARRYBACKS. Purchaser shall not, and shall cause Newco and AHCGC
not to, carryback any net operating loss or other Tax attribute to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period if Newco or AHCGC (as the case may be) were included as
part of a combined, consolidated, or unitary Tax Return in such Tax Period
to which such carryback relates; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any such carryback
will be permitted if such carryback is required by the relevant Tax Law prior
to a carryforward (and a waiver of the carryback is not permitted), the
carryback involves a material net operating loss or other Tax attribute and
Parent consents to such carryback (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld). If Parent or an Affiliate realizes a reduction in Tax for such a
period as a result of such carryback (either in the form of a refund or an
offset), Parent shall pay to Purchaser the amount of such reduction within
ten (10) days after the receipt of the refund or the offset; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that Parent shall be entitled to retain any such reduction in Tax to
the extent that Purchaser or its Affiliates obtain as a result of such
carryback a greater Tax credit carryforward that may be utilized in a Post-
Closing Tax Period. Parent shall, at the request of Purchaser, cooperate in
connection with the filing of any necessary Tax Returns and other documents
to effect a carryback at Purchaser\'s expense, and Parent shall provide a
basis for the computation of the amount paid to Purchaser pursuant to this
SECTION 6.5 in reasonable detail.   SECTION 6.6 COOPERATION IN TAX MATTERS.
Parent, the Companies and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives to reasonably
cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns, including maintaining and
making available to each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes
and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all Taxable Periods
relating to Taxes. Parent and Purchaser agree (a) to retain all Books and
Records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to any Company or Canadian
Seller relating to any Tax Period beginning before the Closing Date until
ninety (90) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with
any Taxing Authority, (b) to allow the other party and its Representatives,
at times and dates mutually acceptable to the parties, to inspect, review and
make copies of such records as such party may deem necessary or appropriate
from time to time, such activities to be conducted during normal business
hours and at such party\'s expense, and (c) to give the other party
reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such Books and Records and, if the other party so requests, Parent and
Purchaser, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession
of such Books and Records.   E-72  73   SECTION 6.7 TRANSFER TAXES. All
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar
Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer or real estate gains
Taxes) and related recording and other fees (collectively, "TRANSFER TAXES")
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be borne by Parent except that any such Transfer
Taxes resulting from the Share Purchase (including any Transfer Taxes
resulting from the Elections but excluding all other Taxes resulting from the
Elections, such as income and franchise Taxes) shall be borne equally by
Parent and Purchaser, and Parent and Purchaser shall cooperate in preparing
and filing all Tax Returns and other documentation on a timely basis as may
be required to comply with the provisions of such Tax laws.   SECTION 6.8
TREATMENT OF INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS. Parent, Seller and Purchaser agree to
treat any amounts payable pursuant to ARTICLE VIII as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for federal income tax purposes, unless a final determination
causes any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price for federal income tax purposes.   ARTICLE VII  CONDITIONS TO
CLOSING   SECTION 7.1 CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF SELLER. The obligation
of Seller and Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by Seller
and Parent), at or prior to the Closing, of each of the following
conditions:   (a) REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The representations
and warranties of Purchaser contained in this Agreement and of Purchaser
and Canadian Purchaser contained in the Canadian Purchase Agreement that
are qualified as to materiality shall be true and correct as of the date
hereof and as of the Closing Date, as if made as of the Closing Date (except
for representations and warranties which by their terms speak as of a
specific date or time, which need only be true and correct as of such date),
and the representations and warranties of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement and of Purchaser and Canadian Purchaser contained in the Canadian
Purchase Agreement that are not so qualified shall be true and correct in all
material respects as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, as if
made as of the Closing Date (other than such representations and warranties
as are made as of another date, which shall be true and correct as of such

Seller, Parent or any of their directors, officers, employees or agents, was
a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Companies or was serving at
the request of any such entity as a partner, trustee, director, officer,
employee, or agent of the Companies (whether such claim is for judgments,
damages, penalties, fines, costs, amounts paid in settlement, losses,
expenses, or otherwise and whether such claim is pursuant to any statute,
charter document, bylaw, agreement, or otherwise), including with respect to
any action, suit, proceeding, complaint, claim, or demand brought

proceeding, complaint, claim, or demand is pursuant to this Agreement,
applicable law, or otherwise);    E-78  79   (xiii) the 1995

Seller Liabilities and Canadian Liabilities, unless such Liability is subject
to indemnification under SECTION 8.2(a) hereof or under SECTION 8(b) of the
Canadian Purchase Agreement.   (c) INDEMNIFICATION PROCESS. The Person
making a claim for indemnification under this ARTICLE VIII shall be, for the
purposes of this Agreement, referred to as the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY" (provided
that for the purpose of clause (iii) below such term shall refer to the party
hereto to whom such Person is related for purposes of obtaining the benefits
of this Article VIII) and the party or parties against whom such claims are
asserted under this Article VIII shall be, for the purposes of this
Agreement, referred to as the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY." All claims by any
Indemnified Party under this ARTICLE VIII, other than Tax Claims which are
subject to the provisions of SECTION 8.4 hereof, shall be asserted and
resolved as follows:   (i) NOTICE OF CLAIMS. In the event that (i) any claim
or Action is asserted or instituted against any Indemnified Party by any
Person other than the parties to this Agreement or their Affiliates which
could give rise to Damages for which an Indemnifying Party could be liable to
an Indemnified Party for Damages under this Agreement (such claim, demand
or Proceeding, a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM") or (ii) any Indemnified Party under
this Agreement shall have a claim to be indemnified for Damages by any
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement which does not involve a Third Party
Claim (such claim, a "DIRECT CLAIM" and, together with Third Party Claims,
"CLAIMS"), the Indemnified Party shall with reasonable promptness send to the
Indemnifying Party a written notice specifying the nature of such Claim, the
amount of Damages sought in such Claim, if known, and the provisions of this
Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or
arises (a "CLAIM NOTICE"), PROVIDED that a delay or defect in notifying the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under this Agreement except to the extent that (and only to the
extent that) the Indemnifying Party demonstrates such failure shall have
caused the Damages for which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to be
greater than such Damages would have been had the Indemnified Party given the
Indemnifying Party timely notice.   (ii) THIRD PARTY CLAIMS. In the event of
a Third Party Claim (except for any Third Party Claims that are indemnifiable
under either SECTION 8.2(a)(vi) or SECTION 8.2(a)(viii), the process for
which is set forth in SECTION 8.2(d)(ii)), the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim and to
appoint counsel of the Indemnifying Party\'s choice at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party to represent    E-80  81  the Indemnified Party and
any others the Indemnifying Party may reasonably designate in connection with
such Third Party Claim (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall not
thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel
retained by any Indemnified Party except as set forth below); PROVIDED that
such counsel is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding an
Indemnifying Party\'s election to appoint one separate counsel (plus one
local counsel, if necessary) to represent an Indemnified Party in connection
with a Third Party Claim, an Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
one separate counsel (plus one local counsel, if necessary), and
the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of
such one separate counsel (plus one local counsel, if necessary) if (A) there
exists a conflict of interest (including the availability of one or more
legal defenses to the Indemnified Party which are not available to the
Indemnifying Party) that would make it inappropriate in the reasonable
judgment of the Indemnified Party (upon and in conformity with advice of
counsel) for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party, PROVIDED that the Indemnified Party and such counsel
shall contest such Third Party Claim in good faith or (B) if the Claim seeks
injunctive relief which, if granted could materially and adversely affect the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate
with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in such defense and make
available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses, records, materials, and
information in the Indemnified Party\'s possession or under the Indemnified
Party\'s control relating thereto as may be reasonably requested by the
Indemnifying Party, and in contesting any claim, demand or Proceeding which
the Indemnifying Party defends, or, if appropriate and related to the claim,
demand or Proceeding in question, in making any counterclaim against the
person asserting the Third Party Claim, or any cross-complaint against any
Person. In the event the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice
thereof in accordance with the terms hereof, (A) the Indemnified
Party against which such Third Party Claim has been asserted shall have the
right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third Party
Claim on behalf of, at the expense of and for the account and risk of the
Indemnifying Party, and (B) the Indemnifying Party agrees to cooperate with
the Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnified
Party, all witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnifying
Party\'s possession or under the Indemnifying Party\'s control relating
thereto as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party.   (iii)
SETTLEMENT OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS. In connection with the settlement or
compromise of any Third Party Claim (except for any Third Party Claims that
are indemnifiable under either SECTION 8.2(a)(vi) or SECTION 8.2(a)(viii),
the process for which is set forth in SECTION 8.2(d)(ii)), the Indemnifying
Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (A) settle or
compromise any Third Party Claims or consent to the entry of any
judgment which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery
by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a written release
from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim of all Indemnified
Parties affected by such Third Party Claim or (B) settle or compromise any
Third Party Claim if the settlement or compromise imposes equitable remedies
or material obligations on the Indemnified Party other than financial
obligations for which such Indemnified Party will be indemnified hereunder or
(C) settle or compromise any Third Party Claim if the Indemnified Party   
E-81  82  will be required to make any payment with respect to such
compromise or settlement due to the application of the limitations of SECTION
8.3. No Third Party Claim which is being defended in good faith by the
Indemnifying Party or which is being defended by the Indemnified Party in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be settled or compromised
by the Indemnified Party without the written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed);
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, if a Third Party Claim is being defended by an Indemnified
Party pursuant to the last sentence of clause (ii) above (unless the
Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party mutually agree that the Indemnified
Party shall defend such Third Party Claim), the limitations on the
Indemnified Party\'s right to settle or compromise set forth in this clause
(iii) shall not apply to such Indemnified Party, unless the
Indemnifying Party has been advancing (in a timely manner) payment of such
Indemnified Party\'s costs and expenses associated with such defense upon
demand therefor by the Indemnified Party (subject to the undertaking of the
Indemnified Party to reimburse such advances in the event such costs of
defense are not ultimately to be indemnifiable under this ARTICLE VIII).  
(iv) REDUCTION OF DAMAGES. To the extent any Damages of an Indemnified Party
are reduced by receipt of payment under insurance policies, which payments
are not subject to retroactive adjustment or other reimbursement to the
insurer in respect of such payment, such payments (net of the expenses of the
recovery thereof) (such net payment, a "REIMBURSEMENT") shall be
credited against any such Damages; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, the pendency of such
payments shall not delay or reduce the obligation of the Indemnifying Party
to make payment to the Indemnified Party in respect of such Damages. The
Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonably efforts (but in no event
shall the Indemnified Party be required to sue the insurer or its agent,
unless the Indemnifying Party agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses
in connection therewith, including reasonable attorneys\' fees) to pursue
payment under or from any insurer in respect of such Damages. If any
Reimbursement is obtained subsequent to payment by an Indemnifying Party in
respect of any Damages, such Reimbursement shall be promptly paid over to the
Indemnifying Party. In the case any event shall have occurred which would
otherwise entitle either party to assert a claim for indemnification
hereunder, no Damages shall be deemed to have been sustained by such party to
the extent of any actual Tax savings realized by such party with respect
thereto (the "TAX BENEFIT"), but such Damages shall be increased by such an
amount necessary in order for the Indemnified Party to receive a net payment,
after paying any Taxes resulting from its receipt of any indemnification
payment for such Damages, equal to the amount of Damages otherwise determined
in accordance with this SECTION 8.2(c)(iv). The Tax losses, deductions,
credits or other items of the Indemnified Party resulting from Damages shall
be deemed to be realized proportionately with any other Tax losses,
deductions, credits or other items available to the Indemnified Party. To the
extent there is a determination (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or
any comparable provision of state, local or foreign law) disallowing the Tax
Benefit, the Indemnifying Party shall refund to the Indemnified Party
the amount of any related reduction of Damages previously allowed pursuant to
this SECTION 8.2(c)(iv).   (v) ACCESS. From and after the delivery of a
Claim Notice under this Agreement, at the reasonable request of the
Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified Party shall grant the Indemnifying Party
and its Representatives all reasonable access to the books, records   
E-82  83  and properties of such Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably
related to the matters to which the Claim Notice relates. All such access
shall be granted during normal business hours and shall be granted under
conditions which will not unreasonably interfere with the business and
operations of such Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will not, and
shall require that its Representatives do not, use (except in connection with
such Claim Notice) or disclose to any third Person other than the
Indemnifying Party\'s Representatives (except as may be required by
applicable Law) any information obtained pursuant to THIS SECTION 8.2(c)(v)
which is designated as confidential by an Indemnified Party.   (d) CERTAIN
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. In connection with any claim for indemnification under
either SECTION 8.2(a)(vi) or SECTION 8.2(a)(viii) (certain releases,
discharges or migration of Hazardous Substances), the following shall apply,
notwithstanding any contrary term of SECTIONS 8.2(c)(ii) or (iii):   (i)
REMEDIATION. Purchaser shall control (A) the decommissioning, removal and
disposal of the assets subject to SECTION 8.2(a)(vi) and the remediation of
any Hazardous Substances released therefrom indemnifiable under SECTION
8.2(a)(vi), and (B) the remediation of any release, discharge or migration of
Hazardous Substances indemnifiable under SECTION 8.2(a)(viii), including the
selection and direction of any contractor, consultants or other Persons
necessary for the performance thereof and the communication with any
Governmental Authority or other Person incident thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, however, Parent and Seller shall have the right to approve the
lead contractor or consultant for any such remediation project, provided such
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Purchaser shall
provide Parent and Seller with copies of any final proposed work plans, bids
or cost projections and allow Parent and Seller a reasonable amount of
time to review and comment on such documents prior to the commencement of the
work proposed therein. Purchaser shall provide Parent and Seller with copies
of any invoices or other documentation of Damages incurred in connection with
any such work and Parent and Seller shall deliver to Purchaser payment of
amounts due in respect of such Damages under SECTIONS 8.2(a)(vi) or (viii),
subject to the applicable limitations in SECTION 8.3, within forty-five (45)
days of its receipt of any such invoices or other documentation (subject to
the undertaking of the Indemnified Party to reimburse such advances in the
event such costs are not ultimately to be indemnifiable under this ARTICLE
VIII). In the event that a new remediation project indemnifiable under
SECTION 8.2(a)(viii) is to commence after the aggregate amount of Damages
incurred by Purchaser and indemnifiable under such clause (but for the
limitations of SECTION 8.3(d)) have already exceeded $5,000,000, then Parent
and Seller shall have the right to approve the performance of such new
remediation project, including the selection of any contractor or consultant,
the preparation and submission of any proposed work plan and the
communication with any Governmental Authority or other Person incident
thereto, and such approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.   (ii) THIRD PARTY CLAIMS. In the event of a Third Party Claim
under either SECTION 8.2(a)(vi) or SECTION 8.2(a)(viii), Purchaser
shall assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim, and the
assertion of any counterclaims or cross-claims relating thereto, including

limitations in SECTION 8.3, within forty-five (45) days of its receipt of any

Indemnified Party to promptly reimburse such advances in the event such costs
are not ultimately to be indemnifiable under this ARTICLE VIII).   (e)
DEFINITION OF DAMAGES. "DAMAGES" shall mean any and all costs, losses,
(including diminution in value) Taxes, liabilities, obligations, damages,
lawsuits, deficiencies, claims, demands, and expenses (whether or not arising
out of Third Party Claims), including interest, penalties, costs
of mitigation, losses in connection with any Environmental Laws (including
any clean-up or remedial action), damages to the environment and,
reasonable attorneys\' fees. The term "DAMAGES" shall not include lost
profits and other losses (other than direct damages) resulting from any
shutdown or curtailment of operations of the Companies (other than lost
profits and other losses payable between or among the parties hereto which
arise out of a Third Party Claim for such Damages). The term "DAMAGES" as
used in this ARTICLE VIII is not limited to matters asserted by third parties
against Seller, Parent or Purchaser, but includes Damages incurred or
sustained by Seller Indemnified Parties or Purchaser Indemnified Parties in
the absence of Third Party Claims. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, Damages shall expressly exclude punitive damages,
exemplary damages, multiple damages and other penalty damages, unless arising
out of a Third Party Claim. Payments by Purchaser Indemnified Parties of
amounts for which Purchaser Indemnified Parties indemnified hereunder, and
payments by Seller Indemnified Parties of amounts for which Seller
Indemnified Parties are indemnified, shall not be a condition precedent to
recovery.   (f) The respective indemnification obligations of the
parties with respect to Tax matters (including any breach of the
representations and warranties contained in SECTION 2.19) shall be governed
by SECTION 8.4 and this SECTION 8.2 shall not be applicable to any such
matters.   SECTION 8.3 LIMITS ON INDEMNIFICATION.   (a) No amount shall be
payable by any Indemnifying Party pursuant to SECTION 8.2(a)(i) and (ii) or
SECTION 8.2(b)(i) and (ii) unless the aggregate amount of Damages
indemnifiable under SECTION 8.2(a)(i) and (ii) or SECTION 8.2(b)(i) and (ii),
respectively, exceeds $4,000,000 (at which point the Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to all indemnification amounts in excess of such threshold
amount); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the above limitation shall not apply   
E-84  85  to any indemnification obligations of Seller and Parent to
Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising from Seller\'s and Parent\'s
representations and warranties set forth in SECTION 2.19 (Taxes) or SECTION
2.22(a)(iii) or (b)(iii) (Title to Assets) or SECTION 2.15(a)(i) (Title to
Owned Property) or indemnification obligations of any party under any other
provision of ARTICLE VIII (nor shall any Damages paid in respect of such
other indemnification obligations be applied toward such $4,000,000
threshold).   (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the maximum amount of indemnifiable Damages which may be
recovered by any Purchaser Indemnified Parties from Seller and Parent and by
any Seller Indemnified Parties from Purchaser arising out of, resulting from
or incident to the matters enumerated in SECTION 8.2(a)(i) or (a)(ii) or
SECTION 8.2(b)(i) or (b)(ii) shall be an amount equal to thirty percent (30%)
of the Purchase Price; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this limitation shall not
apply to any indemnification obligations of Seller and Parent to any
Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising from representations and warranties set
forth in SECTION 2.14 (Employee Benefits), SECTION 2.17 (Environmental
Matters) or SECTION 2.19 (Taxes).   (c) The indemnification obligations
pursuant to SECTION 8.2(a)(vi) shall be limited to fifty percent (50%) of the
Damages subject to indemnification thereunder, PROVIDED this limitation shall
not apply to Damages which are also subject to indemnification under SECTION
8.2(a)(i), (ii) or (vii) hereof.   (d) The indemnification obligations
pursuant to SECTION 8.2(a)(viii) shall survive for a period of five (5) years
after the Closing. With respect to Damages subject to indemnification under
SECTION 8.2(a)(viii), (a) Parent and Seller shall not be obligated to
indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party for the first $3,000,000 of Damages
for which Parent and Seller would otherwise be required to indemnify
Purchaser Indemnified Parties thereunder, and (B) if such Damages exceed
$3,000,000 in the aggregate, Parent and Seller shall indemnify Purchaser
Indemnified Parties for (1) fifty percent (50%) of the Damages that exceed
$3,000,000 and are less than $5,000,000 and (2) all Damages in excess of
$5,000,000.   (e) With respect to the indemnification obligations
pursuant to SECTION 8.2(a)(vii), indemnifiable Damages thereunder shall be
limited only to fines or monetary penalties imposed or demanded by any
Governmental Authority, provided this limitation shall not affect any right
of indemnification under any other clause of SECTION 8.2(a). In the event
that any Governmental Authority agrees to a reduction of the amount of any
fine or penalty in consideration for the performance of any supplemental
environmental project, the indemnifiable Damages shall be the full amount of
the fine or penalty prior to any reduction due to the supplement
environmental project, but shall not include any of the costs to perform such
supplemental environmental project.   (f) No Damages shall be indemnifiable
under SECTION 8.2(a)(x) if such Damages relate to loss by the New Group of
products or services (but not breach of Contract claims) under a Pre-Closing
Material Contract as to which Purchaser or the New Group could obtain (after
using commercially reasonable efforts) substantially equivalent products or
services    E-85  86  on substantially equivalent terms and conditions
(as to the Business) from a no less qualified third-party vendor.   (g) If
Purchaser has provided the Limitation of Indemnification Notice, Parent\'s
and Seller\'s indemnification obligations in respect of Damages pursuant to
SECTION 8.2(a)(ii) shall be limited to $33,200,000 in the aggregate with
respect to Damages arising out of the events, circumstances or conditions set
forth in any Parent Liabilities Notice provided to Purchaser in accordance
with SECTION 4.29 hereof.   (h) To the extent an Indemnifying Party
discharges any claim for indemnification hereunder, it shall be subrogated to
all related rights of the Indemnified Party against third parties (other than
any Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party).   (i) None of
the limitations set forth in SECTION 8.3(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g)
of this Agreement or the limitations on survival set forth in SECTION 8.1 of
this Agreement shall apply to Damages which arise out of fraud by any party
hereto or any Affiliate of such party.   SECTION 8.4 TAX
INDEMNIFICATION.   (a) Following the Closing, Parent and Seller shall,
jointly and severally, indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties (including
the Companies) and hold them harmless from (i) all Liability for Taxes of
Newco and AHCGC (including any obligation to contribute to the payment of a
Tax determined on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis with respect to a
group of corporations that includes or included Newco or AHCGC, and any Taxes
resulting from the Elections except as provided in SECTION 6.7) for any Pre-
Closing Tax Periods (determined in accordance with the methodology provided
in SECTION 6.2(d)), (ii) all Liability (as a result of Regulation Section
1.1502-6(a) or otherwise) for Taxes of Parent, Seller, Canadian Seller
(including all Liability for Property Taxes arising out of the ownership of
the Canadian Assets for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (determined on a per diem
basis consistent with the methodology of SECTION 8.4(c)(i)) or any other
entity which is or has been an Affiliate of Newco or AHCGC (other than Newco
and AHCGC), (iii) any and all Damages arising out of, resulting from or
incident to any breach by Parent, Seller, or any of their Affiliates (other
than, after the Closing, Newco and AHCGC) of any covenant contained in
SECTION 4.1(xxiii) or (xxiv) or ARTICLE VI, (iv) any and all Damages arising
out of, resulting from or incident to the breach of any representation or
warranty made by Parent or Seller in SECTION 2.19 without regard to any
qualification contained therein as to materiality or a Material Adverse
Effect, except to the extent that any such Damages are otherwise indemnified
pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i) - (iii), and (v) any and all Damages
arising out of, resulting from or incident to the breach of
any representation or warranty made by Parent or Seller in SECTION 2.19
without regard to any qualification contained therein as to materiality or
Material Adverse Effect as if such representation or warranty were made on or
as of the Closing Date (except in the case of any representation or warranty
that by its terms is made as of a date specified therein), except to the
extent that any such Damages are otherwise indemnified pursuant to the
foregoing clauses (i) - (iv). For purposes of this SECTION 8.4(a), Taxes
shall include the amount of Taxes which would have been paid but for the
application of any credit or net operating loss or capital loss deduction
attributable to Post-Closing Tax Periods.    E-86  87   (b) Following
the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties and
hold them harmless from (i) all Liability for Taxes of Newco and AHCGC
(including any obligation to contribute to the payment of a Tax determined on
a consolidated, combined or unitary basis with respect to a group of
corporations that includes or included one or more of Newco or AHCGC) for any
Post-Closing Tax Period (determined in accordance with the
methodology provided in SECTION 6.2(d)), (ii) any and all Damages arising out
of, resulting from or incident to the breach by Purchaser of any covenant
contained in ARTICLE VI of this Agreement and (iii) all Liability for
Property Taxes arising out of the ownership of the Canadian Assets for any
Post-Closing Tax Period (determined on a per diem basis consistent with the
methodology of SECTION 8.4(c)(i)).   (c) In the case of any Straddle
Period:   (i) real, personal and intangible property Taxes ("PROPERTY
TAXES") of Seller or its Affiliates for a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during
the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period (including that
portion of the Straddle Period in which any of the Assets were owned
by Seller) and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the
Straddle Period; and   (ii) the Taxes of Newco or AHCGC (other than
Property Taxes) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if such
Taxable Period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date (which
shall be the deemed the time of Closing as provided in SECTION 1.5 and which
shall include the tax consequences of the Share Purchase and the
Elections).   (d) With respect to Parent and Seller\'s indemnity
obligations in respect of Taxes for a Straddle Period, Seller shall pay to
Purchaser an amount equal to any such Taxes allocable to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period in accordance with SECTION 8.4(c) less the sum of (i) the amount of
such allocable Taxes paid by Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than
Newco or AHCGC) at any time and (ii) the amount of such Taxes paid by Newco
and AHCGC on or prior to the Closing Date (collectively, (i) and (ii), the
"STRADDLE PERIOD TAX OFFSET") within ten (10) days after written demand
thereof is made by Purchaser (but in no event earlier than five (5) days
before the date on which the Taxes for the Straddle Period are required to be
paid to the relevant Taxing Authority). If the amount of the Straddle Period
Tax Offset exceeds the amount of such Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period within such Straddle Period, Purchaser shall pay to Parent the amount
of such excess within ten (10) days after the Tax Return with respect to the
final liability for such Taxes is required to be filed with the relevant
Taxing Authority. In the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance with
the provisions of SECTION 8.4(e), payment of the Tax to the appropriate
Taxing Authority shall not be considered to be due earlier than the date a
final determination to such effect is made by the appropriate
Taxing Authority or court.   (e) (i) If a claim shall be made by any Taxing
Authority, which, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment to a
party (the "FIRST PARTY"), one of its Affiliates or any of its
Representatives pursuant to this SECTION 8.4, the First Party shall promptly
and in any event no more than thirty (30) days following the First Party\'s
receipt of such claim, give written    E-87  88   notice to the other
party (the "SECOND PARTY") of such claim (a "TAX CLAIM"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
the failure of the First Party to give such notice shall only relieve the
Second Party from its indemnification obligations hereunder to the extent it
is actually prejudiced by such failure.   (ii) With respect to any Tax Claim
relating to a Taxable Period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, Parent
shall, upon written notification to Purchaser, control all proceedings and
may make all decisions taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including
selection of counsel) at its own expense; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that with
respect to Tax Claims the resolution of which will be binding on Newco or
AHCGC in a Tax Period ending after the Closing Date, then Purchaser may also
participate in such proceeding at its own expense and Parent may not settle
such Tax Claim without the written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld). Parent and Purchaser shall jointly control all
proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim relating to Taxes of Newco
or AHCGC for a Straddle Period. Purchaser shall control at its own expense
all proceedings with respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Taxable Period
beginning after the Closing Date. A party shall promptly notify the other
party if it decides not to control the defense or settlement of any Tax Claim
which it is entitled to control pursuant to this Agreement, and the other
party shall thereupon be permitted to defend and settle such proceeding.  
(iii) Parent and Purchaser and each of their respective Affiliates shall
reasonably cooperate with each other in contesting any Tax Claim. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and, upon the request of the party or
parties controlling proceedings relating to such Tax Claim, the provision to
such party or parties of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to such Tax Claim, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of any
material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax
Claim.   SECTION 8.5 EXCLUSIVITY OF INDEMNIFICATION REMEDY. Except for any
equitable relief, including injunctive relief or specific performance,
to which any party hereto may be entitled, from and after the Closing
the indemnification provided in this ARTICLE VIII shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of any party hereto with respect to this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, except for rights of set-off as to obligations arising
under this Agreement (excluding any obligations arising under the Transition
Services Agreement), which the parties hereto hereby establish and
acknowledge.   ARTICLE IX .  TERMINATION AND WAIVER   SECTION 9.1

Closing:   (a) by either Parent or Purchaser if the Closing shall not have

failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date;   (b) by either
Parent or Purchaser in the event that any Governmental Authority shall have
issued a final, non-appealable order, decree, ruling or injunction (other

derived from the Initial Financial Statements for the periods ended December

cause it financial and legal advisors to, negotiate in good faith with Seller
and Parent as to such matters and, if appropriate, to make such adjustments
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements as
would result in Purchaser agreeing to proceed with the transactions
contemplated hereby. If the Statement Notice shall not be given by Purchaser
within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Subsequent Financial Statements
in conformance with the requirements of SECTION 4.18 this termination right
shall cease;   (d) by the mutual written consent of Parent and
Purchaser;   (e) by Seller upon written notice in the event of a
material breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in

Antitrust Laws in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby) or
any covenant or agreement to be performed or complied with by Purchaser
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, which breach (i) has continued

been waived by Seller in writing);   (f) by Purchaser upon written notice in
the event of a material breach of any representation or warranty of Seller or
Parent contained in this Agreement (other than a breach of the
representations in SECTION 2.3(b) relating to a Governmental Order entered

transactions contemplated hereby) or any     E-89  90  covenant or
agreement to be performed or complied with by Seller, Parent or the Companies

either Purchaser or Parent, if either (i) the Parent and Purchaser shall have
agreed to not further resist or contest actions or proceedings under or

accordance with SECTION 4.29 and Purchaser has not provided Parent with a
Limitation of Indemnification Notice at least two (2) Business Days prior to
Closing.   SECTION 9.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of
termination of this Agreement as provided in SECTION 9.1, this Agreement
