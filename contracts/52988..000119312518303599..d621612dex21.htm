Section 2.11. _Preliminary Closing Statement; Payment of Preliminary
Purchase Price_.

(a) No later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer a preliminary closing statement setting forth its good
faith estimates of the Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Cash, and the
Closing Date Indebtedness and the resulting Preliminary Purchase Price (the "
_Preliminary Closing Statement_ "). The Preliminary Closing Statement shall
be prepared in good faith in accordance with the Calculation Principles and in
a manner consistent with the Sample Closing Statement. For illustrative
purposes only, attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ is a Sample Closing Statement
based upon the Balance Sheet and assuming the Closing were to occur as of the
Balance Sheet Date (the " _Sample Closing Statement_ "). Buyer shall promptly
(and, in any event, no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date) provide Seller with any comments to the Preliminary Closing Statement in
writing, setting forth in reasonable detail Buyers good faith estimate of any
amount set forth in the Preliminary Closing Statement with which Buyer
disagrees. After considering Buyers comments, Seller shall make such
revisions to the Preliminary Closing Statement as are mutually agreed by Buyer
and Seller in writing, if any, and shall deliver a copy of such revised
Preliminary Closing Statement, if any, to Buyer prior to the Closing;
_provided_ , that Seller has sole discretion to accept or reject any revisions
to the Preliminary Closing Statement proposed by Buyer and Buyer may
not challenge or appeal Sellers decision. The estimate set forth in the
Preliminary Closing Statement initially delivered by Seller to Buyer, as
modified by the resolution of any comments agreed to by Buyer and Seller in
writing, shall be the basis for determining the Preliminary Purchase Price.

 



31|

    

(b) The " _Preliminary Purchase Price_ " shall equal: (i) Three Billion
Three Hundred Million Dollars ($3,300,000,000), __plus__ (ii) the estimate of
Closing Date Cash reflected on the Preliminary Closing Statement, __minus__
(iii) the excess (if any) of the Target Net Working Capital over the estimate
of Net Working Capital reflected on the Preliminary Closing Statement,
__plus__ (iv) the excess (if any) of the estimate of Net Working Capital
reflected on the Preliminary Closing Statement over the Target Net Working
Capital, __minus__ (v) the estimate of Closing Date Indebtedness reflected on
the Preliminary Closing Statement.

 

(c) The Preliminary Purchase Price shall be paid at the Closing as follows:

 

(i) Buyer shall validly issue and deliver to Seller the CHESS holding
statement representing 58,197,867 fully paid and nonassessable Buyer Ordinary
Shares (the " _Share Consideration_ "); and

(ii) Buyer shall deliver an aggregate amount of cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by Seller, equal to
the Preliminary Purchase Price, __minus__ $700,000,000 (such amount, the "
_Cash Consideration_ ").

 

(d) With respect to the Share Consideration:

 

(i) This Agreement serves as an application by Seller for the subscription
for, and issue of, the Share Consideration and accordingly, it will not be
necessary for Seller to provide a separate additional application on or prior
to Closing.

 

(ii) Upon the issuance of the Share Consideration to Seller, Seller agrees
to become a member of Buyer and to be bound by Buyers constitution in
respect of the Share Consideration.

 

Section 2.12. _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable, but in any event within ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a combined
balance sheet of the Business as of 11:59 p.m. on the Friday before the
Closing Date together with a final closing statement, reflecting Buyers good
faith calculation of the Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Cash, the
Closing Date Indebtedness, and the resulting Purchase Price (collectively, the
" _Final Closing Statement_ "). The Final Closing Statement shall be prepared
in good faith in accordance with the Calculation Principles, in a manner
consistent with the Sample Closing Statement and accompanied by reasonable
supporting documentation used by Buyer in the preparation of the Final Closing
Statement. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.12_ is intended to be used to
adjust for errors, omissions or inconsistencies that may be found with respect
to the Financial Statements, the Balance Sheet, or the Sample Closing
Statement, or any actual or alleged failure of the Financial Statements, the
Balance Sheet, or the Sample Closing Statement to be prepared in accordance
with GAAP. The Parties shall not be permitted to introduce different
accounting principles, procedures, policies, practices, estimates, judgments
or methodologies in the preparation of the Final Closing Statement or the
determination of the Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Cash, or the
Closing Date Indebtedness from those set forth in the Calculation Principles.

 

(b) Seller may dispute Buyers calculations set forth in the Final Closing
Statement (or any element thereof) by notifying Buyer in writing, setting
forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement (the " _Notice
of Objection_ "), within ninety (90) calendar days after Sellers receipt of
the 

 



32|

    

 Final Closing Statement. Any item or amount as to which no dispute is raised
in the Notice of Objection will be final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties for all purposes hereunder. In the event that Seller does not deliver
a Notice of Objection to Buyer within such ninety (90) calendar day period or
Seller accepts the Final Closing Statement in writing, Seller shall be deemed
to have accepted Buyers calculation of the Final Purchase Price set forth in
the Final Closing Statement and the Final Closing Statement (including the
determination of the Purchase Price thereunder) shall be final and binding
upon the Parties. In connection with the review by Seller of the Final
Closing Statement or any dispute pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.12_, Buyer
shall (i) permit Seller and its Representatives to have reasonable access to
the books, records and other documents pertaining to or used in connection
with the preparation of the Final Closing Statement and the calculation of the
Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Cash, or the Closing Date Indebtedness,
(ii) provide Seller and its Representatives reasonable access to employees
and accountants of Buyer as reasonably requested by Seller to verify the
accuracy of the Final Closing Statement, and (iii) cause the employees and
accountants of Buyer to reasonably cooperate in all material respects in
connection with such review. In the event that a Notice of Objection is timely
delivered, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith for a period of thirty
(30) days after Buyers receipt of the Notice of Objection, or such longer
period as the Parties may agree in writing, to resolve any disagreements set
forth in the Notice of Objection. Any communications between the Parties (or
their respective Representatives) during the aforementioned thirty (30) day
period shall be treated as settlement discussion materials pursuant to
Federal Rule of Evidence 408 and similar state rules.

 

(c) If the Parties are unable to resolve any such disagreement within such
thirty (30) day period (or such longer period as the Parties shall have
agreed in writing), then an independent accounting firm of recognized national
standing as may be mutually selected by the Parties (the " _Independent Firm_
") shall be appointed, as an expert and not an arbitrator, to resolve any
items that remain in dispute at the end of such period (the " _Unresolved
Items_ "), but in no case shall the Independent Firm review or propose any
resolution for any matters that have not been raised in the Notice of
Objection. If the Parties are not able to mutually select an independent
accounting firm of recognized national standing within ten (10) days, then
Seller shall within ten (10) days of such failure to agree deliver to Buyer
a listing of three (3) accounting firms of nationally recognized standing
(none of which have worked in the past three (3) years for Seller or Buyer or
any of their respective Subsidiaries) and Buyer shall within ten (10) days
after receipt of such list, select one of such three (3) accounting firms to
act as the Independent Firm.

(d) The Parties shall instruct the Independent Firm to resolve the
Unresolved Items as promptly as practicable, and in any event within ninety
(90) days after the date on which such dispute is referred to the Independent
Firm, based solely on the provisions of this Agreement, and the written
presentations by Seller and Buyer, and not on an independent review. In
resolving any Unresolved Item, the Independent Firm (i) may not assign a value
to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either
Party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Party,
(ii) may not take oral testimony from the Parties hereto or any other Person
but may submit interrogatories to the Parties and receive written responses
thereto, and (iii) shall not consider any facts that have occurred after the
Closing Date. Seller and Buyer shall give each other copies of any written
submissions at the same time as they are submitted to the Independent Firm.
Neither Buyer nor Seller shall have any ex parte communication with the
Independent Firm. Buyer shall bear and pay a percentage of the fees and
expenses of the Independent Firm that is equal to the percentage of the total
dollar amount of changes to the Purchase Price proposed by Seller that are
successful, and Seller shall bear and pay a percentage of the fees and
expenses of the Independent Firm that is equal to the percentage of the total
dollar amount of changes to the Purchase Price proposed by Seller that are
not successful, in each case, as determined by the Independent Firm. The
written determination of the Independent Firm shall, as promptly as
practicable, and in any event, within ninety (90) days after its appointment,
be delivered to the Parties and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties and constitute an arbitral award, absent fraud or manifest error. Upon
the decision of the Independent Firm, the Final Closing Statement as adjusted
to the extent necessary to reflect any agreement

 



33|

    

 between the Parties prior to or in lieu of submission to the Independent
Firm and the Independent Firms decision, shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the Parties and constitute an arbitral award, absent fraud or
manifest error.

(e) The " _Final Purchase Price_ " shall mean the Purchase Price set forth
on the Final Closing Statement as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.12_. If the Final Closing Statement as finally determined
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.12_ shows that an amount is due to Buyer
(because the Preliminary Purchase Price is greater than the Final Purchase
Price), Seller shall promptly, and in any event within three (3) Business
Days, pay such difference to Buyer, in cash. If the Final Closing Statement
shows that an amount is due to Seller (because the Preliminary Purchase Price
is less than the Final Purchase Price shown on the Final Closing Statement),
Buyer shall promptly pay such difference to Seller, in cash. Any payment
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.12(e)_ shall be made by Buyer or Seller, as
the case may be, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account or accounts of such other Party as may be designated by such other
Party in writing. In the event of a failure to timely make such payment,
interest shall accrue on such amount for the period commencing on the payment
due date through the date on which such payment is made calculated at the
Prime Rate. Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment to
which it relates and shall be calculated daily on the basis of a year of three
hundred and sixty-five (365) days and the actual number of days elapsed. The
Parties shall treat all payments made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.12_
as adjustments to the Preliminary Purchase Price for Tax purposes to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 2.13. _Allocation of the Transaction Consideration_. __
Within sixty (60) days after the final determination of the Final Purchase
Price pursuant to the terms of _Section_ __ _ 2.12_, Seller shall deliver to
Buyer an allocation of the Final Purchase Price (together with liabilities
and other items required to be included in the purchase price for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) among the Transferred Interests (and the assets
of any Transferred Entity for which a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.08(a)_), the JV Interests and the Transferred
Assets consistent with Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code (the " _Initial
Allocation Statement_ "). Seller and Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve any disagreements with respect to the Initial
Allocation Statement within thirty (30) days following Sellers delivery of
the Initial Allocation Statement. The Initial Allocation Statement, as
prepared by Seller (if Buyer does not provide notice of any disagreement), or
as modified to reflect the resolution of any disagreements between Seller and
Buyer, shall be referred to as the " _Final Allocation Statement_." After the
Closing, the Parties and their respective Affiliates will consistently use
the allocations set forth in the Final Allocation Statement (if any) for U.S.
federal, state, local and other (including non-U.S.) Tax purposes, including
for any Tax Returns and any forms or reports required to be filed pursuant to
Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code (including Internal Revenue Service Forms
8594 and 8883), or any comparable provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax
Law, and in any administrative or judicial proceeding relating to Taxes, and
such Parties agree that none of them will assert or maintain a position
inconsistent with the foregoing, except as may be otherwise required by
applicable Law. Any subsequent adjustment to the Purchase Price in accordance
with this Agreement will be allocated in a manner consistent with the Final
Allocation Statement (if any). For the avoidance of doubt, if the Parties are
unable to resolve any disagreements with respect to the Initial Allocation
Statement, each of the Parties may separately determine the allocation.

 

Section 2.14. _Withholding_. Buyer and the Buyer Designees shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the payment of any proceeds payable to
any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts that are required to be
deducted and withheld under applicable Tax Law. To the extent that Buyer or a
Buyer Designee withholds such amounts and timely remits such withheld amounts
to the applicable Taxing Authority (and provides evidence of such remittance
to Seller), such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been delivered and paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. Buyer shall notify Seller promptly, and in
any event no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, in
writing if Buyer determines that any withholding or 

 



34|

    

 deduction is required under any provision of Tax Law with respect to any
portion of any such payment (and such notice shall describe the basis for such
deduction or withholding) and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller
(and permit Seller to provide forms or certificates) to eliminate or reduce
any such required deduction or withholding (including through the provision by
Seller of forms or certificates); provided, however, that no such notice is
required to be provided with respect to amounts that are required to be
deducted or withheld under Section 1445 of the Code as a result of the failure
to deliver the documentation in _Section 2.10(a)(ix)_.

Section 3.06. _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Seller has made available to Buyer prior to the date hereof, unaudited
reviewed Special Purpose Statement of Net Assets (the " _Balance Sheet_ ") as
of June 29, 2018 of the Business and the related Special Purpose Statements of
Revenues and Direct Expenses for the twelve-month periods ended June 29, 2018
and June 30, 2017, and the related notes to the special purpose statements
(collectively, and together with the notes, schedules or other supplementary
information thereto and a review report thereon by Sellers independent
certified public accountant, the " _Financial Statements_ "), true and
complete copies of which are set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.06(a)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule. The Financial Statements (A) fairly present in all
material respects the financial condition of the Business as of the
respective dates or for the respective time periods set forth therein, and (B)
have been derived from Sellers consolidated financial information that has
been prepared in accordance with GAAP (subject to the absence of certain
footnotes and normal year-end adjustments, none of which would be material).

 

(b) Seller maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) as required
by Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act and that is sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are executed only in
accordance with managements general or specific authorizations, (ii) access
to assets of Seller or its Subsidiaries is permitted only in accordance with
managements general or specific authorization, and (iii) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.
Seller (i) has designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as required by
Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act and that provide reasonable
assurance that all material information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by Seller related to the Business in the reports that
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms
and is accumulated and communicated to Sellers management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (ii) has disclosed
to Sellers auditors (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting of
Seller, and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in Sellers internal controls
over financial reporting.

(c) This _Section_ __ _ 3.06_ is qualified by the fact that the Business
has not operated as a separate "stand alone" entity within Seller. As a
result, the Business has been allocated certain internal charges and credits
for purposes of the preparation of the Financial Statements. Such allocations
of charges and credits have been made in good faith with the intent of
accurately presenting to the extent practicable the financial condition and
results of operations of the Business for the time periods covered by the
Financial Statements, but may not necessarily reflect the amounts that would
have resulted from arms-length transactions or the actual costs that would be
incurred if the Business operated as an independent enterprise.

made

to  _Section_ __ _ 3.13_)), the Business and each Transferred Entity and, to
the Knowledge of Seller, each JV Entity is and for the past one (1) year has
been, in material compliance with all Laws and Orders applicable to
the Business, the Transferred Assets, the Transferred Entities and the JV

neither Seller, any Transferred Entity nor to the Knowledge of Seller, any JV
Entity, has received a written communication from or entered into any Contract
or settlement with, a Governmental Authority that alleges that the
Business, any Transferred Entity or any JV Entity has, at any time, not been
in material compliance with any Law or Order applicable to the Business, the
Transferred Assets, the Transferred Entities or the JV Entities, except to the
extent that any non-compliance would not be material to the Business as a
whole. To Sellers Knowledge, neither Seller, the Business, any Transferred
Entity or any JV Entity is being investigated for or charged by
any Governmental Authority with a material violation of, any Law applicable
to the Business or any Transferred Entity or JV Entity, except to the extent
that any such violation would not be material to the Business as a whole.

 

(b) Seller and its Subsidiaries possess all permits, approvals, Orders,
authorizations, consents, licenses, certificates, franchises, variances,
concessions and exemptions of, or filings or registrations with, or issued by,
any Governmental Authority (" _Permits_ ") necessary for the operation of the
Business as currently conducted, except where such failure would not
reasonably be expected to be material to the Business, as a whole. All such
Permits are in full force and effect, and there are no Actions pending or, to
Sellers Knowledge, threatened by any Governmental Authority that seek the
revocation, cancellation, suspension or adverse modification thereof, except
where such failure would not reasonably be expected to be material to the
Business, as a whole. Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
default, and, to the Knowledge of Seller, no condition exists that with
notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default, under any such
Permits, except where such failure would not reasonably be expected to be
material to the Business, as a whole.

respective officers or directors or, to the Knowledge of Seller, any of their
respective employees or agents of Seller, in each case, solely to the extent

or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the Business, in the past three
(3) years, directly or indirectly:

(i) unlawfully made, offered or promised to make or offer any payment,
loan or transfer of anything of value, including any reward, advantage or
benefit of any kind, directly or indirectly to or for the benefit of any
Government Official, for the purpose of (A) inducing such Government Official
to do or omit to do any act in violation of a lawful duty, (B) obtaining or
retaining business for or with any person, or (C) otherwise securing any
improper advantage;

in each case in any respect material to the Business.

(d) There have been no intentionally false or fictitious entries made in
the books or records of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, with respect to the
Business, relating to any illegal payment or secret or unrecorded fund, and
neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has established or maintained
a secret or unrecorded fund with respect to the Business, in each case in any
respect material to the Business. Seller and its Subsidiaries maintain
policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure compliance in all
material respects with all applicable Anti-Corruption Laws.

following such cancellation such limitation, restriction, right, covenant or

(ii) any Contract that by its terms provides for payments by or to the

of Seller, of the other party or parties thereto and enforceable in accordance
with its terms, except as limited by Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally, by general equitable principles or by the
discretion of any Governmental Authority before which any Action seeking
enforcement may be brought. Each Asset Seller, Transferred Entity and to
Sellers Knowledge, each JV Entity has performed all obligations required to
be performed by it under each Material Contract to which it is a party and is
not otherwise in material default or material breach of, and since January 1,
2017 none of the Asset Sellers, Transferred Entities or JV Entities have
received any written notice of any default or breach or event that, with
notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default or breach by the
Asset Sellers, Transferred Entities or JV Entities under any Material
Contract, except, in each case, where such failure would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the Business, as a whole. Neither Seller nor any of
its Subsidiaries has delivered notice of any default or breach or event under
(nor, to the Knowledge of Seller, does there exist any condition which upon
the passage of time or the giving of notice or both, would cause a default or
breach or event under) any Material Contract by any counterparty thereto,
except, in each case, where such failure would not reasonably be expected to
be material to the Business, as a whole.

Section 3.16. _Insurance_.  _Section_ __ _ 3.16_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all material
policies of property, liability, workers compensation and other forms of
insurance owned or held by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries insuring the
business, equipment, properties, assets, operations and employees (including
officers and directors) of the Business (" _Seller Insurance Policies_ ").
There is no material claim in respect of the Business pending under any such
policy as to which coverage has been denied or disputed by the insurer of such
Seller Insurance Policies or in respect of which such insurer has reserved its
rights. Each insurance policy which (a) constitutes a Transferred Asset, or
(b) which provides Transferred Coverage, is in full force and effect in all
material respects, all premiums due and payable thereon have been paid, no
written notice that any such insurance policy is no longer in force or effect
has been received by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, and Seller or the
Subsidiary of Seller who is the insured is in compliance in all material
respects with the applicable terms and conditions of such insurance policy.
Except any shortfall as would not reasonably be expected to materially
interfere with the conduct of the Business in substantially the manner
currently conducted, the coverage under the Seller Insurance Policies, is
adequate to satisfy all of the contractual insurance obligations required
under the terms of any Material Contract, Permit or any Law applicable to the
Business.

 Section 3.17. _Real Property_.

(a) The Real Property constitutes all of the material real property that
is used or held for use primarily in the conduct of the Business as currently
conducted. No Person other than Seller and its Subsidiaries has the right to
use or occupy the Real Property. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of
Seller, threatened condemnation proceedings with respect to any Real Property.

(b) _Section 3.17(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true, correct and complete list of all Owned Real Property including with
respect to each Owned Real Property, the Seller or its Subsidiary that owns
such Owned Real Property and the address, location and use of such Owned Real
Property. None of Seller, any other Asset Seller, Transferred Entity or JV
Entity has received any written notice from any Governmental Authority, that
any of the improvements on the Owned Real Property 

 



47|

    

 or the use or operation thereof in the conduct of the Business violates
(other than a permitted non-conformance) in a material respect any use or
occupancy restriction or other Lien affecting such Owned Real Property or any
zoning Law applicable thereto. None of the Owned Real Property is the subject
of any lease, sublease, or other occupancy agreement granting to another
Person any right to the possession, use, occupancy or enjoyment of the Owned
Real Property. There are no agreements or options that remain in effect
granting to any Person the right to acquire any of the Owned Real Property or
any interest therein.

 

(c) _Section 3.17(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list
of all Leased Real Property, in each case identifying the instrument creating
the Leased Real Property (each, a " _Real Property Lease_ "), and the identity
of Seller or the Subsidiary of Seller that is the current lessee, sublessee,
grantee or licensee thereunder (the " _Lessee_ "), as applicable. There is no
sublease or assignment or other occupancy agreement in favor of any third
party currently in effect in respect of the Leased Real Property. Each Real
Property Lease is a valid and binding agreement of Seller or such of its
Subsidiaries that are party thereto, and to the Knowledge of Seller, of the
other party or parties thereto and enforceable in accordance with its terms,
except as limited by Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally, by general equitable principles or by the discretion of any
Governmental Authority before which any Action seeking enforcement may be
brought, and except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to result in material Liability to Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or otherwise materially interfere with the
conduct of the Business in substantially the manner currently conducted. To
the Knowledge of Seller, no other party to a Real Property Lease is in
default of such Real Property Lease, except for any such defaults that would
not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, result in
material Liability to the Business, or otherwise materially interfere with
the conduct of the Business in substantially the manner currently conducted.
Accurate and complete copies of each Real Property Lease, including all
amendments and supplements thereto, have been made available by Seller
to Buyer in each case prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

Section 3.18. _Title to Assets; Sufficiency of Assets_.

 

(a) The Asset Sellers, the Transferred Entities and the JV Entities have
good and marketable title to, valid leasehold interests in, or a valid
license to use or occupy, in all material respects, all of the Transferred
Assets, in each case, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.

 

(b) The Transferred Assets, the Shared Corporate Contracts, and any
services, assets, properties, rights, titles or interests made available to
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing pursuant to this
Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the Subleases and the Assignment
Agreements, constitute all of the assets, properties, rights, titles and
interests necessary to operate the Business immediately following the Closing,
in all material respects, in substantially the same manner the Business was
conducted in the twelve (12) month period immediately prior to Closing; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the benefits of certain Transferred Assets that
cannot be transferred, conveyed or assigned at Closing will be provided to
Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.07_.

 

Section 3.19. _Related Party Transactions_.

 

(a) No executive officer or director of the Business is (i) party to any
material Contract or other business arrangement (other than employment,
retention or similar agreements and Plans entered into in the ordinary course
of business) with any Transferred Entity or JV Entity that is not terminable
at will by such Transferred Entity or JV Entity without payment or penalty,
or (ii) owns any material property or right, tangible or intangible, which is
used by the Business.

 

(b) _Section 3.19(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list
of agreements, arrangements or understandings solely between Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred

 



48|

    

 Entities and the JV Entities), on the one hand, and any Transferred Entity
or JV Entity, on the other hand, that are material to the operation of the
Business and that are not terminable at will without payment or penalty ("
_Affiliate Transactions_ "), other than (i) those agreements, arrangements or
understandings that are contemplated by or otherwise addressed in this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, (ii) those agreements,
arrangements or understandings that are contemplated by or otherwise addressed
in the Reorganization Documents, (iii) Intercompany Balances, that will be
terminated prior to or at the Closing, and (iv) Contracts with third parties.

Partners, whose fees shall be paid by Seller, no Person is or will be entitled
to a brokers, finders, investment bankers, financial advisers or similar
fee from any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or any Person acting on their
behalf in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 Section 3.21. _Anti-Money Laundering; International Trade Matters_.

(a) None of the Transferred Entities nor, to the Knowledge of Seller, the
JV Entities, or, with respect to the Business, Seller or its Subsidiaries, nor
their respective officers, directors, or employees, or to the Knowledge of
Seller, any agents acting on its or their behalf, is a Sanctioned Person.

(b) None of the Transferred Entities nor, to the Knowledge of Seller, the
JV Entities, or, with respect to the Business, Seller or its Subsidiaries is a
party to any Contract or bid with or has conducted any business directly or,
to Sellers Knowledge, indirectly within the past three (3) years
involving, (i) any Sanctioned Country or (ii) any Sanctioned Person, to the
extent in violation of Sanctions.

 

(c) Each of the Transferred Entities and, to the Knowledge of Seller, any
JV Entities, or, with respect to the Business, Seller and its Subsidiaries is
in compliance with all applicable Anti-Money Laundering Laws and International
Trade Laws.

 

(d) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened claim or
investigation against the Transferred Entities or JV Entities, or, with
respect to the Business, Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, nor has any Order
been imposed (or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened to be imposed) upon
the Transferred Entities or JV Entities, or, with respect to the Business,
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries by or before any Governmental Authority, nor
is there any pending voluntary disclosure to any Governmental Authority, in
each case, in connection with an alleged violation of any Anti-Money
Laundering Law or International Trade Law.

Business) (a) has any outstanding dispute with any Business Top Customer, or
(b) has, since January 1, 2017, received any written notice from any Business

Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.

 

Section 3.25. _Acknowledgements by Seller_.

 

(a) Seller acknowledges that it is not relying on any representation or
warranty of Buyer, other than those representations and warranties
specifically set forth in _ARTICLE IV_ of this Agreement. Seller acknowledges
and agrees that it has conducted to its satisfaction its own independent
review and analysis of Buyer, including the assets, financial condition,
results of operations and activities of Buyer and the nature and condition of
its properties, assets, Liabilities, businesses and prospects. Seller is an
informed and sophisticated purchaser, and has engaged expert advisors
and Representatives, experienced in the evaluation and purchase of interests
like the Buyer Ordinary Shares. Seller has undertaken such investigation and
has been provided with and has evaluated such documents and information as it
has deemed necessary to enable it to make an informed and intelligent
decision with respect to the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and has relied solely upon its
own investigation and the express representations and warranties set forth in
_ARTICLE IV_. Seller acknowledges that Buyer has given Seller access to its
employees, documents and facilities for the purpose of evaluating the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

 

(b) Seller acknowledges and agrees that none of Buyer or its Subsidiaries
or any other Person acting on behalf of them (i) has made any representation
or warranty, express or implied, including any implied representation or

Shares and the Share Consideration, Seller, its Subsidiaries and
Representatives may have received certain projections, including projected
statements of operating revenues and income from operations and certain budget
and business plan information. Seller acknowledges and agrees that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans, and that Seller is familiar with such uncertainties
and that Seller is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of
the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts
and plans so furnished to it, its Subsidiaries or its Representatives,
including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, 

 



50|

    

 projections and forecasts. Accordingly, Seller acknowledges and agrees that

representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections or
other forecasts and plans, including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, budgets, projections or forecasts (or any component
thereof).

information made available to Buyer by or on behalf of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Seller Review Documents_ ") are provided as
information only. Buyer shall not rely upon any Seller Review Document(s) in
lieu of conducting its own due diligence. Neither Seller, nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any other Person will have, or be subject to, any Liability
or other obligation to Buyer, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives or any other Person resulting from Buyers use of, or the use
by any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives of any Seller Review Documents.
Except for the specific representations and warranties contained in this
_ARTICLE III_ (in each case as modified by the Seller Disclosure Schedule),

Retained Businesses or the Retained Liabilities.

_ARTICLE III_ (IN EACH CASE AS MODIFIED BY THE SELLER DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE),

Section 4.12. _Purchase for Investment_. Buyer is purchasing the
Transferred Interests and JV Interests for investment for its own account and
not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof
in violation of any securities Law. Buyer (either alone or together with its
advisors) has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment in the Transferred Interests and the JV Interests and is
capable of bearing the economic risks of such investment. Buyer acknowledges
that the Transferred Interests and the JV Interests have not been registered
under any federal, state or foreign securities Laws and that the Transferred
Interests and the JV Interests may not be sold, transferred, offered for
sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of unless such transfer,
sale, assignment, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition is registered
under any federal, state or foreign securities Laws or is effected pursuant
to an exemption from registration under any federal, state or foreign
securities Laws.

 Section 4.13. _Acknowledgements by Buyer_.

(a) Buyer acknowledges that it is not relying on any representation or
warranty of Seller, other than those representations and warranties
specifically set forth in _ARTICLE III_ of this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that it has conducted to its satisfaction its own independent
review and analysis of the Business, including the assets, financial
condition, results of operations and activities of the Business, the
Transferred Entities, the JV Entities, the Transferred Assets and the nature
and condition of their respective properties, assets, Liabilities (including
the Assumed Liabilities) businesses and prospects. Buyer is an informed and
sophisticated purchaser, and has engaged expert advisors and Representatives,
experienced in the evaluation and purchase of companies, property and assets
such as the Business, the Transferred Entities, the JV Entities, the
Transferred Assets and their respective properties, assets, Liabilities
(including the Assumed Liabilities) businesses and prospects. Buyer has
undertaken such investigation and has been provided with and has evaluated
such documents and information as it has deemed necessary to enable it to make
an informed and intelligent decision with respect to the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and has
relied solely upon its own investigation and the express representations and
warranties set forth in _ARTICLE III_. Buyer acknowledges that Seller has
given Buyer access to the employees, documents and facilities of the
Business, the Transferred Assets, the JV Entities and the Transferred Entities
for the purpose of evaluating the transaction contemplated by the Transaction
Documents.

 

(b) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that none of Seller or its Subsidiaries
or any other Person acting on behalf of them (i) has made any representation
or warranty, express or implied, including any implied representation or
warranty as to the condition, merchantability, suitability or fitness for a
particular purpose of any assets of or held by the Business (including the
Transferred Assets), the Transferred Entities or the JV Entities, or (ii) has
made any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding the Business, the
Transferred Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Transferred Entities or the
JV Entities, in each case except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.

 

(c) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Transferred Assets and the
properties and assets of the Business, the Transferred Entities, and the JV
Entities are sold "as is", except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or
any other agreement or certificate executed and delivered in connection
herewith, including the Transaction Documents. Buyer and each Buyer Designee,
as applicable, agrees to accept the Transferred Assets and the properties and
assets of the Business, the Transferred Entities and the JV Entities in the
condition they are in on the Closing Date based on its own
inspection, examination and determination with respect to all matters, and
without reliance upon any express or implied representations or warranties of
any nature made by or on behalf of or imputed to Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, except as expressly set forth in _ARTICLE III_.

(d) In connection with Buyers investigation of the Business, the
Transferred Entities, the JV Entities, the Transferred Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities, Buyer, its Subsidiaries and Representatives may have received
certain projections, including projected statements of operating revenues and
income from operations of the Business, the Transferred Entities and the JV
Entities and certain budget and business plan information. Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, and that Buyer is
familiar with such uncertainties and that Buyer is taking full responsibility
for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it, its
Subsidiaries or its Representatives, including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts. Accordingly,
Buyer acknowledges and agrees that neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor any other Person is making any representation or warranty with respect to
such estimates, projections or other forecasts and plans, including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, budgets,
projections or forecasts (or any component thereof).

Section 4.14. _Buyer Reports; Financial Statements_.

(a) Buyer has timely filed or furnished all reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents required to be filed or furnished by it with
or to the ASX, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (as
required) since October 21, 2017 (the " _Buyer Reports_ "). As of its
respective date, or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment,
each of the Buyer Reports complied when filed or furnished (or, if applicable,
when amended) in all material respects with the requirements of the ASX, the
Australian Securities and Investment Commission and other Laws applicable to
such Buyer Reports, and none of the Buyer Reports when filed or furnished
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.

 

(b) The Buyer Financial Statements comply as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements, the Corporations Act, the
Australian Accounting Standards (the " _AAS_ ") and other authoritative
pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (the " _AASB_ "),
each as amended and other applicable Laws and represent a true and fair view
in all material respects of the financial position and the assets and
liabilities of Buyer and its Subsidiaries. The consolidated balance sheets
(including the related notes) included in the Buyer Financial Statements have
been prepared in accordance with the AAS and the AASB applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods presented and present fairly in all material
respects the financial position of Buyer and its Subsidiaries as at the
respective dates thereof, and the consolidated statements of income,
consolidated statements of shareholders equity and consolidated statements of
cash flows (in each case including the related notes) included in such Buyer
Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the AAS and the
AASB applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods presented and
present fairly in all material respects the results of operations,
shareholders equity and cash flows of Buyer and its Subsidiaries and for the
respective periods indicated. The Buyer Financial Statements (including the
related notes) are not affected by any material unusual, abnormal,
extraordinary or non-recurring items.

or violation of, or to Buyers Knowledge being investigated for or charged by
any Governmental Authority with a violation of, any Law applicable to Buyer or
a Buyer Designee, except for conflicts, defaults, violations, investigations
or charges that, individually or in the aggregate, have not resulted and
would not reasonably be expected to result in a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

 



56|

    

(b) Buyer and each Buyer Designee possess all permits, approvals, Orders,

concessions and exemptions of, or filings or registrations with, or issued by,
any Governmental Authority necessary for the operation of the business of
Buyer and such Buyer Designee as currently conducted (the " _Buyer Permits_
"), except when the failure to possess such Buyer Permit would not reasonably
be expected to be material to the Business, as a whole. All such Buyer Permits
are in full force and effect, and to Buyers Knowledge there are no Actions
pending or threatened by any Governmental Authority that seek the revocation,
cancellation, suspension or adverse modification thereof, except where such
failure would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Business, as a
whole. Neither Buyer nor any Buyer Designee is in default, and, to the
Knowledge of Buyer, no condition exists that with notice or lapse of time or
both would constitute a default, under any such Buyer Permits, except where
such failure would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Business,
as a whole.

 

(c) None of Buyer, the Buyer Designees, nor, to the Knowledge of Buyer, any
of their respective director, officer, employee, or agent (in each case,
solely to the extent that they are acting for or on behalf of Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries) has, in the past three (3) years, directly or indirectly,
(i) paid, offered, or agreed or promised to make or offer any bribe,
kickback, unlawful rebate or other similar unlawful payment of any nature to
or for the benefit of any Government Official for purposes of (A) inducing
such Governmental Official to do or omit to do any act in violation of
a lawful duty, (B) obtaining or retaining business for or with any person, or
(C) otherwise securing any improper advantage, or (ii) violated any applicable
Anti-Corruption Laws. There have been no intentionally false or
fictitious entries made in the books or records of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to any illegal payment or secret or unrecorded fund, and
neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries has established or maintained a
secret or unrecorded fund. Buyer and its Subsidiaries maintain policies and
procedures reasonably designed to ensure compliance with all applicable Anti-
Corruption Laws.

 Section 4.16. _Listing and Maintenance Requirements_.

(a) The Buyer Ordinary Shares are listed and quoted on the ASX and Buyer
is in compliance in all material respects with the ASX Listing Rules, and
Buyer has taken no action designed to, or which to its Knowledge is likely to
have the effect of, terminating the listing of Buyer Ordinary Shares under
the ASX Listing Rules nor has Buyer received any written notification that the
ASX is contemplating terminating such registration. Buyer is in material
compliance with the listing and maintenance requirements and any other
applicable rules and regulations of the ASX and the Australian Securities and
Investment Commission.

 

(b) Buyer (i) has complied in all material respects with its continuous
disclosure obligations under ASX Listing Rule 3.1, and (ii) as of the date
hereof, is not withholding any information from public disclosure in reliance
on ASX Listing Rule 3.1A (other than the information in relation to the
Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated therein and the
financing of those transactions).

Ordinary Shares or any other shareholder approval is required to be obtained
by Buyer in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, any of the Transaction Documents to which Buyer is, or at the

the specific representations and warranties contained in this _ARTICLE IV_
(in each case as modified by the Buyer Disclosure Schedule), none of Buyer,
any of its Subsidiaries, any of each of their respective Representatives, or
any other Person makes any express or implied representation or warranty,
including with respect to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, the Buyer Ordinary
Shares or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any other
Transaction Document or any Reorganization Document, and Buyer and its
Subsidiaries disclaim any other representations or warranties, whether made by
Buyer, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors,
managers, employees, agents or other Representatives. Any documents, title
information, assessments, surveys, plans, specifications, reports, studies,
projections or forecasts or other information made available to Seller by or
on behalf of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Buyer Review
Documents_ ") are provided as information only. Seller shall not rely upon any
Buyer Review Document(s) in lieu of conducting its own due diligence. Neither
Buyer, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any other Person will have, or
be subject to, any Liability or other obligation to Seller, its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective Representatives or any other Person resulting from
Sellers use of, or the use by any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives of
any Buyer Review Documents. Except for the specific representations and
warranties contained in this _ARTICLE IV_ (in each case as modified by the
Buyer Disclosure Schedule), neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any
other Person has made, and none of the foregoing is making, and have not
authorized anyone else to make, any representation as to: (a) the accuracy,
reliability or completeness of any of the Buyer Review Documents or (b) any
other matter or thing affecting or relating to Buyer, the Buyer Ordinary
Shares or the Share Consideration.

EXCEPT FOR THE SPECIFIC REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS
_ARTICLE IV_ (IN EACH CASE AS MODIFIED BY THE BUYER DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE),
BUYER AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY
FOR ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, PROJECTION, FORECAST, STATEMENT, OR

PROJECTION, OR ADVICE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN OR MAY BE PROVIDED TO SELLER BY ANY
DIRECTOR, OFFICER, MANAGER, EMPLOYEE, AGENT, CONSULTANT, OR REPRESENTATIVE OF
BUYER OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES). BUYER MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES TO SELLER REGARDING THE PROBABLE SUCCESS, PROFITABILITY OR VALUE OF
ANY OF BUYER, THE BUYER ORDINARY SHARES OR THE SHARE CONSIDERATION.

Representatives shall have access to (A) personnel records of the Business

secrets, or result in the waiver of any legal privilege or work-product
privilege, or (C) any document or information which constitutes proprietary
or competitively sensitive information ( _provided_ , that, in the case of
_clauses (ii)(B)_ through _(C)_ , Seller shall give notice to Buyer of the
fact that such documents or information are being withheld and thereafter
Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such documents
or information, as applicable, to be made available in a manner that would not
reasonably be expected to cause such a violation, disclosure or waiver or
reveal such information to a competitor).

(c) Seller shall have the right to have one or more
Representatives present at all times during any inspection, interview or
examination pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_. Buyer shall hold in
confidence all such information disclosed, whether before or after the date
hereof, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement and such information shall not be used by Buyer, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, other than in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or as otherwise
expressly permitted by the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, prior to the Closing, without the prior
written consent of Seller, which may be withheld in its sole discretion for
any reason, Buyer shall not contact any Business Employees or any vendors or
suppliers to, or customers, subcontractors or prime contractors of, Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries regarding the Business, this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents, the Reorganization or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby. In no event shall Buyer contact any employees, vendors or
suppliers to, or customers, subcontractors or prime contractors of, Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries about the Retained Businesses.

Section 5.04. _Efforts_. Each of Buyer, and, where applicable, Seller
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to (a)
consummate the Closing as promptly as reasonably practicable, and (b) cause
the satisfaction at the earliest practicable date of all of the conditions to
their respective obligations to consummate the Closing; _provided_ , that the
foregoing shall in no event be interpreted to require any Party to waive any
condition precedent to its obligations to consummate the Closing.

 

Section 5.05. _Regulatory Approvals_.

 

(a) Each of Buyer, and, where applicable, Seller shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause
to be done, and to assist and cooperate in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Law to make or cause to be made the
registrations, declarations and filings required of such Party under the HSR
Act and any other applicable Competition Law listed in _Section_ __ _
5.05(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (" _Competition Filings_ ") with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
reasonably practicable and advisable after the date of this Agreement (but in
any event file (x) the Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act no later
than ten (10) Business Days after the execution of this Agreement and (y) all
other Competition Filings as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
execution of this Agreement), and such initial filings from the Parties shall
request early termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act.
Each of Buyer and Seller agrees (i) not to withdraw or refile any filing or
extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or any other applicable
Competition Law or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority
not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except
with the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (ii) subject to applicable
Law, to furnish to the other party as promptly as reasonably practicable all
information required for any application or other filing to be made by the
other Party pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any inquiries received from, and supply as promptly as
reasonably practicable any additional information or documentation that may be
requested by, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the "
_DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade Commission (" _FTC_ ") or any other Governmental
Authority in respect of such Competition Filings, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) to promptly notify the other Party of
any material communication between that Party and the FTC, the DOJ or any
other Governmental Authority in respect of any Competition Filings or any
inquiry or Action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and of any material communication received or given in connection with
any Action by a private party relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby, (v) subject to applicable Law, to discuss with and permit the other
Party (and its counsel) to review in advance, and consider in good faith the
other Partys reasonable comments in connection with, any Competition

 



63|

    

 Filing or communication to the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental
Authority or, in connection with any Action by a private party to any other
Person, relating to any Competition Filing or inquiry or Action relating to
this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby, (vi) to not
participate or agree to participate in any substantive meeting, telephone call
or discussion with the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority in
respect of any Competition Filing, investigation or inquiry relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without consulting with the
other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such
Governmental Authority, giving the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meeting, telephone call or discussion, (vii) subject to
applicable Law, to furnish the other Party promptly with copies of all
correspondence, filings and communications between them and their Affiliates
on the one hand, and the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority or
members of their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to any
Competition Filing, inquiry or Action relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (viii) to act in good faith and
reasonably cooperate with the other Party in connection with any Competition
Filings and in connection with resolving any investigation or inquiry of any
such agency or other Governmental Authority under the HSR Act or any other
Competition Law with respect to any such Competition Filing, this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby. The Parties may, as they deem advisable,
designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other party
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.05_ as "outside counsel only." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
outside counsel of the recipient and shall not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient without the
advance written consent of the disclosing Party. Any filing fees associated
with the Competition Filings shall be paid by Buyer.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Buyer shall take
any and all steps necessary to (i) resolve, avoid or eliminate any and all
impediments or objections that may be asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby under any Competition Law, and (ii) avoid the
entry of, effect the dissolution of, and have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned, any Order that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case so as to
enable the Parties hereto to consummate the Closing expeditiously (and in any
event prior to the Outside Date). Without limiting the foregoing, to the
extent necessary to comply with the immediately preceding sentence, Buyer
shall propose, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold
separate orders or otherwise, the sale, divesture, disposition or license, and
otherwise take or commit to take any and all actions that after the Closing
Date would limit Buyers and its Subsidiaries freedom of action, ownership
or control with respect to, or its or their ability to retain, one or more of
the assets, properties, businesses, product lines or services of Buyer, the
Transferred Entities, the JV Entities or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or any interest or interests therein (each a " _Divestiture Action_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall require Buyer to
commit to or effect any such Divestiture Action that, individually or in the
aggregate, would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in the sale,
divesture, disposition or license of assets of Buyer and its Subsidiaries
(including all assets acquired pursuant to this Agreement) which generated
EBITDA during the period from June 30, 2017 to June 30, 2018 in excess of the
amount set forth on _Section_ __ _ 5.05(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule. If requested by Buyer, Seller shall agree to such Divestiture Action
(subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.05(b)_);
_provided_ , that any such agreement or action is conditioned upon
consummation of the Closing. In addition, Buyer shall defend through
litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to
avoid entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed, overturned or
terminated, any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would
restrain, prevent or delay the Closing or any closing pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 2.07_ including by pursuing all available avenues of administrative and
judicial appeal and all available legislative action.

 

(c) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, acquire or
agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a
substantial portion of the assets of or Equity Interests in, or by any other
manner, any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to
acquire any

 



64|

    

 assets or Equity Interests, if the entering into of a definitive agreement
relating to or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation
would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or
increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorizations, consents, orders,
declarations or approvals of any Governmental Authority necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period under any Competition Laws,
(ii) increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or
(iii) delay the consummation of the Closing.

(d) The Parties shall cooperate to submit a draft joint voluntary notice
to CFIUS with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
" _Draft CFIUS Filing_ ") as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of
this Agreement. After receipt of confirmation that CFIUS has no further
comments or inquiries related to the Draft CFIUS Filing, the Parties shall
promptly submit a formal joint voluntary notice to CFIUS with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _CFIUS Filing_ "). The
Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to comply at the earliest
practicable time, and in any event no later than required by CFIUS or any
CFIUS member agency, with any request for additional information, documents
or other materials, and will use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate
with each other in connection with both the Draft CFIUS Filing and the CFIUS
Filing and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of
CFIUS or any CFIUS member agency. The Parties shall each use their reasonable
best efforts to promptly inform the other Party of any oral communication
with, and provide copies of written communications with, CFIUS or any CFIUS
member agency regarding any such filings; _provided_ , that no Party shall be
required to share communications containing its confidential business
information if such confidential information is unrelated to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Parties shall undertake reasonable best
efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all action, and do, or cause
to be done all things necessary or advisable to obtain CFIUS Approval as soon
as reasonably practicable, including, but not limited to, executing a letter
of assurance or entering into another form of mitigation agreement with CFIUS
or CFIUS member agencies on terms, conditions, or measures sought by CFIUS,
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Party shall be required to take or
agree to take any undertaking that is not conditioned on the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 Section 5.06. _Shared Corporate Contracts_.

(a) The Parties acknowledge that the Shared Corporate Contracts relate to
both the Business and the Retained Businesses and will be retained by Seller
and its Subsidiaries (excluding the Transferred Entities and the JV Entities).
To the extent requested by Buyer in writing prior to the Closing, the Parties
shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, during the period
prior to the Closing and through the termination of all Services under the
Transition Services Agreement, cooperate and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate securing separate contracts
(the " _Buyer Replacement Contracts_ ") intended to provide Buyer, a Buyer
Designee, a JV Entity or a Transferred Entity with contract rights and
obligations that are substantially similar in the aggregate (taking into
account changes in volume and similar pricing metrics, as well as the needs of
Buyer and its Subsidiaries) to those contract rights and obligations utilized
by the Business prior to the Closing under such Shared Corporate Contracts.
Buyer shall be solely responsible for any costs, expenses or fees arising from
or under a Buyer Replacement Contract, or in connection with any arrangement
with respect thereto described in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.06_. No Party or
its Subsidiaries shall be required to commence any litigation or offer to
grant any material accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any counterparty
to any Shared Corporate Contract in furtherance of its obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.06_.

(b) If the Parties are not able to obtain a requested Buyer Replacement
Contract prior to the Closing, then, following the Closing until the date of
the termination of all Services under the Transition Services Agreement or the
earlier date on which such Buyer Replacement Contract is obtained,

 



65|

    

 to the extent permissible under applicable Law and under the terms of the
applicable Shared Corporate Contract, (i) at the sole cost and expense of
Buyer, Seller or the applicable Subsidiary of Seller shall continue to
perform the obligations under such Shared Corporate Contract relating to the
Business and operations of the Transferred Assets, the Transferred Entities
and the JV Entities, (ii) Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall take all such
actions necessary, or reasonably requested by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, to facilitate performance of the obligations under such Shared
Corporate Contract relating to the business and operations of the Transferred
Assets, the Transferred Entities and the JV Entities, (iii) Seller or the
applicable Subsidiary of Seller shall hold in trust for the benefit of Buyer,
and shall promptly forward to Buyer, any monies or other benefits received
pursuant to such Shared Corporate Contract relating to the Business and
operations of the Transferred Assets, the Transferred Entities and the JV
Entities, and (iv) the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
institute alternative arrangements intended to put the Parties in a
substantially similar economic position as if such Shared Corporate Contract
had been replaced by a Buyer Replacement Contract. Buyer shall be solely
responsible for replacing any Shared Corporate Contracts to the extent a
Buyer Replacement Contract is not obtained pursuant to the terms of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.06_. Buyer shall pay, and fully indemnify and hold harmless
Seller and its Subsidiaries in respect of all costs, expenses, fees or
other Liabilities owed pursuant to, under or relating to any Shared Corporate
Contract relating to the business and operations of the Transferred Assets,
the Transferred Entities and the JV Entities. In determining any such costs,
expenses, fees or other Liabilities pursuant to, under or relating to a given
Shared Corporate Contract, such costs, expenses, fees or other Liabilities
shall, unless otherwise allocated pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement, be allocated from time to time between Seller and its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, as the case may
be, based on the relative proportions of total benefits received (to the
extent the Liabilities relate to a specific period, over such period, and
otherwise over the term of the applicable Shared Corporate Contract, measured
up to the date of the allocation, without duplication) by Seller and its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the
Transferred Assets, the Transferred Entities and the JV Entities), on the
other hand, under the relevant Shared Corporate Contract. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer shall be solely responsible for, and fully indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Subsidiaries in respect of, any and all costs,
expenses, fees or other Liabilities to the extent arising out of or relating
to any breach of any such Shared Corporate Contract in connection with
complying with the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.06_ or the business
and operations of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred
Assets, the Transferred Entities and the JV Entities).

 

Section 5.07. _Affiliate Transactions; Intercompany Balances_.

 

(a) Except (i) as contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, (ii) as contemplated by the Reorganization Documents, or (iii) as
otherwise set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.07(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that all agreements, arrangements or
understandings solely between Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
the Transferred Entities or JV Entities), on the one hand, and a Transferred
Entity or a JV Entity, on the other hand, and all rights and obligations of
the Business, the Transferred Entities or the JV Entities under Contracts
with respect thereto (including all Affiliate Transactions), will be
terminated at or prior to the Closing, with no further Liability of Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities and the
JV Entities) with respect thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, no Contract
among Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Entities
or JV Entities), a Transferred Entity or a JV Entity, and a third party will
be terminated pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.07_.

(b) Seller shall cause all Intercompany Balances to be eliminated by
either settlement or discharge as appropriate or applicable or otherwise in
their entirety effective on or prior to the Closing with no further Liability
of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



66|

    

Section 5.08. _Third Party Approvals and Permits_. Except with respect to
the Mandatory Regulatory Approvals which are addressed in _Section_ __ _
5.05_, and Business Employee Approvals which are addressed in _ARTICLE VII_ ,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, prior to the earlier
of (a) the completion of the Reorganization and all closings pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.07_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.09_ and (b) the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, each Party shall, and shall
cause its respective Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all (i) Third Party Approvals, necessary to consummate the sale,
purchase and assumption of the Transferred Interests, the Transferred Assets
or the Assumed Liabilities, in each case as contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) Third Party Approvals necessary to transfer and assign the rights under
Contracts that constitute Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities or to
which any Transferred Entity is a party, and (iii) Third Party Approvals
necessary to transfer, reissue or obtain any Permits required to be
transferred, reissued or obtained as a result of or in furtherance of the
sale, purchase and assumption of the Transferred Interests, the JV Interests,
the Transferred Assets or the Assumed Liabilities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
incur any Liabilities or provide any non- _de minimis_ financial
accommodation, in order to obtain any such Third Party Approval.

 Section 5.09. _Business Guarantees_.

(a) Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to replace each
Business Guarantee set forth on _Section_ __ _ 5.09(a)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (a " _Section_ __ _ 5.09 Business Guarantee_") and obtain
from the respective beneficiary thereof, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Seller, on or before the Closing, valid and binding full and
unconditional releases of Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Transferred Entities and the JV Entities), as applicable, from any Liability,
whether arising before, on or after the Closing Date, under such Section 5.09
Business Guarantee effective as of the Closing. In furtherance of the
foregoing, Buyer shall (i) provide substitute guarantees with terms and
conditions that are at least as favorable to the counterparty as the terms of
the applicable Section 5.09 Business Guarantees, and (ii) furnish such letters
of credit, institute such escrow arrangements, post such surety
or performance bonds or make such other arrangements as the counterparty may
reasonably request (and in each case on terms and conditions that are at least
as favorable to the counterparty as the terms of the applicable Section 5.09
Business Guarantee). In respect of any Section 5.09 Business Guarantee that
is a letter of credit, Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
(A) cause the applicable beneficiary to accept a replacement letter of credit
issued by an existing or new financial institution for the account of Buyer,
(B) cause such existing letter of credit to be "rolled" into a new financing
agreement of Buyer (or one of its Subsidiaries) and the existing letter of
credit issuer and releasing Seller and its Subsidiaries with respect to any
obligation thereto, and/or (C) provide cash or other collateral or a letter of
credit or other credit back-stop in the full amount of such letter of credit
for the benefit of Seller or its applicable Subsidiary and the bank or
financial institution issuing such letter of credit. Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that it shall be solely responsible for ensuring that any credit
support provided pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.09_ satisfies all of the
credit support provisions of the applicable Contract, Law or Permit to which
it relates. Seller will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to (at no cost to any
of them), reasonably cooperate with Buyer (subject to _Section_ __ _
5.09(e))_ in connection with the performance of Buyers obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.09(a)_. For the avoidance of doubt, it is specifically
acknowledged and agreed by the Parties that neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be obligated to incur, pay, reimburse any cost or expense
or take on any Liability in order to replace the Section 5.09 Business
Guarantees.

 

(b) If any Section 5.09 Business Guarantee has not been released as of the
Closing, the Closing will proceed and Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, from and after the Closing, (i) use its commercially
reasonable efforts to as promptly as possible replace each Section 5.09
Business Guarantee and obtain from the respective beneficiary thereof, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller, valid and binding full
and unconditional releases of Seller and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, from
any Liability, whether arising before, on or after the Closing Date, under
such Section 5.09 Business

 



67|

    

 Guarantee, effective as of the Closing, including by continuing to undertake
all actions required pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.09(a)_, (ii) not effect any
amendments or modifications or any other changes to, or assign, authorize or
transfer to a third party, any Contracts, Permits or obligations to which any
of the Section 5.09 Business Guarantees relate, or otherwise take any action
that would reasonably be expected to materially increase, extend or
accelerate the Liability of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries under, any
Section 5.09 Business Guarantee, without Sellers prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Seller
will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to (at no cost to any of them),
reasonably cooperate with Buyer in connection with the performance of Buyers
obligations under clause _(i)_ of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.09(b)_.

(c) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Subsidiaries from and after the Closing for any losses or Liabilities arising
out of or relating to any Section 5.09 Business Guarantees (including
reimbursement immediately following demand therefor with respect to (A) any
out-of-pocket cost to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries of maintaining such
Business Guarantee, and (B) any demand or draw upon, or withdrawal from, any
Section 5.09 Business Guarantee). To the extent that any Section 5.09
Business Guarantee has any performance obligations from and after the Closing,
Buyer shall upon Sellers request (I) perform such obligations to the maximum
extent practicable, or (II) otherwise take such actions as may be requested
from time to time by Seller so as to put Seller and its Subsidiaries in the
same position as if Buyer had performed or was performing such obligations.

 

(d) The Parties shall cooperate, and each shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts, to cause the beneficiary or beneficiaries of each Section
5.09 Business Guarantee to (i) remit any cash and cash equivalents (including
any interest payable thereon) to Seller or its applicable Subsidiary held
under any escrow or cash collateral arrangement that is a Section 5.09
Business Guarantee promptly following the replacement of such escrow or cash
collateral arrangement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.09_, and (ii)
terminate, surrender and redeliver to Seller or its applicable Subsidiary
each original copy of the applicable Section 5.09 Business Guarantee.

(e) In connection with Sellers stated obligation to cooperate, and to
cause its Subsidiaries to cooperate, with Buyer under this _Section_ __ _
5.09_ relating to Section 5.09 Business Guarantees, neither Seller nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall in any event be required to (i) provide any assistance
that (A) is not requested by Buyer, or (B) shall unreasonably interfere with
its business operations, (ii) waive or amend any terms of this Agreement,
agree to incur any debt obligation (contingent or otherwise), or pay any fees
or reimburse any expenses for which it has not received prior reimbursement or
is not otherwise indemnified in a reasonably acceptable manner by or on behalf
of Buyer, (iii) provide any information the disclosure of which is prohibited
or restricted under applicable Law or is Privileged Information, or (iv) take
any action that will conflict with or violate its Organizational Documents or
any applicable Laws or would result in a violation or breach of, or default
under, any Contract to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
(other than any Section 5.09 Business Guarantee which is otherwise being
amended or waived in a manner otherwise in compliance with this _Section_ __
_ 5.09_).

(f) Any Business Guarantee provided by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than the Transferred Entities or the JV Entities) after the date hereof
through Closing will be treated in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.09_
and as such be treated as a "Section 5.09 Business Guarantee."

Section 5.10. _Use of Seller Marks_.

 

(a) Buyer agrees that, except as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_,
Buyer and its Subsidiaries have, and after the Closing, the Transferred
Entities will have, no right, title, interest, license or any other right
whatsoever in the Seller Marks, and that none of Seller or any of its
respective Affiliates have assigned such right, title, interest, license or
other right to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including following the
Closing, the Transferred Entities and the JV Entities).

 



68|

    

(b) Immediately following the Closing, Buyer and the Transferred Entities
shall cease and discontinue any use of marketing and promotional materials,
invoices, business cards, schedules, stationery, technical guidelines, product
manuals, packing materials and other supplies and similar materials, that
were previously created and included in the inventory of the Business and
that incorporate the Seller Marks and shall, at Buyers sole cost and expense,
remove all Seller Marks from all such supplies and materials, in each case,
whether such supplies or materials are held by Buyer, a Buyer Designee, the
Transferred Entities or the JV Entities or under the control of Buyer, a Buyer
Designee, a Transferred Entity or a JV Entity.

 

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Closing but in no event later than
two (2) months after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Transferred
Entities to, at Buyers sole cost and expense, change their names to remove
the word "Jacobs" or any other Seller Mark or any derivations or translation
thereof, including filings with the applicable Governmental Authority of each
jurisdiction in which the ownership or the operation of the Business or the
character of its activities is such as to require it to be licensed or
qualified in such jurisdiction, and providing notice to all
customers, vendors and other suppliers of such name change. As promptly as
practicable after the Closing but in no event later than six (6) months after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Transferred Entities and the JV
Entities to, at Buyers sole cost and expense, remove or obliterate all
Seller Marks from any signs or displays and cease any other use of the Seller
Marks. Immediately upon the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities and the JV Entities) to
cease holding themselves out as having any affiliation with Seller or its
Subsidiaries in respect of the Business.

 

(d) At Closing, Buyer will host a webpage for a period of twelve (12)
months that (i) indicates that, as of the Closing Date, the Business is no
longer owned by Seller; and (ii) redirects the user to Sellers website. The
Parties shall consult with, and consider in good faith any comments of, the
other Party with respect to such webpage copy, subject to Sellers approval
which is not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

Section 5.11. _Transferred Trademarks_.

 

(a) Seller agrees that, other than the rights granted in _Section_ __ _
5.11(c)_, after the Closing, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
have any right, title, interest, license or any other right whatsoever in the
Transferred Trademarks.

 

(b) Immediately following the Closing, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall
cease and discontinue any use of marketing and promotional materials,
invoices, business cards, schedules, stationery, technical guidelines, product
manuals, packing materials and other supplies and similar materials, that
incorporate the Transferred Trademarks and shall, at Sellers sole cost and
expense, remove all Transferred Trademarks from all such supplies and
materials.

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Closing but in no event later
than two (2) months after the Closing Date, Seller shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, at Sellers sole cost and expense, change its name, to the
extent applicable, to remove the word Comprimo or Chemetics or any other
Transferred Trademark or any derivations or translation thereof, including
filings with the applicable Governmental Authority of each jurisdiction in
which the ownership or the operation of any applicable Subsidiary of Seller
or the character of its activities is such as to require it to be licensed or
qualified in such jurisdiction, and providing notice to all customers, vendors
and other suppliers of such name change. As promptly as practicable after the
Closing but in no event later than six (6) months after the Closing Date,
Seller shall,

 



69|

    

 and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at Sellers sole cost and expense,
remove or obliterate all Transferred Trademarks from any signs or displays and
cease any other use of the Transferred Trademarks. Immediately upon the
Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to cease holding
themselves out as having any affiliation with Comprimo or Chemetics.

 

(d) At Closing, Seller will host a webpage for a period of twelve (12)
months that (i) indicates that, as of the Closing Date, the Business is owned
by Buyer; and (ii) redirects the user to Buyers website. The Parties shall
consult with, and consider in good faith any comments of, the other Party with
respect to such webpage copy, subject to Buyers approval which is not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

Section 5.12. _Insurance_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
(including the Transferred Entities and the JV Entities (as limited by
Sellers express rights to exercise control over such JV Entities)) to,
continue to carry their existing insurance policies with respect to the
Business and shall not allow any material breach, default or
cancellation (other than expiration and replacement of policies in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice) of such insurance
policies to occur or exist.

 

(b) It is the intent of the Parties that claims for insurance coverage with
respect to the Assumed Liabilities under insurance policies of Seller and its
Subsidiaries written on a "claims made" basis (the " _Claims Made Policies_
"), which are reported to a third party insurer under such policies prior to
the Closing, shall be transferred to Buyer at the Closing (i) to the extent
of coverage under the applicable Claims Made Policies, (ii) pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the applicable Claims Made Policies, and (iii) except
as otherwise provided by this  _Section_ __ _ 5.12_. It is further the
intent of the Parties that claims for insurance coverage with respect to the
Assumed Liabilities under insurance policies of Seller and its Subsidiaries
written on an "occurrence" basis (the " _Occurrence Policies_ ", and together
with the Claims Made Policies, the " _Liability Policies_ "), which are
reported to a third party insurer under such policies prior to or after the
Closing, shall be transferred to Buyer at or after the Closing, as
applicable, (x) to the extent of coverage under the applicable Occurrence
Policies, (y) pursuant to the terms and conditions of the applicable
Occurrence Policies, and (z) except as otherwise provided by this _Section_
__ _ 5.12_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that from and
after the Closing, Seller shall have sole and exclusive authority to pursue
and settle such claims for insurance related to such transferred claims under
Claims Made Policies or Occurrence Policies (the " _Transferred Coverage_ ")
and, at the request and direction of Buyer or its applicable Subsidiary,
Seller shall pursue and settle claims for the Transferred Coverage and remit
to Buyer any payments received from insurers with respect to the Transferred
Coverage; _provided_ , that (A) Seller and its Subsidiaries may, at any time,
without Liability or obligation to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, amend,
commute, terminate, extinguish liability under or otherwise modify any of its
insurance policies (including any Liability Policies) _provided_ , that such
amendment or termination is not done for the purpose of negating Buyers
benefit under this _clause (b)_ , (B) any such insurance claim, and Buyers or
its applicable Subsidiaries potential recovery with respect thereto, will be
subject to, and Sellers assistance in respect thereof shall be limited by,
all of the terms and conditions of the applicable Liability Policy (including
any coverage limits with respect thereto), (C) Buyer and its Subsidiaries
shall pay any deductible, self-insurance retention or other cost with respect
to the applicable Liability Policy when due or reasonably requested by Seller,
(D) Seller shall have no obligation under this _clause (b)_ with respect to,
and Buyer shall have no rights to coverage under, any fronting policy, policy
issued by a captive insurance carrier or any arrangement under which Seller is
obligated to reimburse or indemnify the insurer, and (E) Seller shall engage
counsel selected by Buyer and shall be entitled to be reimbursed by Buyer for
all reasonable costs, expenses and fees (including attorneys fees) incurred
by Seller in the defense of such matter to the extent not covered by the
Liability Policy; _provided_ , that Seller shall not settle, adjust or
compromise any such claim without the prior written consent of Buyer (such
consent not to be unreasonably

 withheld, conditioned or delayed), (G) Buyer shall not settle, adjust or
compromise any such claim without the prior written consent of Seller (such
consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), and (H)
"Transferred Coverage" shall not include any claims for insurance coverage
under Liability Policies where the governing law would require insurer consent
for such transfer and, absent such consent, the transfer would constitute a
breach of the insurance policy.

(c) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing (as extended by
any additional closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.09_) and the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as soon as possible all insurance
required pursuant to the terms of any Contract, Law or Permit applicable to
the ownership or operation of the Business, the Transferred Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities.

 

Section 5.13. _Legal Actions; Production of Witnesses; Privileged
Matters_. 

(a) Following the Closing, as between the Parties and each of their
Subsidiaries (i) Buyer shall have exclusive authority and control over the
investigation, prosecution, defense and appeal of all Actions arising solely
from or primarily relating to the Business (other than to the extent related
to any Retained Asset or Retained Liability), the Assumed Liabilities, the
Transferred Assets, the Transferred Entities or the JV Entities, and may
settle or compromise, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to
any such Action, without the consent of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries,
except that Buyer shall not settle or compromise, or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to any Action, without the written consent of
Seller, where such settlement, compromise or judgment admits, acknowledges or
concedes Liability, fault or responsibility on the part of Seller, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives or would impose
injunctive or other equitable relief or any financial obligations that will
not be indemnified subject to Section 5.20 on Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries and (ii) Seller shall have exclusive authority and control over
the investigation, prosecution, defense and appeal of all Actions arising
solely from, or primarily relating to the Retained Liabilities, the Retained
Assets or the Retained Businesses, and may settle or compromise, or consent to
the entry of any judgment with respect to any such Action without the consent
of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, except that Seller shall not settle or
compromise, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any
Action, without the written consent of Buyer, where such settlement,
compromise or judgment admits, acknowledges or concedes Liability, fault or
responsibility on the part of Buyer, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives or would impose injunctive or other equitable
relief or any financial obligations that will not be indemnified subject to
Section 5.20 on Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller or Buyer have the right to defend themselves in any such
Action if (i) the other Party fails or refuses to diligently defend such
Action, or (ii) such Action involves a Government Authority acting in a
criminal, regulatory, or administrative capacity. Notwithstanding anything in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.13(a)_, the Parties may also seek indemnification
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.28_.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand, shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to make available to each other, upon
reasonable written request, their (and their Subsidiaries) respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and other Representatives for fact
finding, consultation and interviews and as witnesses to the extent that any
such Person may reasonably be required in connection with any Actions in which
the requesting Party may from time to time be involved relating to the conduct
of the Business or the Retained Businesses, prior to or after the Closing.
Access to such Persons shall be granted during normal business hours at a
location and in a manner reasonably calculated to minimize disruption to such
Persons, the Business and the Retained Businesses, as applicable. Each Party
agrees to reimburse each other for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses,
including attorneys fees, but excluding officers or employees salaries,
incurred by the other Party in connection with providing individuals and
witnesses pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.13(b)_.

 



71|

    

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of _ARTICLE VI_ shall
govern with respect to Tax-related matters to the extent any provision in
_ARTICLE VI_ is in conflict with this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_. For the avoidance
of doubt, neither Party shall have an obligation to cooperate, make available
personnel or disclose any documents or other information pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 5.13(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.13(b)_ or _ARTICLE VI_ , if Seller or any
of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the
other hand, are adverse parties in any Action and such assistance, testimony,
documents or other information is reasonably pertinent thereto; _provided_ ,
_ _ _further_ , that this shall not limit in any respect any rights a Party
may have with respect to discovery or the production of documents or other
information in connection with any such Action.

 

(d) The Parties agree that their respective rights and obligations to
maintain, preserve, assert or waive any attorney-client, business strategy,
joint defense, common interest, and/or work product privileges belonging to
either Party with respect to the Business and the Retained Businesses
(collectively, " _Privileges_ ") following the Closing, shall be governed by
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.13(d)_. With respect to matters
relating to the Reorganization, the Retained Liabilities, the Retained Assets
or the Retained Businesses, and with respect to all Business Records,
documents, communications or other information (collectively, " _Information_
") of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries prepared in connection with the
drafting, negotiation or execution of this Agreement, the Transaction
Documents, the Reorganization Documents or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, Seller shall have sole authority to determine whether to
assert or waive any Privileges, including the right to assert any Privilege
against Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (" _Seller Controlled
Privileges_ "). Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including, as of the Closing, the
Transferred Entities and the JV Entities) shall take no action without the
prior written consent of Seller that would reasonably be expected to result
in any waiver of any Seller Controlled Privileges. After the Closing, Buyer
shall have sole authority to determine whether to assert or waive any
Privileges with respect to matters solely relating to the Business (except
for the Retained Assets, the Retained Liabilities, Information prepared in
connection with this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the Reorganization
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and the Seller
Controlled Privileges) (" _Buyer Controlled Privileges_ "); _provided_ , that
Buyer may not assert any such Privileges of Buyer related to pre-Closing
Information relating to the Business against Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives. Seller and its Subsidiaries shall take no
action after the Closing without the prior written consent of Buyer that would
reasonably be expected to result in any waiver of any such Privileges of
Buyer. The rights and obligations created by this _Section_ __ _ 5.13(d)_
shall apply to all Information as to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Transferred Entities and the JV Entities) would be entitled to
assert or has asserted a Privilege without regard to the effect, if any, of
the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Privileged Information_ ").

 

(e) Upon receipt by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, or Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries (including, as of the Closing, the Transferred Entities and
the JV Entities), as the case may be, of any subpoena, discovery or other
request from any Person that actually or arguably calls for the production or
disclosure of Privileged Information of the other Party or if Seller or its
Subsidiaries or Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including, as of the Closing, the
Transferred Entities and the JV Entities), as the case may be, obtains
knowledge that any current or former employee of Seller or of its Subsidiaries
or Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including, as of the Closing, the
Transferred Entities and the JV Entities), has received any subpoena,
discovery or other request from any Person that actually or arguably calls for
the production or disclosure of Privileged Information of one or more of the
other Parties, Seller or Buyer, as applicable, shall promptly notify the other
Party of the existence of the request and shall provide such other Party a
reasonable opportunity to review the subpoena, discovery or other request and
to assert any rights it may have under this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ or otherwise
to prevent the production or disclosure of Privileged Information. Sellers
transfer of any Information to Buyer or a Buyer Designee in accordance with
this Agreement and Sellers agreement to permit Buyer or a Buyer Designee to
obtain Information existing prior to the Closing are made in reliance on the
Parties respective agreements, as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_
and _Section_ __ _ 5.15_,

 



72|

    

 to maintain the confidentiality of such Information and to take the steps
provided herein for the preservation of all Privileges that may belong to or
be asserted by Seller or Buyer, as the case may be. The access to Information
being granted pursuant to this Agreement, the agreement to provide witnesses
and individuals pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ and the disclosure to
the Parties of Privileged Information, if any, relating to the Business or
the Retained Businesses pursuant to this Agreement in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby shall not be asserted by Seller or Buyer to
constitute, or otherwise deemed, a waiver of any Privilege that has been or
may be asserted under this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ or otherwise.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ to the
contrary, all rights and obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_
are qualified by the limits of Buyers and its Subsidiaries rights to
exercise control over each JV Entity following the Closing.

Section 5.14. _Retention of Business Records and Post-Closing Access_.

(a) After the Closing, Buyer agrees to, or shall cause one or more of its
Subsidiaries to, hold at least one copy of all of the Transferred Books and
Records and all other Business Records relating to the conduct of the
Business, the Transferred Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Transferred
Entities or the JV Entities on or before the Closing Date in their respective
possession and not to destroy or dispose of such copy for a period of seven
(7) years from the Closing Date or such longer time as may be required by
applicable Law or Order, and if thereafter Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
proposes to destroy or dispose of such copy, Buyer shall offer first in
writing at least thirty (30) days prior to such proposed destruction or
disposition to surrender all or any portion of such Transferred Books and
Records or Business Records to Seller. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.15_,
Seller and its Subsidiaries may retain a copy of any or all of the Transferred
Books and Records and the Business Records and any other materials included
in any electronic data room or that are otherwise in the possession or under
the control of Seller or its Subsidiaries relating to the conduct of the
Business, the Transferred Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the
Transferred Entities or the JV Entities on or before the Closing Date.

(b) From and after the Closing, subject to  _Section_ __ _ 5.15_, Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Transferred Entities
and the JV Entities, to (i) give Seller and its Representatives reasonable
access to the offices, properties and Business Records of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries, including the Transferred Entities and the JV Entities, relating
to the conduct of the Business, the Transferred Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities, the Transferred Entities and the JV Entities on or before
the Closing Date, and (ii) cause the employees, counsel, auditors and other
Representatives of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, including the Transferred
Entities and the JV Entities, to cooperate with Seller and its
Representatives, in each case, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable prior notice to the extent reasonably requested by Seller (A) to
comply with reporting, disclosure, filing or other requirements imposed on
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (including under applicable securities
Laws) by any Governmental Authority, (B) to carry out its human resources
functions or to establish, assume or administer its Employee Plans or payroll
functions, (C) to prepare its financial statements or Tax Returns, or in
order to satisfy audit, accounting or other similar requirements, (D) to
defend any Action (excluding any Action against Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries), or (E) in connection with similar legitimate business
needs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such access shall be granted upon
reasonable advance notice, during normal business hours and in a manner as not
to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries. All rights and obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _
5.14(b)_ are qualified by the limits of Buyers and its Subsidiaries rights
to exercise control over each JV Entity following the Closing.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts, to cooperate with Sellers reasonable
information requests to enable (i) Seller to meet its timetable for
dissemination of its earnings releases, financial statements and managements
assessment

 



73|

    

 of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and its
internal control over financial reporting, and (ii) Sellers accountants to
timely complete their review of the quarterly financial statements and audit
of the annual financial statements, including, to the extent applicable to
Seller, its auditors audit of its internal control over financial reporting
and managements assessment thereof.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may withhold any access required
by this  _Section_ __ _ 5.14_, to the extent necessary to avoid the
violation of Law to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is subject or the
waiver of any Privilege; _provided_ , that to the extent practicable and in
accordance with such Law, and in a manner that does not result in the waiver
of any such Privilege, Buyer shall make reasonable and appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which these restrictions apply;
_provided_ , _ _ _further_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ shall
limit in any respect any rights any Party may have with respect to discovery
or the production of documents or other information in connection with any
litigation. 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of _ARTICLE VI_ shall
govern with respect to Tax-related matters to the extent any provision in
_ARTICLE VI_ is in conflict with _Section_ __ _ 5.13(a)_ or _Section_ __ _
5.13(b)_.

 

Section 5.15. _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect until the Closing and that any Business
Records, data and other information provided to Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives between the date hereof and the Closing shall
be considered Evaluation Material (as such term is defined in
the Confidentiality Agreement) and afforded all protections provided therein.
Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall terminate.

 

(b) Seller shall not, and shall cause its Representatives and Subsidiaries
not to, directly or indirectly, for a period of three (3) years after the
Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Buyer (such consent to not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), disclose to any third party
(other than each other and their respective Representatives) or use in any
manner (other than for the express purposes set forth in the Transaction
Documents or the Reorganization Documents or any other agreement contemplated
hereby or thereby, including _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ hereof) any confidential
or proprietary Information primarily related to the Business (other than in
respect of Retained Assets or Retained Liabilities) or related to Buyer or its
business; _provided_ , that the foregoing restriction shall not (i) apply to
any Information (A) generally available to, or known by, the public (other
than as a result of disclosure in violation of this _Section_ __ _ 5.15(b)_),
or (B) independently developed by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives (other than by the Transferred Entities and the JV Entities)
without reference to or use of the applicable confidential or proprietary
Information (other than Information relating to the Retained Business,
any Retained Liabilities or any Retained Assets), or (ii) prohibit any use or
disclosure (A) requested or required by Law or any Governmental Authority
process so long as, to the extent legally permissible and reasonably
practicable, Seller provides Buyer with reasonable prior notice of such
disclosure and a reasonable opportunity to contest such disclosure, (B) to
comply with reporting, disclosure, filing or other requirements imposed on
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (including under applicable securities
Laws) by any Governmental Authority, (C) made in connection with the
enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this Agreement or any of the
other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, or (D) reasonably required to operate the Retained Business in the
ordinary course. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
_Section 5.15(b)_ , Seller and its Subsidiaries and Representatives shall
be deemed to have satisfied their nondisclosure obligations hereunder with
respect to confidential or proprietary Information primarily related to the
Business (other than in respect to Retained Assets or Retained Liabilities) or
related to Buyer or its business if they exercise the same degree of care

 



74|

    

 (but no less than a reasonable degree of care) as they take to preserve
confidentiality for their own similar Information. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, nothing herein shall prevent Seller or its
Subsidiaries from disclosing or using Information (i) used or held for use in
any Retained Business or (ii) to the extent relating to any Retained Asset or
Retained Liability.

 

(c) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Representatives and Subsidiaries
not to, directly or indirectly, for a period of three (3) years after the
Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Seller, disclose to any
third party (other than each other and their respective Representatives) or
use in any manner (other than for the express purposes set forth in the
Transaction Documents or the Reorganization Documents or any other agreement
contemplated hereby or thereby, including _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ hereof) any
confidential or proprietary Information primarily related to the Retained
Businesses, the Retained Assets or the Retained Liabilities; _provided_ , that
the foregoing restriction shall not (i) apply to any Information (A) generally
available to, or known by, the public (other than as a result of disclosure
in violation of this _Section_ __ _ 5.15(c)_) or (B) independently developed
by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives (other than by the
Transferred Entities or the JV Entities prior to the Closing) without
reference to or use of the applicable confidential or proprietary Information,
or (ii) prohibit any use or disclosure (A) requested or required by Law or any
Governmental Authority process so long as, to the extent legally permissible
and reasonably practicable, Buyer provides Seller with reasonable prior notice
of such disclosure and a reasonable opportunity to contest such disclosure,
(B) to comply with reporting, disclosure, filing or other
requirements imposed on Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including under
applicable securities Laws) by any Governmental Authority, (C) made in
connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, or (D) reasonably required to operate the
Business in the ordinary course. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.15(c)_, Buyer and its Subsidiaries and
Representatives shall be deemed to have satisfied their nondisclosure
obligations hereunder with respect to confidential or proprietary Information
primarily related to the Retained Businesses, the Retained Assets and the
Retained Liabilities if they exercise the same degree of care (but no less
than a reasonable degree of care) as they take to preserve confidentiality for
their own similar Information.

 

Section 5.16. _Noncompetition;  Non-Solicitation_.

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the
five (5) year anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Restricted Period_ "),
Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, provide ECR
Services to ECR Clients for ECR Projects (a " _Competing Activity_ ");
_provided_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be precluded or otherwise restricted from:

 

(i) providing ECR Services on ECR Projects as necessary to (A) avoid breach
of any Contract to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of
the Closing, or (B) transition personnel of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
to non-ECR Projects, in each case, for up to one (1) year following the
Closing Date or for such longer periods as may permitted by the Transition
Services Agreement;

(ii) providing ECR Services using its Retained Assets (such as the
Specialized Manufacturing Business) or as may be expressly permitted pursuant
to any Transaction Document;

 

(iii) subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.16(b)_ and  _Section_
__ _ 5.16(c)_, __ acquiring (whether by merger, consolidation, acquisition of
stock or assets, license or otherwise) all or any portion of any Person
(whether or not such Person is engaged in any Competing Activity, a " _Seller
Acquisition_ ") and continuing to operate such Person in the ordinary course;

 



75|

    

(iv) de minimis ECR Services for ECR Projects; or

 

(v) providing non-ECR Services (whether to ECR Clients or otherwise)
or participating in or working on non-ECR Projects (including, but not
limited to, buildings, civil works, water projects, environmental projects,
utility projects and data center projects).

 

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, in the event (i) Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries undertakes a Seller Acquisition during the Restricted Period,
and (ii) the Person, assets or business acquired pursuant thereto generated
Competing Acquisition Revenues between $100,000,000 and $400,000,000, then
within ninety (90) days following the closing of such Seller Acquisition,
Seller shall deliver to Buyer a written offer to sell to Buyer the portion of
such Person, assets or business engaged primarily in a Competing Activity at
the same multiple of earnings paid (increased by the cash tax liability
of Seller and its Subsidiaries resulting from such sale and any associated
payment by Buyer to Seller), and on the same terms agreed, by Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries therefor (in each case as reflected in the definitive
documentation signed by the parties to effect such Seller Acquisition,
excluding for the avoidance of doubt any restrictive covenants or similar
terms personal to the seller of such Person, assets or business). Seller shall
include with such offer copies of the definitive documentation signed by the
parties to effect such Seller Acquisition sufficient to permit Buyer to
confirm the price (including multiple of earnings) and other terms set forth
in Sellers offer. Such offer shall remain open for a period of sixty (60)
days from Buyers receipt thereof. If Buyer fails to accept such offer and
execute definitive documentation consistent therewith, within such sixty (60)
day period, then, subject to the terms of  _Section_ __ _ 5.16(c) _Seller or
its applicable Subsidiaries shall be entitled to retain and operate such
Person, assets or business in its sole discretion and any such retention or
operation shall not be deemed to violate, or be taken into account in
assessing any breach of, this _Section_ __ _ 5.16_.

(c) Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 5.16(b)_, in the event (i) Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries undertakes a Seller Acquisition during the Restricted
Period, and (ii) the Person, assets or business acquired pursuant thereto
either (A) generated Competing Acquisition Revenues which represented more
than 20% of its aggregate revenues for the same prior year fiscal period or
(B) generated Competing Acquisition Revenues in excess of $400,000,000 (either
alone or when combined with the Competing Acquisition Revenues applicable to
the portion of any prior Seller Acquisition retained by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries as of such time), then (1) Seller shall, promptly after the
closing of such Seller Acquisition, notify Buyer in writing that the
threshold set forth in clause (A) or (B) has been exceeded, and (2) within a
reasonable period of time following the closing of such Seller Acquisition
(but in any event within eighteen (18) months of the closing of such Seller
Acquisition), Seller and its Subsidiaries shall divest the portion of such
acquired Person, assets or business engaged primarily in a Competing Activity
(a " _Threshold ECR Business_ "). In connection with Sellers process to
undertake such divestiture, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing
(provided that Seller shall have no obligation to notify Buyer in advance of
notice to any other potential buyer) of such divestiture process and allow
Buyer the same time to review the potential transaction and to make a proposal
to acquire the Threshold ECR Business as other bidders in the process in
connection therewith. The Parties acknowledge and agree that Seller and
its Subsidiaries shall have the right, in their sole discretion, to reject
any and all proposals made by Buyer or any of Buyers Subsidiaries with regard
to any such divestiture, and to terminate discussions and negotiations with
Buyer at any time. The Parties also agree that (I) Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall be free to conduct any process with respect to such
divestiture as Seller and its Subsidiaries in their sole discretion shall
determine (including, without limitation, by negotiating with any prospective
party and entering into a definitive written agreement without prior notice to
Buyer, its Subsidiaries or any other Person other than the initial notice of
the process required by this  _Section_ __ _ 5.16(c)_), (II) any procedures
relating to such divestiture (other than those specified in this _Section_ __
_ 5.16(c)_) may be changed at any time without notice to Buyer, its
Subsidiaries or any other Person, and (III) neither Buyer nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall have any claim whatsoever against Seller, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, arising out of or
relating to any such 

 



76|

    

 divestiture (other than with respect to the express obligations set forth
herein and pursuant to a written, definitive, executed and binding agreement,
if any, executed by the Parties in connection with such divestiture).

(d) " _Competing Acquisition Revenues_ " means revenues generated from a
Competing Activity by the acquired Person, assets or business during its
annual fiscal period immediately preceding the closing of the applicable
Seller Acquisition. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) all revenues generated
from a Competing Activity shall be calculated at the time of the applicable
Seller Acquisition and in respect of the annual fiscal period applicable to
the acquired Person, assets or business immediately preceding the closing of
such Seller Acquisition as otherwise stated in this Agreement, and (ii) no
revenues or activities following the closing of such Seller Acquisition will
be taken into account for purposes of determining the thresholds set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 5.16(b)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 5.16(c)_.

the five (5) year anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause Jacobs

government buildings, hospitals and research facilities, mission critical and
data centers, educational institutions/schools, airports, hub cities, sports,
leisure entertainment and public gathering venues, and their support
facilities that are used as a place for people to live, work, and engage
in recreational, entertainment, or other activities) or (ii) the permanent
improvement to real property (including roads, bridges, tunnels, water

S.A. shall not be precluded or otherwise restricted from engaging in JESA
Competing Activities in any country in which it engaged in a JESA Competing
Activity as of the Closing or during the twelve (12) month period immediately
prior to the Closing.

(f) For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date, Seller
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly,

employment to, any key executive or key management personnel of Buyer, in
each case set forth on _Section_ __ _ 5.16(f)_ of the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule (collectively, the " _Buyer Key Employees_ "); _provided,_ that
nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.16(f)_ shall restrict or preclude Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries from making general solicitations (including
advertisements) of any form or by engaging search firms that are not
specifically instructed or directed by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to
solicit Buyer Key Employees.

(g) For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date, Seller

_Section_ __ _ 5.16(g)_) shall restrict or preclude Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries from (A) making general solicitations (including advertisements)

part of the relevant amendment, modification, waiver or replacement there is a
corresponding increase in the Equity Financing, or (II) would reasonably be
expected to (x) materially delay or prevent the Closing, or (y) in such a way

conditions to obtaining the Financing) less likely to occur. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Buyer may modify, restate, supplement, amend or amend and
restate the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents, co-agents, other agents or similar entities

status of its efforts to arrange the Financing. Buyer shall give Seller prompt
notice of any actual or threatened breach or repudiation by any Party to the

79|

    

(ii) cause the Businesss management team, with appropriate seniority and

potential providers of the Debt Financing and rating agencies;

(iii) (A) assist with the preparation of customary rating agency

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and the Business shall in no event be
required to (i) provide any assistance that shall unreasonably interfere with
its business operations, (ii) waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or
agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the Closing Date for

and other Representatives, whether such information can be provided using

capitalization,

 



80|

    

 ownership, or other pro forma adjustments and any financial projections of
Buyer or the assets, Equity Interests and properties being acquired hereunder.
Nothing in this Agreement will require (A) any Representative of Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries to take any action that could reasonably be expected
to result in personal Liability to such Representative, or (B) the members of
the board of directors (or other governing body) of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof to approve any financing or Contracts
related thereto.

 

(b) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Subsidiaries,
and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and other
Representatives from and against any and all Liabilities suffered or incurred
in connection with the Financing or any assistance or activities provided in
connection therewith. Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller and its

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is understood and
agreed that the condition precedent set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)_, as
applied to Sellers obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.19_, shall be
deemed to be satisfied unless the Financing has not been obtained as a direct
result of Sellers willful and material breach of its obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.19_. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that obtaining the
Financing is not a condition to Closing. None of Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall have any obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.19_
following the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(d) All non-public or other confidential information provided by Seller or
any of its Representatives pursuant to this Agreement will be kept

or prospective financing sources and other financial institutions and
investors that are or may become parties to the Debt Financing and to any
underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents in connection with the
Equity Financing (and, in each case, to their respective counsel and
auditors) so long as such persons (i) agree to be bound by the Confidentiality
Agreement as if parties thereto, or (ii) are subject to other confidentiality
undertakings reasonably satisfactory to Seller and of which Seller is a
beneficiary.

(e) Subject to Buyers indemnification obligations under  _Section_ __ _
5.19(b)_, Seller hereby consents to the reasonable use of the Businesss logos
solely in connection with the Debt Financing; provided, however, that such

respective marks.

Transferred Entities or the JV Entities as set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.20(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be made by independent

5.20_.

(e) Buyer hereby acknowledges that one or more DandO Indemnitees may have

Buyer hereby agrees that (i) it and the Transferred Entities and JV Entities
are the indemnitor of first resort with respect to Actions and Liabilities
covered by the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 5.20_ (i.e., its obligations to
such DandO Indemnitee are primary and any obligation of the Seller Indemnitors
to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or
Liabilities incurred by such DandO Indemnitee are secondary), (ii) it and the
Transferred Entities and the JV Entities shall be required to advance the
full amount of expenses incurred by such DandO Indemnitee and shall be liable
for the full amount of all Liabilities paid in settlement to the extent
legally permitted and as required by the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 5.20_,
without regard to any rights such DandO Indemnitee may have against the Seller
Indemnitors, and (iii)

 



82|

    

 it and the Transferred Entities and the JV Entities irrevocably waive,
relinquish and release the Seller Indemnitors from any and all claims against
the Seller Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of
any kind in respect thereof. Buyer further agrees that no advancement or
payment by the Seller Indemnitors on behalf of such DandO Indemnitee with
respect to any claim for which such DandO Indemnitee has sought indemnification
from Buyer, the Transferred Entities and/or the JV Entities shall affect the
foregoing and the Seller Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and/or
to be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the
rights of recovery of such DandO Indemnitee against Buyer, the Transferred
Entities and the JV Entities. Buyer and each DandO Indemnitee agree that the
Seller Indemnitors are express third-party beneficiaries of the terms of
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.20(e)_.

(f) The obligations of Buyer under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.20_ shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO
Indemnitee to whom this _Section_ __ _ 5.20_ applies without the consent of
the affected DandO Indemnitee. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.20_ (i)
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO
Indemnitee and such DandO Indemnitees heirs and Representatives, and (ii)
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Contract, at
Law or otherwise.

to exclusions from coverage thereunder or the failure of the RandW Policy to be
in full force and effect for any reason, shall not expand, alter, amend,
change or otherwise affect Sellers or its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives or any of their respective successors and
assigns Liability under this Agreement.

Team Leads) to discuss _Exhibit A-1_ and the Transition Services Agreement
Term Sheet. Promptly after the date of this Agreement, Seller and Buyer

both _Exhibit A-1_ and Transition Services Agreement, whereupon the Parties
shall amend this Agreement to incorporate these documents. Either Party may
replace its Separation Team Lead by providing written notice to the other
Party designating its new Separation Team Lead (but in any event, each Party
must at all times prior to Closing have a designated Separation Team Lead). In
the event of any dispute or disagreement between Seller and Buyer as to
_Exhibit A-1_ or the implementation thereof, the dispute, on written request
of either Party, shall be referred to representatives of the Parties
for decision, each Party being represented by a senior executive officer (the

ARTICLE VI

 

TAX MATTERS

 Section 6.01. _Tax Returns; Refunds; Transfer Taxes_.

(a) Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all Seller Group Tax Returns for all taxable periods. If a
Transferred Entity or JV Entity is permitted under applicable Law to treat the
Closing Date as the last day of a Tax period in which the Closing occurs,
Seller and Buyer shall treat (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to
treat) the Closing Date as the last day of such Tax period with respect to
such Transferred Entity or JV Entity. Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or
cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by
the Transferred Entities or the JV Entities (i) for all Straddle Tax Periods
and (ii) for Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date and required to
be filed after the Closing Date (each such non-Seller Group Tax Return, a "
_Buyer-Filed Tax Return_ "), and for the avoidance of doubt, a Buyer-Filed Tax
Return does not include any Seller Group Tax Returns. Any Buyer-Filed Tax
Return (A) shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice (unless
otherwise required by applicable Law), (B) shall reflect a deduction for
Sellers fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Reorganization to the

 



88|

    

 maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, and to the extent that any
Buyer-Filed Tax Return shows a net operating loss, such net operating loss
shall be carried back to previous Tax periods of the Transferred Entities or
the JV Entities to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, and (C)
shall be submitted by Buyer to Seller (together with schedules, statements
and, to the extent reasonably requested by Seller, supporting documentation)
for Sellers review and comment at least thirty (30) days (or in the case of a
Tax Return not related to Income Taxes, seven (7) days) prior to the due date
(including any applicable extension) for filing such Tax Return. Buyer shall
incorporate Sellers reasonable comments to any Buyer-Filed Tax Return that
are provided in writing to Buyer by Seller at least seven (7) days (or in the
case of a Tax Return not related to Income Taxes, four (4) days) prior to the
due date (including any applicable extension) for filing such Tax Return.
Without prejudice to Sellers indemnity obligations pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.06(a)_ and payment obligations to Buyer pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.01(a)_, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes with respect to any
Buyer-Filed Tax Return in accordance with Law. Except to the extent otherwise
required pursuant to applicable Law or in connection with the final
resolution of a Tax Claim governed by _Section_ __ _ 6.07_, neither Buyer nor
any Transferred Entity or JV Entity shall amend any Tax Return for any Tax
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or a Straddle Tax Period
without the prior written consent of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. By the later of (i) five (5) days after
Seller receives from Buyer an invoice requesting payment of Taxes
with respect to a Buyer-Filed Tax Return, and (ii) seven (7) days (or in the
case of non-Income Taxes, four (4) days) prior to the latest date on which
such Taxes are due and payable without interest or penalties, Seller shall
pay to Buyer the amount of such Taxes (except to the extent such Taxes were
taken into account as a current liability in the Final Net Working Capital)
attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, calculated in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 6.06(c)_ for a Straddle Tax Period.

 

(b) Seller shall be entitled to any refunds of Taxes (or any credits
against cash Taxes actually payable received in lieu of such refund) of any
Transferred Entity or JV Entity relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period that
are received after the Closing by Buyer, any Transferred Entity or any JV
Entity, plus any interest actually received with respect thereto from an
applicable Taxing Authority (collectively, " _Tax Refunds_ "), except to the
extent any such Tax Refund (i) was included as a current asset in the Final
Net Working Capital, (ii) results from the carryback of any net operating
loss, credit, or other Tax attribute from any Post-Closing Tax Period that is
permitted by _Section_ __ _ 6.01(c)_, or (iii) relates to Seller Taxes that
are paid by any Buyer Indemnified Parties after the Closing and that have not
been indemnified by Seller pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer shall pay, or
cause to be paid, any such Tax Refunds to Seller no later than ten (10) days
following receipt of such Tax Refund, net of any out-of- pocket expenses
incurred in connection with obtaining such Tax Refund (including any Taxes
imposed thereon).

 

(c) Upon Sellers request and at Sellers expense, Buyer shall, or shall
cause the relevant Transferred Entity or JV Entity to, initiate a claim for a
Tax Refund. Without Sellers prior written consent, or except to the extent
otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law, Buyer shall not cause or permit
any Transferred Entity or JV Entity to carry back any net operating loss or
other Tax attribute from any Tax period beginning after the Closing Date to
any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

Section 6.02. _Transfer Taxes: VAT_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all excise,
sales, use, registration stamp, recording, documentary, conveyancing,
franchise, property, transfer, gains and similar Taxes (collectively, "
_Transfer Taxes_ ") arising from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be borne by the Party legally required to pay such amount
under applicable Tax Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Transfer Taxes
arising from the Reorganization shall be borne entirely by Seller, and upon
request and presentation of reasonable documentation to Buyer, Buyer will
reimburse Seller for up to $5 million of the Transfer Taxes arising from the
Reorganization.

 



89|

    

(b) All amounts due under, and consideration given in respect of
the subject matter of, this Agreement from or by Buyer are exclusive of VAT.
If any VAT is chargeable in respect of any supply made by Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller to Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer, Buyer shall on demand
pay or reimburse (or procure that the relevant Affiliate of Buyer shall pay
or reimburse) such VAT in addition to the amounts or consideration otherwise
due or payable, at the rate in force at the due time of the relevant supply or
such other time as is stipulated under the relevant legislation. The Seller
shall (and shall procure that each relevant Affiliate of Seller shall)
promptly provide to Buyer or relevant Affiliate of Buyer a valid VAT invoice
in respect of any such VAT. Each of Seller and Buyer shall use (and procure
that their respective Affiliates shall use) commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize (to the extent permissible at Law) obligations relating to VAT as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 6.03. _Cooperation On Tax Matters_. __ The Parties shall,
and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate fully, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other, in connection with the
preparation, execution and filing of Tax Returns of or with respect to the
Business, the Transferred Assets, any Transferred Entity or any JV Entity and
any audit, Taxing Authority inquiry, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes of or with respect to the Business, the Transferred Assets,
any Transferred Entity or any JV Entity. Such cooperation shall include
access to records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such
Tax Return or audit, litigation or other proceeding, making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder and executing
powers of attorney. The Parties shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, (a) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Business, the Transferred Assets and the operations of the
Transferred Entities and the JV Entities relating to any Tax period beginning
on or before the Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations, (b) abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any Taxing Authority, and (c) give the other Party ninety (90) days
written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books
and records and, if the other Party so requests, Buyer or Seller shall, and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, allow the other to take
possession of such books and records. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, Seller shall not be required to provide to any
Person, before, on or after the Closing Date, any right to access or to
review any Tax Return or Tax work papers of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller
(including any Seller Group Tax Return and any pro forma Tax Return used to
create any such Seller Group Tax Return).

Section 6.04. _Buyer Covenants_. __ Buyer covenants that it will not
cause or permit any Transferred Entity or JV Entity, or any Affiliate of Buyer
with respect to any Transferred Entity or JV Entity (a) to make any election
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3 that is effective on or
before the day after the Closing Date, (b) except for the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections, to make an election under Section 336 or Section 338 of the Code
(or any comparable applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law),
(c) to make any other election with respect to Taxes that has retroactive
effect to any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (d) except
as required pursuant to a determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law) with
respect to a Tax Claim governed by  _Section_ __ _ 6.07_, to amend any Tax
Return of any Transferred Entity or JV Entity that covers a Tax period ending
on or prior to the Closing Date, (e) to grant an extension of any applicable
statute of limitations with respect to, any Tax Return of any Transferred
Entity or JV Entity that covers a Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, (f) to file any voluntary disclosure agreement, participate in any
arrangement similar to a voluntary disclosure agreement, or voluntarily
approach any Taxing Authority regarding any Taxes or Tax Returns of any
Transferred Entity or JV for any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, or (g) take any action outside of the ordinary course of business on
the Closing Date after the Closing, in each case, without the prior written
consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

Section 6.05. _Tax Sharing Agreements_.

 



90|

    

(a) Seller shall cause any and all existing Tax Sharing Agreements between
any Transferred Entity or JV Entity, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than any Transferred Entity or JV Entity), on the other
hand, to be terminated prior to the Closing and, from and after the Closing,
for none of the Transferred Entities or the JV Entities to have (unless
otherwise specifically provided in the remainder of this _Section_ __ _
6.05_) any rights, obligations or Liabilities thereunder.

 

(b) Buyer shall procure that each Transferred Entity or JV Entity (each
being a " _UK CT Entity_ ") which is in a group for United Kingdom
corporation tax purposes with the Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller (other
than the Transferred Entities and the JV Entities) (any such group being a "
_Seller CT Group_ ") pays to any relevant group member of any relevant Seller
CT Group (the " _Group Member_ ") an amount equal to any payment of United
Kingdom corporation tax which has been discharged by the Group Member on
behalf of the relevant UK CT Entity under a group payment arrangement made
prior to the Closing pursuant to section 36 of the United Kingdom Finance Act
1998 or Section 59F of the United Kingdoms Tax Management Act 1970 (a " _GPA_
"), save to the extent that the relevant UK CT Entity has previously
satisfied its obligations under the GPA. Payment to the Group Member shall be
made on the later of two Business Days after demand is made for it and the due
date for payment to the relevant Taxing Authority of the underlying United
Kingdom corporation tax liability.

(c) Seller shall procure that (i) the representative member of
the Sellers VAT Group will, on or before Closing, give notice to HM Revenue
and Customs (with a copy of such notice given to Buyer) that the relevant
Transferred Entities and JV Entities will, with effect from Closing, cease to
be eligible to be members of the Sellers VAT Group and (ii) will use all
reasonable endeavors to ensure that the relevant Transferred Entities and JV
Entities will cease to be members of Sellers VAT Group with effect from
Closing.

 

(d) Where a UK CT Entity has paid an amount to any relevant Group Member
under Section 6.05(b), Seller shall procure that (i) no amounts apportioned
to the relevant UK CT Entity under the GPA and in respect of which such
payment was made by the UK CT Entity shall be reapportioned under the GPA
without Buyers consent (not to be unreasonably withheld); and (ii) there is
promptly paid to the relevant UK CT Entity an amount equal to (A) any excess
by which the aggregate amount of any payments made under Section 6.05(b) by
that UK CT Entity exceeds the amount of United Kingdom corporation tax
finally apportioned to that entity and in respect of which those payments were
made; and (B) interest on such excess at the rate applicable from time to time
on overpaid United Kingdom corporation tax from the period from the date of
the payment under Section 6.05(b) to the date of the payment under this
Section 6.05(d).

 

(e) Seller shall use reasonable commercial efforts to procure that, with
effect from Closing, each UK CT Entity is removed from any GPA to which they
are party immediately prior to Closing.

(f) Buyer shall procure that any Transferred Entity or JV Entity which,
before Closing, is a member of any Sellers VAT Group (each such entity a "
_VAT Grouped Entity_ ") shall contribute to the representative member of the
Sellers VAT Group such proportion of any VAT for which the representative
member (or equivalent responsible person) of the Sellers VAT Group is
accountable and which is properly attributable to supplies, acquisitions and
importations (" _Supplies_ ") made or deemed to be made by any relevant VAT
Grouped Entity before the Closing (less any amount of deductible input tax
that is properly attributable to such Supplies). Such contribution shall be
made in cleared funds on the day which is the later of two Business Days
after demand is made for it, and two Business Days before the day on which the
representative member is required to account for such VAT to the relevant
Taxing Authority.

 



91|

    

(g) Seller shall pay, or procure to be paid, to a Transferred Entity or JV
Entity an amount equivalent to the proportion of any repayment of VAT received
by the representative member of the Sellers VAT Group from HM Revenue and
Customs or of any credit obtained by reference to an excess of
deductible input tax over output tax that is attributable to Supplies made,
or deemed to be made, by the relevant Transferred Entity or JV Entity while a
member of the Sellers VAT Group (ignoring, for this purpose, the deeming
provisions in section 43(1) of United Kingdom Value Added Tax Act 1994),
provided that such repayment or credit was included as a current asset in the
Final Net Working Capital. Such payment, if due, shall be made within ten (10)
Business Days of receipt by, or offset against a liability of, the
representative member.

(h) In this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_, " _Seller_ __ _s VAT Group_ " means
any group for VAT purposes, of which Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other
than the Transferred Entities and the JV Entities) is the representative
member (or equivalent responsible person).

Section 6.06. _Tax Indemnification_.

 

(a) Except to the extent taken into account as a current liability in the
Final Net Working Capital, Seller hereby indemnifies the Buyer Indemnified
Parties against, and agrees to hold each of them harmless from, any and all
Losses resulting from or arising out of (i) any and all Taxes of or
attributable to the Transferred Entities and the JV Entities with respect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period (as determined in the manner set forth in _Section_
__ _ 6.06(c)_ with respect to any Straddle Tax Period) or arising from any
inclusions under Section 965 of the Code, (ii) any and all Taxes of or
attributable to Seller, any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred
Entities and the JV Entities), any Asset Seller or any Seller Group, (iii) any
and all Taxes resulting from, relating to, arising out of or attributable to
(A) the Retained Businesses or the Retained Assets, (B) the Transferred Assets
or the Business with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (as determined in
the manner set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.06(c)_ with respect to any Straddle
Period), or (C) the payment of the Closing Date Indebtedness or the payment of
any of Sellers fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) without prejudice to
_Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)_, Taxes, including Transfer Taxes, arising from or in
connection with the Reorganization, (v) Taxes of any member of an affiliated,
combined, consolidated or unitary group of which any Transferred Entity or JV
Entity is or was a member prior to the Closing, including pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar provision under any
state, local or non-U.S. Law, (vi) Taxes of any Person imposed on any
Transferred Entity or JV Entity as a successor-in-interest or transferee, by
contract or pursuant to any Law, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction
occurring prior to the Closing, and (vii) any breach of, or failure to
perform, any covenant or obligation of Seller contained in this _ARTICLE VI_
(collectively, " _Seller Taxes_ "); _provided, however_ , that Seller shall
not be required to indemnify for Losses attributable to any Taxes arising
from any breach of, or failure to perform, any covenant or obligation of Buyer
contained in this _ARTICLE VI_.

 

(b) Buyer hereby indemnifies the Seller Indemnified Parties against, and
agrees to hold each of them harmless from, any and all Losses resulting from
or arising out of (i) any breach of, or failure to perform, any covenant or
obligation of Buyer contained in this _ARTICLE VI_ and (ii) any and all Taxes
of the Transferred Entities and JV Entities, and any and all Taxes resulting
from, relating to, arising out of or attributable to the Transferred Assets or
the Business, in each case, with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period, other
than Seller Taxes.

 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Straddle Tax Period,
the portion of such Taxes from any such Straddle Tax Period that are
allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be determined as follows: (i) in
the case of any real property, personal property, ad valorem and similar Taxes
(" _Property Taxes_ "), the amount of such Property Taxes attributable to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Tax Period will be deemed to be the
amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period, 

 



92|

    

 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in
such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date, and the
denominator of which is the number of total days in the entire Straddle Tax
Period; and (ii) in the case of any Income Taxes or any other Taxes that are
not Property Taxes, the amount of any such Taxes attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Tax Period will be computed based on the
interim closing of the books as of and including the Closing Date (and for
such purpose, the Tax period of any applicable pass-through entity for
applicable Tax purposes shall be deemed to close at such time) and Sellers
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Reorganization shall be attributed to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.

(d) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall satisfy any claim under  _Section_
__ _ 6.06(a)_ first from the RandW Policy (to the extent such policy covers
such claim) and then, subject to the limitations in _Section_ __ _ 5.28(c)_
and _(d)_ , from Seller.

 

Section 6.07. _Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims_.

 

(a) If a claim for Taxes, including notice of a pending audit, shall be
made by any Taxing Authority, which, if successful, might reasonably result
in a claim for indemnity pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.06(a)_ (any such claim,
a " _Tax Claim_ "), the Party which receives such claim shall notify the other
Party in writing within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such Tax Claim;
_provided_ , that the failure of a Party to give such notice to the other
Party shall not affect the indemnification provided under _Section_ __ _
6.06(a)_ except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has actually been
materially prejudiced by such failure.

(b) Seller shall control any Tax Claim with respect to any Seller Group
Tax Return, and Buyer shall not participate in or control any such Tax Claim.

 

(c) Except to the extent that the insurer is otherwise entitled to control
pursuant to the terms of the RandW Policy, with respect to any Tax Claim
relating to a Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date not described
in _Section_ __ _ 6.07(b)_, Seller shall have the right to control the
conduct of such Tax Claim unless Seller fails to provide Buyer with written
notice of its election to control such Tax Claim within ten (10) days of
Sellers receipt from Buyer of notice of such Tax Claim in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 6.07(a)_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) Seller shall
keep Buyer reasonably informed as to the status of such Tax Claim, and (ii)
Buyer shall be entitled to participate in any such Tax Claim, if the
resolution of such Tax Claim would reasonably be expected to have a material
effect on the Tax Liability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Entities or the JV Entities) in any Post-Closing Tax Period, and
Seller shall not settle or otherwise compromise such Tax Claim without
Buyers prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. If Seller does not elect to control a Tax Claim
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.07(c)_ within the time period set
forth above, then Buyer shall control such Tax Claim; _provided_ , _however_
, that (A) Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed as to the status of
such Tax Claim and (B) Buyer shall not settle or otherwise compromise such Tax
Claim without Sellers prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(d) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Straddle Tax Period, Buyer
shall have the right to control the conduct of such Tax Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that with respect to any Tax Items in such Tax Claim for which the
resulting Tax Liability Seller would be required to provide indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement, (i) Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed
as to the status of such Tax Items in such Tax Claim and (ii) Seller shall be
entitled to participate in any such Tax Claim with respect to such Tax Items
and Buyer shall not settle or otherwise compromise such Tax Items in such Tax
Claim without Sellers prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 Section 6.08. _Section 338(h_ _)(_ _10) Elections_.

 



93|

    

(a) Seller shall, and Buyer shall cause the applicable Buyer
Designee (such Buyer Designee, which shall be an entity classified as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the " _Section_ __ _
338(h)(10) Purchaser_"), to make a joint election under Section 338(h)(10) of
the Code (and under any comparable provision of applicable state and local
Tax Law) with respect to the Section 338(h)(10) Purchasers purchase (each
such purchase a " _US Qualified Stock Purchase_ ") pursuant to this Agreement
of each Transferred Entity that is (i) classified as a corporation for U.S.
federal income tax purposes and (ii) a member of the Seller Group for U.S.
federal income tax purposes on the Closing Date (collectively, the "
_Section_ __ _ 338(h)(10) Elections_"). Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in
good faith to effect and preserve valid and timely Section 338(h)(10)
Elections; provided, that Buyer and the Section 338(h)(10) Purchaser shall be
solely responsible for filing any Section 338(h)(10) Forms. Except as
otherwise required by applicable Law, for all U.S. federal (and, as
applicable, state and local) income Tax purposes, each of Seller and Buyer
agrees to (and agrees to cause its Affiliates to) (x) treat the US Qualified
Stock Purchases in accordance with applicable Tax Law, including Treasury
Regulations Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 and (y) not take any position on any Tax
Return that is inconsistent with such treatment, except as required pursuant
to a determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any
similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law).

(b) At the Closing, Seller shall deliver to the Buyer a duly executed
Internal Revenue Service Form 8023, Elections Under Section 338 for
Corporations making Qualified Stock Purchases (and, upon prior written request
of Buyer submitted to Seller as soon as practicable after the date hereof and
in no event less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, any
analogous form required to effectuate the Section 338(h)(10) for state or
local Tax purposes) with respect to the Section 338(h)(10) Elections
(collectively, the " _Section_ __ _ 338(h)(10) Forms_"). Seller authorizes
Buyer and the Section 338(h)(10) Purchaser to file each Section 338(h)(10)
Election Form with the appropriate Taxing Authority. If the Buyer determines
that any change is to be made in any previously executed Section 338(h)(10)
Form or other form or documentation required to effect valid and timely
Section 338(h)(10) Elections, then Buyer may prepare a new Section 338(h)(10)
Form or other form or documentation and deliver such new Section 338(h)(10)
Form or other form or documentation to Seller, and Seller shall cause such new
Section 338(h)(10) Form or other form or documentation to be duly executed and
promptly deliver such executed new Section 338(h)(10) Form or other form or
documentation to Buyer.

 

Section 6.09. _Certain Indemnification Payments_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, if and to the extent any
indemnification payment may become due and owing to a Transferred Entity or JV
Entity that would be subject to Tax on the receipt of such payment, such
payment shall instead be due and owing to Buyer (or, where relevant, to the
Buyer Designee which acquired that Transferred Entity or JV Entity). For the
avoidance of doubt, if and to the extent any indemnification payment may
become due and owing to a Transferred Entity or JV Entity organized under the
laws of the United Kingdom pursuant to this Agreement, such payment shall
instead be due and owing to Buyer (or the relevant Buyer Designee where
appropriate).

 

ARTICLE VII

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

Section 7.01. _Business Employees_. No later than fifteen (15) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, or if earlier, a sufficient period prior to
the Closing Date to enable Buyer to comply with applicable Law with respect to
offers of employment under _Section_ __ _ 7.03(a)_, Seller shall deliver an
update of _Section_ __ _ 3.11(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, listing,
as of the most recent date practicable, all Business Employees, at the
Closing, which shall also include an identification number and such Business
Employees title, work location and employer.

 



94|

    

Section 7.02. _Benefit Plans_. Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries
(including, following the Closing, the Transferred Entities or the JV
Entities) will contribute to or assume sponsorship of, or have any other
liability with respect to, any Employee Plan that is sponsored, maintained or
contributed to by Seller or its Subsidiaries (including, following the
Closing, the Transferred Entities or the JV Entities), other than the Assumed
Plans and those arrangements and obligations expressly transferred to
and assumed by Buyer and its Subsidiaries as set forth in this _ARTICLE VII_.

 

Section 7.03. _Transfer of Offered Employees and Transferred
Entity Employees._

(a) No less than ten (10) Business Days prior to and effective as of the
Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, offer
employment to each Offered Employee who (i) is actively employed on such date
or is absent from employment due to vacation or temporary illness not
reasonably expected to exceed five (5) days (the " _Current Offered
Employees_ "), or (ii)(A) is absent from work due to an authorized or
protected leave of absence (including but not limited to a leave of absence
due to a short-term or long-term disability) and (B) has the right to return
to employment following expiration of such absence under applicable Law,
effective as of the expiration of the leave if such Offered Employee is able
to return to active employment within six (6) months after the Closing Date
or such longer period as required by applicable Law (the " _Leave Offered
Employees_ "). All such offers of employment to (I) Current Offered Employees
shall provide for employment with Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer to commence
effective as of 12:00 a.m., local time, on the day immediately following the
Closing Date, and (II) Leave Offered Employees shall provide for employment
with Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer to commence at the expiration of such
Leave Offered Employees authorized or protected leave if such Leave Offered
Employee is able to return to active employment within six (6) months after
the Closing Date or such longer period as required by applicable Law.
With respect to each Offered Employee, each such offer of employment will be
for a position that is comparable to the type of position held by such Offered
Employee, and at the same or reasonably similar geographic location as in
effect as of ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and shall be
made on terms and conditions sufficient to avoid statutory, contractual,
common law or other severance obligations, other than where such severance is
unavoidable pursuant to applicable Law or the terms of any applicable
Bargaining Agreement, and shall otherwise comply in all respects with
applicable Law and the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 7.03_. For the avoidance
of doubt, Buyer shall not be required to make individual offers of employment
to a Transferred Entity Employee, and Seller and Buyer acknowledge that
applicable Law provides for the automatic transfer of the employment of
Transferred Entity Employees upon the purchase of the Transferred Interests
and JV Interests. In the case of Business Employees primarily employed outside
the United States, the Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred
Interests and JV Interests, as applicable following the Closing Date), shall,
in addition to meeting the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 7.03_, comply
with any additional obligations or standards arising under applicable Laws
governing the terms and conditions of their employment or severance or
termination of employment in connection with the transfer of the Business or
otherwise.

(b) Each Offered Employee who accepts an offer of employment from Buyer or
one of its Subsidiaries and commences employment with Buyer or a Subsidiary of
Buyer, together with each Transferred Entity Employee who is employed on the
Closing Date, whether such Transferred Entity Employee is actively employed
on such date, absent from employment due to vacation or temporary illness not
reasonably expected to exceed five (5) days or absent from work due to an
authorized or protected leave of absence (including, but not limited to, a
leave of absence due to a short-term or long-term disability) with the right
to return to employment following expiration of such absence under applicable
Law, shall be referred to herein as a " _Transferred Employee_ ". The date an
Offered Employee commences employment with Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer
(including, following the Closing, the Transferred Entities or the JV
Entities) shall be referred to herein as the Offered Employees " _Transfer
Date_ " (and the Transfer Date for a Transferred Entity Employee who is
employed on the Closing Date shall be the day immediately following the
Closing Date).

 



95|

    

(c) If any Offered Employee requires a work permit or employment pass or
other legal or regulatory approval for his or her employment with Buyer or any
of its Subsidiaries, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
their reasonable efforts to cause any such permit, pass or other approval to
be obtained and in effect prior to the Closing Date. In the event any such
permit, pass or other approval is not obtained and in effect prior to the
Closing Date, for a period of three (3) months following the Closing Date,
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable
efforts to cause any such permit, pass or other approval to be obtained. In
the event any such permit, pass or other approval is not obtained and in
effect within three (3) months following the Closing Date, Buyer shall be
entitled to terminate the employment of such Business Employee , subject to
_Section_ __ _ 7.03(e)_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.11_.

 

(d) For a period beginning on the Transfer Date and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, each Transferred Employee shall be entitled
to receive (while he or she is employed with Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries)
(i) at least the same salary, wages and short-term incentive bonus
opportunities that were provided to such Transferred Employee immediately
prior to the Closing, and (ii) employee benefits (including, without
limitation, equity compensation, retirement and welfare benefits) that are not
materially less favorable in the aggregate than either those
employee benefits (including, without limitation, equity compensation,
retirement and welfare benefits) provided to such Transferred Employee by
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing or those
employee benefits provided by Buyer to similarly situated employees of Buyer
or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , to the extent that the
Transferred Employee is a Non-U.S. Business Employee or a Business Employee
who primarily provides services outside of the United States, such
Transferred Employee shall be entitled to compensation and benefits required
by applicable Law if such compensation and/or benefits are greater than those
set forth in  _clauses_ __ _ (i)_ and _(ii)_ above. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer shall not be obligated to continue to employ any Transferred
Employee for any specific period of time following the Closing Date, subject
to applicable Law. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this _ARTICLE
VII_ or to the extent required by applicable Law, effective as of the Transfer
Date, the Transferred Employees shall cease all active participation in and
accrual of benefits under the Plans, other than the Assumed Plans.

(e) Seller and Buyer intend that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not constitute a separation, termination or severance of
employment of any Business Employee prior to or upon the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein and that the Business Employees who
become Transferred Employees will have continuous and uninterrupted
employment immediately before and immediately after the Closing Date. Buyer
shall bear any costs related to, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller
from and against, (i) any claims made by any Offered Employee for any
statutory, contractual, civil law or common law notice of termination (or pay
in lieu), severance or separation benefits and other legally mandated payment
obligations (including the employer portion of any employment Taxes, together
with any compensation payable during any mandatory termination notice period
related thereto), in each case, arising out of or in connection with the
failure of Buyer or its Subsidiaries to make offers of employment to, or
continue the employment of, any Offered Employee in accordance with this
Agreement and as required by applicable Law and (ii) any claims relating to
the employment of any Transferred Employee on or after the Closing Date,
including in respect of any act or omission relating to the employment of any
Transferred Employee on or after the Closing Date under any applicable
Bargaining Agreement or applicable Law. With respect to each Transferred
Employee, during the period beginning on the Transfer Date and ending on the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer or its Subsidiaries shall provide
severance and termination benefits to each Transferred Employee that are no
less favorable than the greater of (x) those severance and termination
benefits as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.03(e)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule or as otherwise required by an applicable Bargaining Agreement, or
(y) the severance benefits provided by Buyer or its Subsidiaries to its
similarly situated employees, in each case based on such Transferred
Employees compensation as of such employment termination date after taking
into account any service that such Transferred Employee has with Buyer or its
Subsidiaries as of the date of such termination of employment, including, for
the avoidance of doubt, service credited under _Section_ __ _ 7.03(f)_.

 



96|

    

(f) For purposes of participation of a Transferred Employee in a Buyer
Benefit Plan, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to credit each Transferred Employee with all
years of service for which such Transferred Employee was credited before the
Closing Date with Seller or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting of benefits under any comparable Plans,
except to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits for
the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, use
commercially reasonable efforts such that, for purposes of each Buyer Benefit
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Transferred Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements of such Buyer Benefit Plan shall be waived for such
Transferred Employee and his or her covered dependents, and any eligible
expenses incurred by such Transferred Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Plan ending on the date
such Transferred Employees participation in the corresponding Buyer Benefit
Plan begins shall be taken into account under such Buyer Benefit Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Transferred Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid
in accordance with such Buyer Benefit Plan, to the extent permitted under the
terms of such Buyer Benefit Plan.

 

(g) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including, following the
Closing, the Transferred Entities or the JV Entities) to, credit each of the
Transferred Employees with an amount of paid vacation time and sick leave days
following the Closing Date equal to the amount of vacation time and sick leave
days each such Transferred Employee has accrued but not yet used or cashed
out as of the Closing Date under Sellers or its Subsidiaries vacation and
sick leave policies as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. In the
event that any Transferred Employee is entitled under applicable Law to be
paid for any vacation days and paid time off days accrued but not yet taken by
the Transferred Employee as of the Closing Date with respect to the calendar
year in which the Closing Date occurs or with respect to any prior calendar
year and Seller pays such amount to such Transferred Employee after the
Closing Date (any such amounts paid by any Seller, the " _Seller Vacation
Payment_ "), then: (i) within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date,
Seller shall provide to Buyer a schedule setting forth the aggregate amount
of the Seller Vacation Payment, and (ii) Buyer shall reimburse Seller for the
aggregate amount of the Seller Vacation Payment as soon as administratively
practicable but in any event no later than fifteen (15) days following
delivery of such schedule.

 

Section 7.04. _401(k) Plan_. Buyer shall maintain or establish a
defined contribution plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Buyer_
__ _s 401(k) Plan_ "). Prior to the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall
mutually agree to the treatment of participant account balances relating to
the Transferred Employees who are participants in Sellers qualified cash or
deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the "
_Seller_ __ _s 401(k) Plan_ "), with such treatment to provide for either (x)
the opportunity for a participant to elect a "direct rollover" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of his or her account balance
(including earnings thereon through the date of transfer and promissory notes
evidencing all outstanding loans) in accordance with applicable Law or (y) a
"trust-to-trust" transfer of Transferred Employees account balances from the
Sellers 401(k) Plan to Buyers 401(k) Plan in accordance with applicable Law.

 

Section 7.05. _Pension Plan Benefits_.

 



97|

    

(a) _U.S. and U.K_. No assets or liabilities with respect to
the Transferred Employees shall be transferred as a result of this Agreement
from any defined benefit pension plan maintained for Business Employees in the
U.S. or the U.K. and identified as such in Section 3.13(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (each, a " _Seller DB Plan_ ") to any plan or arrangement
established by Buyer or any of Subsidiary of Buyer, and, as of the Closing, no
Transferred Employees shall accrue additional benefits under the applicable
Seller DB Plan (to the extent such accruals have not already ceased).
Benefits accrued by the Transferred Employees under the applicable Seller DB
Plan through the Closing shall be fully vested as of the Closing and shall be
payable to such Transferred Employees pursuant to the terms of, and at the
time and in the amounts provided under, the applicable Seller DB Plan, as may
be amended from time to time.

 

(b) _Belgium and Canada_. As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume all
Liabilities for all accrued benefits in respect of the Transferred Employees
under any (i) defined benefit pension plan maintained for Business Employees
in Belgium and Canada and identified as such in Section 3.12(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (each a " _Transferring DB Plan_ ") in accordance with
applicable Laws and the terms of such Transferring DB Plan (such Liabilities,
the " _Transferred Pension Liabilities_ ") and (ii) all Plans that provide
post-employment health or welfare benefits to Transferred Employees in Canada
(the " _Transferred Canada Welfare Plans_ "). Any assets with respect to any
of the Transferred DB Plans and Transferred Canada Welfare Plans (including,
to the extent applicable, any insurance contracts or portions thereof
maintained with respect to such plan) shall be transferred to Buyer in
connection with the transfer of the Transferred Pension Liabilities.

 

(c) _Statutorily Mandated Arrangements_. For the avoidance of doubt, any
Liability associated with any defined benefit or post-employment payment or
benefit made available to or provided to any Transferred Employee pursuant to
any statutory or governmental mandate that would qualify as a Plan
(notwithstanding that such benefits are excluded from the definition of
"Plan" for purposes of this Agreement) (each, a " _Statutorily Mandated
Benefit Arrangement_ ") shall become a Liability of the Buyer following the
Closing and Buyer shall provide or make available such benefits to
Transferred Employees following the Closing in accordance with applicable Law.

 

Section 7.06. _Equity-Based Awards_.

 

(a) In respect of any performance-vesting stock unit awards that were
granted to any Transferred Employee under the Sellers Long-Term Incentive
Plan in respect of fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018 that are outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Closing (each, a " _Seller PSU Award_ "),
Seller shall ensure that the terms of the Seller PSU Awards provide for pro-
rated vesting of such awards upon the Closing, and Seller shall be solely
responsible for payment of the resulting vested portion of such awards. Buyer
shall, as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, grant to each
holder of a Seller PSU Award, an equity-based, time-vesting incentive award in
respect of Buyer shares of common stock with an aggregate value equal to the
PSU Replacement Incentive Award Value (as defined below), which equity award
will vest on the vesting date that applied to such Seller PSU Award. For
purposes of the foregoing, the PSU Replacement Incentive Award Value will
equal the product of (x) the number of shares of Seller common
stock underlying the Seller PSU Award determined based on actual performance
through the Closing Date and pro-rated to reflect the portion of the original
vesting period that has not yet lapsed as of the Closing Date and (y) the
closing price of a share of Seller common stock on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Closing Date as reported on the New York Stock
Exchange.

 

(b) In respect of any time-vesting restricted stock unit awards that were
granted to any Transferred Employee under the Sellers Long-Term Incentive
Plan for any fiscal year other than those made with respect to fiscal year
2018 that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing (each, a "
_Seller RSU Award_ "), Seller shall ensure that the terms of such awards
provide for accelerated vesting upon the Closing to the extent that such
awards would have vested in the ordinary course through November

 



98|

    

 10, 2019, and Seller shall be solely responsible for payment of the
resulting vested portion of such awards. Buyer shall, as soon as practicable
following the Closing Date, grant to each holder of a Seller RSU Award, an
equity-based, time-vesting incentive award in respect of Buyer shares of
common stock with an aggregate value equal to the RSU Replacement Incentive
Award Value (as defined below) and which will vest in accordance with
the same vesting schedule that applied to the Seller RSU Award. For purposes
of the foregoing, the RSU Replacement Incentive Award Value will equal the
product of (x) the number of shares of Seller common stock underlying the
Seller RSU Award which would have vested in the ordinary course after
November 10, 2019 (notwithstanding the occurrence of the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement), and (y) the closing price of a share of
Seller common stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing
Date as reported on the New York Stock Exchange.

 

Section 7.07. _Nonqualified Deferred Compensation_. With respect to
each nonqualified deferred compensation plan that permits elective deferrals
by participants, is maintained by Seller and in which any Transferred Employee
participates (each, a " _Seller Deferred Compensation Plan_ "), the Buyer and
Seller agree that a mirror plan replicating the terms and conditions of such
plan (each such mirror plan, a " _Buyer Deferred Compensation Plan_ ") will be
established prior to the Closing. Buyer and Seller agree that the
Liabilities associated with each Transferred Employee that maintains an
account balance under each Seller Deferred Compensation Plan will be
transferred to a Buyer Deferred Compensation Plan at the Closing (such
transferred liabilities calculated in accordance with GAAP, the " _Seller
Deferred Compensation Liabilities_ "). As of the Closing, Seller will transfer
to Buyer assets having a value equal to the then-current present value of the
Seller Deferred Compensation Liabilities, and to the extent practicable, the
transfer of such assets will include the transfer or assignment of any
insurance policies maintained by Seller with respect to the Seller Deferred
Compensation Liabilities.

 

Section 7.08. _Allocation of Employment Liabilities._

 

(a) Except with respect to any Liabilities that transfer to Buyer or any if
its Subsidiaries pursuant to applicable Law (including any Liabilities
relating to any current or former Business Employee of a Transferred Entity or
JV Entity or any Assumed Plan) or as otherwise specifically provided in this
Agreement (including, for the sake of clarity,  _Section_ __ _ 7.08(c)_),
the Sellers shall assume or retain, as applicable, Liability and
responsibility for all employment and employee-benefit related Liabilities,
obligations, claims or losses that arise as a result of an event or events
that occurred prior to the Closing Date that relate to the Business Employees
(or any dependent or beneficiary of any Business Employee). Seller shall bear
any costs related to, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and
its Subsidiaries from and against any claims related to, the Liabilities
assumed or retained by the Sellers pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence.

 

(b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement (including,
for the sake of clarity,  _Section_ __ _ 7.08(c)_), effective as of the
Closing Date, Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities
and JV Entities) shall assume or retain, as applicable, and be solely
responsible for all employment and employee-benefits related Liabilities,
obligations, claims or losses that relate to (i) any Transferred Entity
Employee (or his or her dependent or beneficiary) that arise as a result of an
event or events that occurred before, on or after the Closing Date, (ii) any
Assumed Plan that arise as a result of an event or events that occurred
before, on or after the Closing Date, and (iii) any Transferred Employee (or
any dependent or beneficiary of any Transferred Employee) that arise as a
result of an event or events that occurred on or after the Closing Date or are
otherwise expressly assumed by Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including the
Transferred Entities) pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer shall bear any costs
related to, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and the Asset
Sellers from and against any claims related to, the Liabilities assumed or
retained by the Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities
and JV Entities) pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.

 



99|

    

(c) The Sellers shall retain all Liabilities and obligations for
all short- and long-term disability, medical, U.S. retiree medical,
prescription drug, dental, vision, life insurance, accidental death and
dismemberment and other welfare benefit claims incurred by Business Employees
prior to the Closing Date that are covered under the terms of the applicable
Plans, except that Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall be responsible for such
claims to the extent such claims relate to an Assumed Plan. No Assumed Plan
provides for U.S. retiree medical benefits. With respect to claims incurred
on or after the Closing Date by the Transferred Employees and their eligible
dependents for short- and long-term disability, medical, prescription drug,
dental, vision, life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment and other
welfare benefit claims, Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall be responsible. For
these purposes, a claim shall be deemed to be incurred: (A) in the case of
short- or long-term disability benefits (including related health benefits),
at the time of the injury, sickness or other event giving rise to the claim
for such benefits, (B) in the case of medical, prescription drug, dental or
vision benefits, at the time professional services, equipment or prescription
drugs covered by the applicable plan are obtained, (C) in the case of life
insurance benefits, upon death, and (D) in the case of accidental death and
dismemberment benefits, at the time of the accident. The Buyer shall assume or
retain all Liabilities and obligations for all workers compensation claims
incurred by Business Employees, whenever incurred.

 

Section 7.09. _WARN Act_. Buyer agrees to provide, or cause its
Subsidiaries to provide, any required notice under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (" _WARN_ ") and any similar federal,
state or local Law or regulation, and to otherwise comply with WARN and any
other similar Law or regulation, in each case with respect to any "plant
closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in WARN) or group termination or similar
event affecting Employees (including as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) and occurring on and after the Closing Date.
None of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries shall take any action after the
Closing Date that would cause any termination of employment of any Business
Employees that occurs before the Closing to constitute a "plant closing" or
"mass layoff" or group termination under WARN or any similar federal, state or
local Law or regulation, or to create any Liability or penalty to Seller for
any employment terminations under applicable Law.

Section 7.10. _Bargaining Agreements_. Without limiting the generality of
the provisions in this _ARTICLE VII_ , from and after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, comply with the terms of the
Bargaining Agreements and with applicable Law (including local
legislation) and to assume all obligations under the Bargaining Agreements,
including, without limitation, any duty to recognize or bargain with a union
imposed by applicable Law.

 

Section 7.11. _Bonuses_. Buyer agrees that as soon as practicable
following the Closing Date, each Transferred Employee who is entitled to an
annual bonus in respect of Sellers fiscal year 2019, shall be paid (i) his or
her annual bonus calculated based on actual performance through the Closing
Date and (ii) the amount budgeted by Seller for allocation to such Business
Employee (if any) as a discretionary bonus, in each case as accrued and
reflected in the Net Working Capital and pro-rated to reflect the portion of
the Sellers fiscal year 2019 that has lapsed as of the Closing Date.

 

Section 7.12. _Seller Fiscal Year 2019 LTI/Retention Awards_. Seller
agrees that in lieu of granting awards under the Sellers Long-Term Incentive
Plan to Business Employees in the ordinary course in respect of Sellers
fiscal year 2019, Seller will grant to eligible Business Employees as
determined by Seller consistent with past practice, a long-term cash
incentive award which will vest in equal annual installments over a two- or
three- year period (the " _Seller LTI Retention Awards_ "). As soon
as practicable following the Closing Date, Seller shall or cause any of its
Subsidiaries to pay to each of those Transferred Employees described in
Retention Group 1 as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.12_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules who is a holder of a Seller LTI Retention Award as of
immediately prior to Closing a cash payment equal to 20% of the aggregate
value of the Seller LTI Retention Award. Buyer shall assume the obligation to
pay (x) the remaining 80% of the value of the Seller LTI Retention Awards
awarded to holders in Retention

 



100|

    

 Group 1 and (y) 100% of the value of the Seller LTI Retention Awards granted

specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made and
this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and have no effect,
without any Liability on the part of any Party hereto (or of any of its

that notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, (i) _
Section_ __ _ 5.19(b)_, this  _Section_ __ _ 9.02,_ and _ARTICLE X_ hereof
shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) no such termination
shall relieve any Party of any Liability to any other Party resulting from any

 promptly, but in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the date
of such termination, pay or cause to be paid to Seller or its designees an
amount equal to $99,000,000 (the " _CFIUS Liquidated Damages_ ") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds. If Buyer fails to pay the CFIUS
Liquidated Damages when due, and, in order to obtain such payment, Seller
commences an Action that results in a judgment against Buyer for the CFIUS

Liquidated Damages, (A) interest on the CFIUS Liquidated Damages from the date

and (B) Sellers costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees)
arising from or in connection with such Action. Solely for purposes of
establishing the basis for the amount thereof, and without in any way
increasing the amount of the CFIUS Liquidated Damages or expanding the
circumstances in which the CFIUS Liquidated Damages is to be paid, it is
agreed that the CFIUS Liquidated Damages is a liquidated damage, and not a
penalty. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Buyer be required to
pay the CFIUS Liquidated Damages on more than one occasion, and in
circumstances where Buyer has paid the CFIUS Liquidated Damages such CFIUS
Liquidated Damages shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller and its
Affiliates against Buyer and its Affiliates and the Financing Sources as a
result of the related termination or otherwise relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby (whether framed in tort, contract or
otherwise).

(c) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this 
_Section_ __ _ 9.02_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not
enter into this Agreement.

affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall

of this Agreement, or to enforce compliance with the covenants and agreements
of such Party under this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or

the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with such Order or injunction. Each
Party further agrees that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this 
_Section_ __ _ 10.10_, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to
seek any other form of relief that may be available to such Party under this
Agreement in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the
event that the remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 10.10_ are not
available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 10.10_ shall require any Party to institute any Action for
(or limit any Partys right to institute any Action for) specific performance
