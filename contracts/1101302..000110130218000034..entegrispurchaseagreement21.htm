in this Agreement, and in reliance upon the covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties of the Stockholder contained herein, at the
Closing, but effective as of the Effective Time:

(a)Buyer shall purchase and acquire from the Stockholder, and the Stockholder
shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Buyer, all right, title
and interest of the Stockholder in and to the SUSA Shares, free and clear of
all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances of the nature described in
clause (f) of the definition thereof) and any and all restrictions on voting,
transfer, receipt of income or assets upon liquidation, or exercise of any
other attribute of ownership or other rights (other than restrictions arising
under applicable securities Laws) ("Restrictions").

(b)Pursuant to an agreement between China Asset Buyer and China Asset Seller,
substantially as attached as Exhibit D hereto (the "Local China Purchase
Agreement"), the China Asset Buyer shall purchase and acquire from the China
Asset Seller, and the China Asset Seller shall sell, assign, transfer, convey
and deliver to the China Asset Buyer, all right, title and interest of the
China Asset Seller in and to all of the assets, properties and rights of the
China Asset Seller of every kind and nature, whether real, personal or mixed,
intellectual, tangible or intangible, that primarily relate to the Business
and that are localized in the China Asset Seller's Shanghai office (including,
without limitation, all assets of the China Asset Seller set forth on Schedule
2.01(b) hereto) but excluding Stockholder Retained Assets (the "Purchased
Assets"), free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted
Encumbrances). Title to the Purchased Assets shall pass from the China Asset 

Seller to the China Asset Buyer at the Effective Time (despite the deferred
nature of the payment of the Deferred China Asset Purchase Price).
Additionally, the China Asset Buyer shall assume and agrees to pay, perform
and discharge, as and when due, the liabilities of the China Asset Seller that
are described on Schedule 2.01(b) hereto (the "Assumed Liabilities"). For the
avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged and agreed that all assets of the China
Asset Seller other than the Purchased Assets (including, without limitation,
all assets of the China Asset Seller set forth on Schedule 2.01(b)) (the
"Excluded Assets") and all liabilities of the China Asset Seller other than
the Assumed Liabilities (including, without limitation, all liabilities of the
China Asset Seller set forth on Schedule 2.01(b)) (the "Excluded Liabilities")
shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed or delivered to, or assumed
by, as applicable, the China Asset Buyer and shall remain the sole and
exclusive property of, and responsibility of, the China Asset Seller following
the Closing.

(c)The Parties acknowledge and agree that the implementation of the
transactions contemplated by Section 2.01(b) needs to be effected, recorded
and perfected at the Closing pursuant to the Local China Purchase Agreement
and certain other similar short-form transfer agreements, including, as
necessary, notices of transfer, notarial deeds, powers of attorney and other
ancillary agreements and documents, in all cases, subject to and conforming
with the requirements of applicable local Laws (on a country-by-country basis)
and the charter or similar governing documents of the China Asset Seller
(collectively, the "Local Agreements"). For the avoidance of doubt, each
applicable Local Agreement has been entered into solely for the purpose of
implementing the sale, purchase and delivery of the Purchased Assets to be
sold by the China Asset Seller, and the assignment and assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities to be assumed by the China Asset Buyer, in each case, as
provided under the provisions of this Agreement. In the event of any conflict
between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any Local Agreement, the
terms of this Agreement shall prevail. The Buyer Parties shall not be
permitted to bring any claim for Losses against any Seller Party or any of
their respective Affiliates in respect of, under or based upon any Local
Agreement, it being acknowledged and agreed that all rights and remedies in
respect of the Transaction are set forth in, and shall be governed by, this
Agreement.

(d)At any time and from time to time following the Closing, if any assets,
rights or properties that properly constitute assets of the Business
(including as needed to make the representation in Section 4.07(c) true and
correct) were not transferred to the Buyer Parties at Closing, the Stockholder
shall, at its own cost and expense, promptly transfer and deliver (or to cause
to be transferred and delivered) such assets to the applicable Buyer Party
without the payment of any further consideration therefor. At any time
following the Closing, if any assets, rights or properties that did not
properly constitute assets of the Business as of the Closing Date were
inadvertently transferred to any Buyer Party at Closing, then each applicable
Buyer Party shall, at such Buyer Party's cost and expense, promptly transfer
and deliver (or to cause to be transferred and delivered) any and all of such
assets to the Stockholder or, at the Stockholder's request, an Affiliate of
Stockholder, without the payment by Stockholder or any such Affiliate of any
consideration therefor.

Section 2.02 New Proceeds; Payment at Closing. 

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, in
reliance upon the covenants, agreements, representations and warranties of the
Stockholder contained herein, and in consideration of the aforesaid sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance and delivery of the SUSA Shares and the
Purchased Assets to the Buyer Parties, Buyer Parties shall assume the Assumed
Liabilities and pay or cause to be paid an amount of cash equal to the Net
Proceeds in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.02.

(b)At Closing, the Buyer Parties shall pay or cause to be paid, (y) if the
amount of the Pre-Closing Estimated Working Capital exceeds the amount of the

Pre-Closing Estimated Cash plus the amount of such excess minus the Pre-
Closing Estimated Accrued Taxes, or (z) if the amount of the Pre-Closing
Estimated Working Capital is less than the amount of the Target Working
Capital, an amount equal to the Base Purchase Price plus the Pre-Closing
Estimated Cash minus the amount of such deficit minus the Pre-Closing
Estimated Accrued Taxes (as the case may be, the "Closing Payment"), as
follows, by wire transfer of immediately available U.S. funds to such
account(s) and pursuant to such wire instructions as are designated by the

the transactions contemplated hereby, together with the employer portion of
any payroll Taxes due in connection with all of the foregoing payments, shall
be paid to the payroll account of SPG and/or the Stockholder (or one or more

(including pursuant to the covenants and agreements set forth in Section 6.21
hereof) and the remittance of any payroll Taxes in accordance with applicable
Laws; ("Bonus Payments", and together with the Closing Debt and Transaction
Expenses, the "Settlement Amounts");

to the provisions of Section 6.22 hereof); and

(vi)the remaining balance of the Closing Payment (such payment combined with
the payments in Section 2.02(b)(iv) and (v), the "Seller Party Proceeds")
shall be paid to the Stockholder.

shall prepare and deliver to Buyer an estimated balance sheet of the Business

Estimated Balance Sheet (such estimate, the "Pre-Closing Estimated Accrued
Taxes"), (iv) each of the Settlement Amounts and (v) Seller Party Proceeds
(such certificate, the "Estimated Closing Certificate"). All amounts set forth
in the Estimated Closing Certificate shall be prepared by the Stockholder in
accordance with the Accounting Methods and otherwise in a manner, and shall be
in a form, consistent with the calculation and determination of Working
Capital set forth on Exhibit D hereto.

(b)No later than ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare, in good faith, and deliver to the Stockholder a balance sheet of the
Business (the "Proposed Closing Balance Sheet") and a certificate setting
forth Buyer's good faith calculation of (i) Working Capital as of the
Effective Time as derived therefrom (as calculated by Buyer, the "Proposed
Closing Working Capital"), (ii) Cash and Cash Equivalents as of the Effective
Time (as calculated by Buyer, the "Proposed Closing Cash"), (iii) Accrued
Taxes as of the Effective Time as derived from the Proposed Closing Balance
Sheet ("Proposed Closing Accrued Taxes"), (iv) each of the Settlement Amounts
and (v) Seller Party Proceeds (such certificate, the "Proposed Closing
Certificate"). All amounts set forth in such certificate shall be prepared by
Buyer in accordance with the Accounting Methods and otherwise in a manner, and

(c)Following receipt of the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed
Closing Certificate, the Stockholder may review the same and, within thirty
(30) days after the date of such receipt, may deliver to Buyer a certificate
setting forth its specific objections, if any, to the Proposed Closing Balance
Sheet and the amounts set forth in the Proposed Closing Certificate, together
with a summary of the reasons therefor and calculations which, in the view of
the Stockholder, are necessary to eliminate such objections (the "Objection
Certificate"). If the Stockholder does not deliver an Objection Certificate
within such thirty (30) day period, the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet and the
amounts set forth in the Proposed Closing Certificate shall be deemed to be
final and binding as the Final Closing Balance Sheet, the Final Closing
Working Capital, the Final Closing Cash, the Final Closing Accrued Taxes and
the Final Closing Settlement Amounts for purposes of this Agreement. In the
event that the Stockholder does deliver an Objection Certificate within such
thirty (30) day period, the specific items identified in the Objection
Certificate shall be deemed to be in dispute and all other undisputed portions
of the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet and the undisputed amounts set forth in
the Proposed Closing Certificate shall be deemed to be final and binding among
the Parties. 

(d)If the Stockholder delivers an Objection Certificate within such thirty
(30) day period, Buyer and the Stockholder shall each use reasonable efforts
to resolve by written agreement (the "Agreed Adjustments") any disputes as to
the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet and the amounts set forth in the Proposed
Closing Certificate. If the Stockholder and Buyer so resolve any (but not all)
such disputes, the agreed-upon portions of the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet
and the Proposed Closing Certificate shall be deemed to be final and binding
among the Parties. If the Stockholder and Buyer so resolve all such disputes,
the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed Closing Certificate, as
adjusted by the Agreed Adjustments, shall be deemed to be final and binding as
the Final Closing Balance Sheet, the Final Closing Working Capital, the Final
Closing Cash, the Final Closing Accrued Taxes and the Final Closing Settlement
Amounts for purposes of this Agreement.

(e)If any objections raised by the Stockholder in the Objection Certificate
are not resolved by Agreed Adjustments within the thirty (30) day period
following Buyer's receipt of the Objection Certificate then, within seven (7)
Business Days after the end of such thirty (30)-day period, the objections
that remain unresolved (the "Disputed Items"), together with any supporting
documentation as either Buyer or the Stockholder may choose to submit, shall
be submitted by the Stockholder and Buyer for final binding resolution to the
Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant shall act as an accounting
expert and not as an arbitrator, and shall issue a final and binding
resolution with respect to all Disputed Items. Buyer and the Stockholder agree
to execute, if requested by the Independent Accountant, a reasonable
engagement letter, and shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Independent
Accountant to issue its written determination as to such Disputed Items, which
shall be within the range of the respective positions taken by each of Buyer
and the Stockholder, within twenty (20) Business Days after such Disputed
Items have been so submitted to the Independent Accountant, and the
determination by the Independent Accountant as to the resolution of all such
Disputed Items will be final and binding among the Parties and shall not be
subject to dispute, appeal, Proceeding or challenge for any reason, absent
fraud or manifest error. The costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant
shall be borne and paid by either the Buyer Parties (jointly and severally, on
the one hand) or the Stockholder (on the other hand) as determined by the
Independent Accountant (with the Independent Accountant being instructed by
the Parties to assign responsibility for its costs and expenses on a pro rata
basis based upon the degree to which the Independent Accountant has accepted
the respective positions of Buyer and the Stockholder, which shall be
determined by the Independent Accountant and set forth in the final
determinations prepared by such Independent Accountant). The Proposed Closing
Balance Sheet, the Proposed Closing Working Capital, the Proposed Closing
Cash, the Proposed Closing Accrued Taxes and the proposed Settlement Amounts,
after giving effect to any Agreed Adjustments and to the resolution of
Disputed Items by the Independent Accountant, shall be deemed to be final and
binding as the Final Closing Balance Sheet, the Final Closing Working Capital,
the Final Closing Cash, the Final Closing Accrued Taxes and the Final Closing
Settlement Amounts for purposes of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
the procedures set forth in this Section 2.03 shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy with respect to the final determination of the Final Closing Balance
Sheet, the Final Closing 

Working Capital, the Final Closing Cash, the Final Closing Accrued Taxes and
the Final Closing Settlement Amounts.

(f)Each Party hereto shall make available to the other Parties and, if
applicable, the Independent Accountant, such books, records and other
information as any of the foregoing may reasonably request to prepare and
review the Pre-Closing Estimated Balance Sheet and the various amounts set
forth in the Estimated Closing Certificate, the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet
and the various amounts set forth in the Proposed Closing Certificate or any
Disputed Items submitted to the Independent Accountant.

(g)If any of the Final Closing Working Capital, the Final Closing Cash, the
Final Closing Accrued Taxes or any component of the Final Closing Settlement
Amounts (as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.03(c), (d) or (e) hereof)
differs from the estimated amounts thereof set forth in the Estimated Closing
Certificate, the Net Proceeds and the Seller Party Proceeds shall be
recalculated using such final figures in lieu of such estimated figures.
Promptly (but not later than five (5) Business Days) after the final and
binding determination of the Final Closing Balance Sheet and such recalculated
amounts pursuant to this Section 2.03:

(i)If the Seller Party Proceeds as recalculated pursuant to this Section
2.03(g) is less than the estimated Seller Party Proceeds set forth in the
Estimated Closing Certificate, the Stockholder will pay to Buyer, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account(s) as Buyer shall
designate in writing to the Stockholder, the amount of such shortfall.

(ii)If the Seller Party Proceeds as recalculated pursuant to this Section
2.03(g) is greater than the estimated Seller Party Proceeds set forth in the
Estimated Closing Certificate, the Buyer Parties will, jointly and severally,
pay to the Stockholder, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
such bank account(s) as the Stockholder shall designate in writing to Buyer,
the amount of such excess.

Section 2.04 Tax Withholding. The Buyer Parties shall be entitled to (i)
deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted or withheld) from any
consideration payable pursuant to the Transaction Documents to the Seller
Parties or any other Person such amounts, if any, as are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom or in connection therewith under any applicable
Tax Law or legal requirement and (ii) to require any necessary Tax forms,
including Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or the applicable series of IRS
Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar information, from the Seller Parties
or any other Person to whom a payment is required to be made pursuant to the
Transaction Documents. Buyer shall provide the Stockholder with prompt written
notice reasonably detailing any amounts required to be deducted or withheld
from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents and shall identify the applicable Tax Law under which the deduction
or withholding is required, provide the Seller Parties with the opportunity to
furnish any necessary Tax forms in order to avoid or reduce such withholding
in advance of Buyer deducting or withholding from any consideration payable
pursuant to this Agreement or the Transaction Documents; provided that such
opportunity does not subject the Buyer Parties or any other Person to any
potential liability to a relevant Taxing Authority for any claimed withholding
and payment or otherwise result in adverse Tax 

consequences to the Buyer Parties. To the extent such amounts are so deducted
or withheld, such amounts shall be timely remitted to the proper Governmental
Authority and shall be treated for all purposes under the Transaction
Documents as having been paid to the Seller Party or to the Person,
respectively, to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

Section 6.13 Tax Matters.

(a)Pre-Closing Tax Periods; Tax Returns. In connection with the preparation of
Tax Returns, audits, inquiries, examinations and any administrative or
judicial Proceedings relating to any Tax liabilities imposed on or in respect
of the Acquired Companies, the Purchased Assets or the Business for all
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax
Periods"), Buyer Parties, on the one hand, and the Seller Parties, on the
other hand, shall cooperate fully with each other, including the furnishing or
making available during normal business hours of records, personnel (as
reasonably required), books of account, powers of attorney or other materials
necessary or helpful for the preparation of such Tax Returns, the conduct of
audits, inquiries, examinations and any administrative or judicial proceedings
or the defense of claims by Taxing Authorities as to the imposition of Taxes
and any assessment or reassessment in respect of Taxes. The Stockholder shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and timely file, or cause to be timely
filed, all income Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period that are filed with any Taxing Authority before or after the
Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be true, correct and complete in all
material respects and accurately set forth all items to the extent required to
be reflected or included in such Tax Returns by applicable Federal, state,
local or non-U.S. Tax Laws. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with those prepared for prior taxable periods unless a different
treatment of any item is required by applicable Law. Stockholder shall deliver
only those Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies which are filed after the
Closing to Buyer for its review and comment at least thirty (30) days prior to
the applicable filing deadline, and shall consider in good faith all
reasonable comments provided by Buyer with respect thereto. The Stockholder
shall (or shall cause its relevant Affiliates to) timely pay to the
appropriate Taxing Authority all Taxes shown on any Tax Return filed pursuant
to this Section 6.13(a) as and when required by Law, except to the extent such
Taxes are accrued for or counted as a liability in the calculation of the Net
Proceeds as is finally determined in accordance with Section 2.03 hereof.

(b)Amendments of Pre-Closing Tax Returns. No Buyer Parties, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, shall amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax
Return or Tax election of the Acquired Companies with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of the Stockholder (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). After the
Closing Date, one or more of the Seller Parties may amend, refile or revoke or
otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election of any Acquired Company or the
China Asset Seller with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period: (i) without the
consent of any Buyer Parties, provided that such amendment, refiling,
revocation or modification does not adversely affect the Tax liability of any
Acquired Company or the China Asset Buyer for any taxable year (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date; and (ii) with the prior written
consent of the Buyer Parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), if such amendment, refiling, revocation or
modification may reasonably adversely affect the Tax liability of any Acquired 

Company or the China Asset Buyer for any taxable year (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date.

(c)Straddle Periods. In the case of any Taxes of the Acquired Companies, the
Purchased Assets or the Business that are payable with respect to any Tax
period beginning before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date
(each a "Straddle Period"), the portion of any such Taxes attributable to the
pre-Closing portion of such Straddle Period shall: (i) in the case of Taxes
that are either (A) based upon or related to income or receipts or (B) imposed
in connection with any sale, transfer or assignment or any deemed sale,
transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible),
be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the Tax year or period
ended on the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of Taxes (other than those
described in clause (i) above) that are imposed on a periodic basis with
respect to the Acquired Companies, the Purchased Assets or the Business, or
otherwise measured by the level of any item, be deemed to be the amount of
such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes
determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately
preceding Tax period) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire Straddle Period. For purposes of clause (i) of the preceding
sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or other item (including the effect
of any graduated rates of Tax) that is calculated on an annual basis shall be
allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date on
a pro rata basis determined by multiplying the total amount of such item
allocated to the Straddle Period times a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire Straddle Period. All determinations necessary to give effect to
the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with the past
practice of the Acquired Companies. In the case of Tax Returns to be filed
with respect to a Straddle Period, the Buyer Parties shall, except as
otherwise required by applicable Law, prepare such Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with past practice, and timely file such Tax Returns with the
applicable Taxing Authority, provided that, with respect to any Tax Returns
addressed by this Section 6.13(c) that includes Pre-Closing Taxes, Buyer
Parties shall deliver any such Tax Return to the Stockholder for its review at
least thirty (30) days prior to the date such Tax Return is required to be
filed (including extensions) and the Buyer Parties shall consider in good
faith comments provided by Stockholder with respect thereto. The Stockholder
shall promptly pay to the Buyer Parties all Pre-Closing Taxes shown on any
Straddle Period Tax Return filed pursuant to this Section 6.13(c), except to
the extent such Taxes are accrued for or counted as a liability in the
calculation of the Net Proceeds as is finally determined in accordance with
Section 2.03 hereof.

(d)Records Relating to Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Seller Parties shall provide
Buyer Parties with all Tax Returns (and other information relating to Taxes,
including all Tax work papers, accounting workpapers relating to Taxes and
files) of or relating solely to the Acquired Companies. The Seller Parties and
the Buyer Parties shall (and the Buyer Parties shall cause the Acquired
Companies to) (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Acquired Companies, the Business and the Purchased Assets 

relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by the Stockholder or Buyer to the other Party, any extension
thereof) for the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record
retention Laws and agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority, and (ii)
give the other Party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and shall allow the
notified Party to take possession of such books and records, other than any
information that the notifying Party reasonably believes to be privileged.

(e)Certain Taxes. Subject to the provisions in Section 6.22(c), all transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added and other such Taxes
and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with
the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement (but expressly excluding (i)
any Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Restructuring which shall be borne
by the Seller Parties and (ii) any China VAT which shall be payable solely by
the Buyer Parties, jointly and severally, as provided in Section 6.19 in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Local
China Purchase Agreement and the payment of the China Asset Purchase Price as
contemplated therein) (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), will be paid and borne
fifty percent (50%) by the Seller Parties and fifty percent (50%) by the Buyer
Parties; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, any Transfer Taxes that would not have been imposed but for the
failure of a Party (or any of its Affiliates) to meet any material or formal
requirement with which such Party (or any of its Affiliates) is legally
eligible to comply under applicable Law shall be borne one hundred percent
(100%) by the Party who fails (or whose Affiliate fails) to so comply. The
purchase prices hereunder shall be exclusive of all applicable Transfer Taxes.
Subject to the provisions of Section 6.13(f) and Section 9.02, all necessary
Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to Transfer Taxes will be
prepared and filed when due by the Party primarily or customarily responsible
under the applicable local Law for filing such Tax Returns and other
documentation, and such Party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
provide such Tax Returns or other documentation to the other Party at least
ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date. For the avoidance of doubt,
Section 6.13(b) and (c) shall not apply for any Tax Returns for Transfer
Taxes. Each Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to minimize
the amount of such Transfer Taxes that is mutually agreeable and in compliance
with applicable Law, cooperate in the preparation, execution (to include
joining such returns where required) and filing of all such Tax Returns and
other documentation, and permit any such Transfer Taxes to be assessed and
paid in accordance with applicable Law.

(f)Refunds and Credits.

(i)If either the Buyer Parties or the Seller Parties (the "Paying Party") pays
a Tax for which the other (the "Non-Paying Party") is liable in accordance
with Article VI or Section 9.02 of the Agreement, the Paying Party shall be
entitled to reimbursement from the Non-Paying Party in accordance with this
Section 6.13(f)(i). Upon payment of any such Tax, the Paying Party shall
present a statement to the Non-Paying Party setting forth the amount of
reimbursement to which the Paying Party is entitled, together with such
supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount to be
reimbursed. The Non-Paying Party shall make such reimbursement promptly, in 

immediately available funds, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
after the presentation of such statement.

(ii)Any Tax refund received by any Buyer Parties or any Acquired Company (or
any of their respective Affiliates) within four (4) years following the
Closing Date, and any amounts credited against any Tax to which any Buyer
Party or any Acquired Company (or any of their respective Affiliates) shall
become entitled, which refund or credit relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period (the "Pre-Closing Tax Refunds
and Credits"), shall be for the account of the Seller Parties. Any Pre-Closing
Tax Refunds and Credits due and owing to a Seller Party pursuant to this
Section 6.13(f)(ii) shall be paid by the Buyer Parties within ten (10)
Business Days after receipt or utilization thereof by bank wire transfer of
immediately available funds; provided, however, that Buyer may offset the
amount of any Pre-Closing Tax Refund and Credit payable hereunder by the
amount of any Tax liabilities due and owing to the Buyer Parties pursuant to
Stockholder's indemnification obligations set forth in Section 9.02 (to the
extent that such indemnification claims have been resolved in favor of the
Buyer Parties pursuant to Section 6.13(g) and Section 9.05 below). In
addition, the Buyer Parties shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Seller
Parties an amount equal to any refund of Taxes that would have been payable to
the Seller Parties pursuant to this Section 6.13, except that such refund was
used to pay or credited against Post-Closing Taxes. Any Post-Closing Tax
refunds that are received by Seller Parties or any of its Affiliates, and any
amounts credited against Post-Closing Taxes to which Seller Parties or any of
their Affiliates becomes entitled, shall be for the account of Buyer Parties.
Each Party shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the other Party an amount equal
to such refund or credit within ten (10) Business Days after receipt or
utilization thereof by bank wire transfer of immediately available funds. If
any refund, credit or offset of Taxes described in this Section 6.13(f)(ii)
that is paid, offset or credited to a Party is subsequently reduced or
disallowed as a result of an audit, such Party that received the payment,
offset or credit shall promptly pay the amount so reduced or disallowed to
such other Party.

(g)Tax Audits and Contests.

(i)After the Closing, unless Buyer has previously received written notice from
Stockholder, Buyer shall promptly notify the Stockholder in writing within ten
(10) Business Days of receipt of any demand, claim or notice of the
commencement of an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding involving
any asserted Tax liability or refund with respect to any Acquired Company, the
Purchased Assets or the Business relating to Taxes ("Contest") that are or may
be the Seller Parties' responsibility under this Agreement ("Seller Contest")
received by any Buyer Party, any Acquired Company or any Affiliate of any of
the foregoing, but failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Seller
Parties of any liability hereunder except to the extent, if any, that the
rights of Seller Parties with respect to such claim are actually prejudiced.
Unless the Stockholder has previously received written notice from Buyer,
Stockholder shall promptly notify Buyer of the existence of any Seller Contest
within ten (10) Business Days from the receipt by Seller Parties of any
written notice of such Seller Contest. The notices described in this paragraph
shall contain factual information (to the extent known) describing the
asserted Tax liability and shall include copies of the relevant portion of any
notice or other document 

received from any Governmental Authority or any other Person in respect of any
such asserted Tax liability.

(ii)Stockholder shall have the right to control, through counsel of its own
choosing and expense, the conduct of any Seller Contest, including those that
relate to any Acquired Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or of the China
Asset Seller. The Buyer Parties shall have the right to participate in (but
not control) any Seller Contest at their own expense if such Seller Contest
reasonably could be expected to result in (A) a Tax liability for any Buyer
Party or any Acquired Company, or (B) otherwise adversely affect any Buyer
Party, any Acquired Company or the Business, in each case, for any taxable
year (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date. The Stockholder
shall not settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of any Seller Contest
in a manner that adversely affects the Tax liability of any Buyer Party, any
Acquired Company or the Business for any taxable year (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date without the prior written consent of Buyer
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). If
Stockholder elects not to control the conduct of any Seller Contest, (x)
Seller Parties shall fund any deposit or other payment of Tax that is required
in order for the Buyer Parties or their Affiliates to pursue such Seller
Contest; provided, however, that no such requirement shall apply if
Stockholder instructs Buyer not to pursue the Seller Contest and acknowledges
its obligation to indemnify the Buyer Parties for the asserted liability, and
(y) Buyer Parties may not settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of
such Seller Contest in a manner that adversely affects the Tax liability of
any Acquired Company or the Business for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or for the
pre-Closing portion of the Straddle Period without the prior written consent
of Stockholder (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

(iii)Buyer Parties shall have the right to control, in their sole discretion,
the conduct of any Contest that is not a Seller Contest.

(h)If, upon a full or partial conclusion, settlement or other disposition of a
Seller Contest, a Taxing Authority assesses Taxes that are indemnifiable by
the Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement, (A) Buyer shall provide the
Stockholder a written notice setting forth the amount of such Tax assessment
(to the extent the Stockholder has not otherwise received such information),
(B) the Stockholder shall, within fifteen (15) Business Days of its receipt of
Buyer's written notice under (A) (or of the day it receives such information),
pay such Taxes either to the Taxing Authority directly (and furnish Buyer with
written proof of payment) or to Buyer in accordance with the payment and
distribution method reasonably acceptable to Buyer, and (C) the limitations
and other provisions set forth in Article IX (other than Section 9.04 and
Section 9.05) shall otherwise apply to such Tax claims.

(i)Section 336/338 Tax Elections. The Stockholder and Buyer agree that no
Party shall be permitted to make an election, if permitted, under either Code
Section 336(e) or 338(h)(10) (or any corresponding election under state, local
or non-U.S. Law) in respect of the Transaction.

Section 6.14 Employee Matters. 

(a)Effective as of the Closing Date, the China Asset Seller will terminate the
employment of each individual who is employed by the China Asset Seller in
connection with the Business (including each such employee who is not actively
at work on account of illness, disability or leave of absence) and who is
listed on Schedule 6.14(a) hereto (the "Transferring China Employees") and the
China Asset Buyer will enter into a written employment agreement with each
Transferring China Employee. For the avoidance of doubt, except for the
Assumed Liabilities and all liabilities accrued for or counted as a current
liability in the calculation of Working Capital, the China Asset Seller shall
be solely responsible for any and all liabilities in relation to the
Transferring China Employees that arise or relate to the period on or prior to
the Closing Date, including any such liability incurred in connection with the
termination of the employment of such Transferring China Employees and/or the
transfer of such Transferring China Employees' employment. Accordingly, on the
Closing Date, the China Asset Seller shall pay to each Transferring China
Employee an annual leave compensation for the accrued paid annual leave time
that was earned but unused by such Transferring China Employee prior to the
Closing Date in accordance with applicable Chinese Law. Such employment shall
be consistent with the terms of any collective labor agreement applicable to
any of the Transferring China Employees and shall be on terms and conditions
not less favorable than those in effect for such Transferring China Employees
immediately prior to the Closing. With respect to Transferring China
Employees, the China Asset Buyer shall give full credit for the term of
employment with the China Asset Seller and for all purposes (and, for the
avoidance of doubt), each such Transferring China Employee's years of service
with the China Asset Seller will be merged with and into such Transferring
China Employee's years of service with the China Asset Buyer for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit levels, including, without limitation, for
the purpose of calculation of severance pay where necessary (but not in a way
that gives past service credit for benefit accrual purposes for (i) the Long-
Term Retention Award plan or (ii) any non-statutory plan adopted by the Buyer
Parties following the Closing). Transferring China Employees, all of the
employees of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing (including each employee
who is not actively at work on account of illness, disability or leave of
absence), and Cristian Landoni (solely to the extent that Mr. Landoni resigns
his employment with the Stockholder immediately prior to the Closing) shall
collectively be referred to as the "Acquired Employees".

(b)For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending no earlier than the
twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Buyer Parties shall
(and shall cause their respective Affiliates, including the Acquired Companies
to) take all action necessary so that each Acquired Employee shall receive
base wages or salary, bonus opportunity, and Benefit Programs, all of the
foregoing considered in the aggregate (a "Compensation Package") that is
comparable to the Compensation Package received by similarly situated
employees of the Buyer Parties and their Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies) at the time; provided, however, that the Buyer Parties shall cause
SPG to maintain the Annual Incentive Plan for SPG (cash bonus) (as referred to
in Schedule 4.18) for the 2018 performance (calendar) year; and further
provided that, with respect to any Acquired Employee whose employment is
terminated by any Buyer Party or any Acquired Company on or prior to the
twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Buyer 

Parties shall (or shall cause their respective Affiliates, including the
Acquired Companies to) provide such Acquired Employee with severance benefits
on terms and conditions that are no less favorable than (A) those severance
benefits available to such Acquired Employee under the Acquired Company Plans,
or (B) those severance benefits available to similarly situated employees of
the Buyer Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, whichever is more
favorable.

(c)Each Buyer Party shall (and shall cause its respective Affiliates,
including the Acquired Companies to):

(i)credit Acquired Employees with all service credited to such Acquired
Employees as of the Closing Date in addition to service earned with any Buyer
Party or any Acquired Company after the Closing Date for purposes of
eligibility and vesting and, solely with respect to the amount of any
vacation, sick days, severance, layoff and similar benefits, levels of
accruals of benefits under Benefit Programs;

(ii)use commercially reasonable efforts to waive any pre-existing condition
exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements, actively at work
requirements or waiting periods for participation and coverage applicable
under Benefit Programs with respect to Acquired Employees and their
dependents; and

(iii)use commercially reasonable efforts to credit Acquired Employees with any
amounts paid under a plan maintained by any Seller Party (or any of their
respective Affiliates, including any Acquired Company) prior to the Closing
Date for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, coinsurance or out-
of-pocket requirements for the plan year that includes the Closing Date as if
such amounts had been paid under a corresponding Benefit Program.

(d)Each Buyer Party shall (and shall cause its respective Affiliates,
including the Acquired Companies to) provide, honor and recognize all accrued
but unused vacation (excluding any annual leave compensation paid pursuant to
Section 6.14(a)) with respect to Acquired Employees as of the Closing Date.

(e)As of the Closing Date, each Acquired Company shall terminate its
participation in each Plan that is not an Acquired Company Plan and each
Acquired Employee shall cease to participate in any Plan, and in no event
shall any Acquired Employee be entitled to accrue any benefits under such
Plans with respect to services rendered or compensation paid on or after the
Closing Date. The Seller Party that sponsors or maintains each such Plan shall
retain all liabilities and obligations under such Plan. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 6.14(e), the Acquired Employees shall
continue to participate in the Seller Party's U.S. medical and health plans to
the extent provided and on the terms set forth in the Transition Services
Agreement.

(f)Seller Parties and all appropriate Buyer Parties shall take commercially
reasonable efforts to permit Acquired Employees to make rollover contributions
of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31)
of the Code) of the account balance (including in the case of loans, rollovers
of notes in-kind) distributable to Acquired Employees from the 401(k) plan of
the Seller Party in which they participate, to a Section 401(k) defined
contribution plan of a Buyer Party. Seller Parties 

shall cause an Acquired Company to pay to each Acquired Employee in cash in a
lump sum on or before the Closing Date an amount equal to the amount of such
Acquired Employee's accrued Profit Sharing Contribution under the Seller
Party's 401(k) plan for the period through May 31, 2018, as taxable
compensation.

(g)Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, (i) the Parties
do not intend for this Agreement to, and this Agreement shall not, amend any
Plans or arrangements or create any rights or obligations except between the
Parties, (ii) this Section 6.14 is not intended to create any rights in any
Person who is not a party to this Agreement, and no Acquired Employee or other
current or former employee of the Acquired Companies or the Business
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) or any other Person not a
party to this Agreement shall be entitled to assert any claim hereunder, and
(iii) nothing in this Agreement shall create any obligation on the part of any
Buyer Party or any of their respective Affiliates to continue the employment
of any Acquired Employee with any Acquired Company or any Buyer Party for any
definite period following the Closing Date.

(h)Seller Parties shall cause SPG to pay to Timothy Johnson in cash in a lump
sum on or before the Closing Date a bonus in an amount equal to the amount (i)
of the severance due to Mr. Johnson in connection with termination of his
employment as further set forth in the Employment Agreement with Mr. Johnson
referenced on Schedule 4.14(a)(vii) plus (ii) the amount accrued with respect
to Mr. Johnson under the SPG Annual Incentive Plan (cash bonus) through the
latest payroll cutoff date prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything else
herein, the parties agree that the Stockholder shall bear full economic
responsibility for any payment to be made to Timothy Johnson arising from his
termination of employment.

Section 6.15 Acquired Company Names.

(a)Not later than twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, the Buyer
Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) to: (i) cease using the names SAES and SAES Pure Gas in
all respects; (ii) amend or terminate any certificate of assumed name or
"doing business as" filing so to eliminate its right to use, and all
references to, SAES and SAES Pure Gas, and (iii) amend the articles or
certificate of incorporation of SAES Pure Gas, Inc. to change the name therein
to a name not including or confusingly similar to SAES.

(b)Prior to the Closing (and in connection with the Pre-Closing
Restructuring), the Stockholder shall amend the articles or certificate of
incorporation of SUSA to change the name therein to a name that is mutually
agreeable to the Stockholder and the Buyer that does not include the same SAES
or any name confusingly similar thereto.

Section 6.16 Director and Officer Indemnification.

(a)For six (6) years after the Closing Date, the Buyer Parties shall cause the
Acquired Companies to indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of
expenses to, all past and present directors, officers and employees of the
Acquired Companies to the same extent such Persons are indemnified or have the
right to advancement of expenses as of the Closing Date by the Acquired
Companies pursuant to the Acquired Companies' 

certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational documents)
in existence on the Closing Date with, or for the benefit of, any such
directors, officers and employees for acts or omissions occurring on or prior
to the Closing Date.

(b)In the event of a liquidation or dissolution of one or more of the Acquired
Companies, or in the event that all or substantially all of the assets or all
of the shares of capital stock of one or more of the Acquired Companies are
sold, whether in one transaction or a series of transactions, then Buyer will
ensure that the successors and assigns of such Acquired Companies (including
the parent company of any Acquired Company in the event of a liquidation or
dissolution) assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.16.

(c)Notwithstanding Section 10.07, the provisions of this Section 6.16 are
intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her Representatives and are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other right to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

Section 6.17 Records. Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.13(d), with
respect to the financial books and records and minute books of the Acquired
Companies and the Business (or otherwise relating to the Purchased Assets or
Assumed Liabilities) relating to matters on or prior to the Closing Date, to
the extent the originals of such books and records have actually been
transferred and delivered to the Buyer Parties: (a) for a period of seven (7)
years after the Closing Date, the Buyer Parties shall not cause or permit
their destruction or disposal without first offering to surrender them to the
Stockholder; and (b) where there is a legitimate purpose, including an audit,
assessment or reassessment of the Stockholder or any Affiliate thereof by the
IRS or any other Taxing Authority or Governmental Authority, or any Proceeding
involving the Stockholder or any Affiliate thereof or a claim or dispute
relating to this Agreement, the Buyer Parties shall (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, including the Acquired Companies to) allow the
Stockholder and its Affiliates and Representatives reasonable access to such
books and records during regular business hours. Without limiting the
foregoing, following the Closing the Buyer Parties and their respective
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Acquired Companies) shall
provide the Stockholder and its Affiliates and Representatives with all
financial, accounting and corporate information of, or relating to, the
Acquired Companies or the Business reasonably required by the Stockholder
(including, without limitation, granting to the Stockholder, its Affiliates
and Representatives indirect access to Hyperion Financial Management (HFM)
system) in order to allow the Stockholder to complete its 2018 consolidated
financial statements (quarterly, semiannual and annual) that include the
Acquired Companies (up to and until the Closing Date) and have the same
audited. To the extent the originals of such books and records have not been
transferred and delivered to the Buyer Parties: (a) for a period of seven (7)
years after the Closing Date, the Seller Parties shall not cause or permit
their destruction or disposal without first offering to surrender them to the
Buyer Parties; and (b) where there is a legitimate purpose, including an
audit, assessment or reassessment of the Buyer Parties or any Affiliate
thereof by the IRS or any other Taxing Authority or Governmental Authority, or
any Proceeding involving the Buyer Parties or any Affiliate thereof or a claim
or dispute relating to this Agreement, the 

Seller Parties shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to) allow
the Buyer Parties and their Affiliates and Representatives reasonable access
to such books and records during regular business hours. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 6.17, nothing herein shall
require (x) any Party to provide information that is privileged if the
disclosure is reasonably expected to result in the loss of such privilege and
(y) any Seller Party to provide any Buyer Party (or any Affiliate thereof)
with any information, documents or records that do not primarily relate to the
Business. Any information obtained under this Section 6.17 and Section 6.13(d)
shall be kept confidential, except (i) as may be otherwise necessary in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in
conducting an audit or other proceeding or defending any Tax claim, (ii) with
the consent of Seller Parties or Buyer Parties, as the case may be or (iii) to
the extent contemplated in subclause (A), (B) or (C) of Section 6.12(a)(iv).

Section 6.18 Intellectual Property Matters.

(a)As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, the Seller
Parties shall, and shall cause their applicable Affiliates to reasonably
cooperate with the Buyer Parties: (i) in preparing and obtaining all documents
(including assignment forms) with the United States Patent and Trademark
Office or other corresponding Governmental Authority, as necessary to record
one of the Buyer Parties is the sole legal and record owner of the Acquired
Intellectual Property (such documents, the "IP Documents"); (ii) filing all IP
Documents; and (iii) to deliver to the Buyer all prosecution files and
dockets, registration certificates and litigation files to the extent relating
to the Acquired Intellectual Property, in each case, solely to the extent such
materials are in the possession of the Seller Parties and not already in the
possession of a Buyer Party (including an Acquired Company). The costs and
expenses (including filing fees) associated with the activities and actions
described in this Section 6.18(a) shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by the
Seller Parties and fifty percent (50%) by the Buyer Parties.

(b)As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, the Stockholder
shall, and shall cause the Seller Parties to, deliver to one of the Buyer
Parties all tangible embodiments of Company IP reasonably in the possession of
a Seller Party that was not (i) otherwise delivered at Closing or (ii) in the
possession of one of the Acquired Companies.

Section 6.19 Special VAT Invoice. The China Asset Seller shall issue valid
value-added tax ("China VAT") special invoices to the China Asset Buyer with
respect to the China Closing Date Payment and the Deferred China Asset
Purchase Price (which shall be paid in accordance with Section 6.22 hereof and
the Local China Purchase Agreement) in accordance with PRC Law (the "China VAT
Invoices"). China Asset Buyer shall pay an additional amount of cash to the
China Asset Seller equal to the total China VAT reflected on the China VAT
Invoices for payment to the appropriate PRC Taxing Authorities by the China
Asset Seller.

Section 6.20 Employee Separation Notification. Buyer Parties shall promptly
notify Stockholder of the separation from service (within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code) from the Buyer Parties and their Affiliates of any
of the following employees of the Acquired Companies: Paul Menigoz and Paul
Scherle. 

Section 6.21 Agreements Concerning Bonus Payments. In accordance with Section
2.02(b)(iii), at the Closing, Buyer Parties shall transfer to the payroll
account of SPG or, solely with respect to the Transferring China Employees,
the China Asset Buyer an amount equal to that portion of the Bonus Payments
(and related payroll Taxes) set forth in written instructions that will be
delivered by the Stockholder not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing. Thereafter, the Buyer Parties shall cause SPG or the China Asset
Buyer, as applicable, to remit and pay such amounts to the employees of SPG,
the applicable Transferring China Employees and the relevant Taxing
Authorities entitled thereto pursuant to written instructions delivered by the
Stockholder to the Buyer Parties within thirty (30) days following the Closing
Date. Buyer Parties shall cause SPG or the China Asset Buyer, as applicable,
to pay the amounts set forth in such instructions on the next regularly
scheduled payroll date of SPG or the China Asset Buyer reasonably following
delivery of such instructions and cause SPG or the China Asset Buyer to remit
any payroll Taxes required to be withheld from such Bonus Payments in
accordance with applicable Laws. Any such portion of the Bonus Payments (and
related payroll Taxes) for which instructions are not delivered by Stockholder
within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date shall be paid to the
Stockholder, in one (1) lump-sum payment by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, promptly thereafter. The Stockholder shall indemnify, defend
and hold the Buyer Parties and their respective Affiliates harmless from and
against any and all Losses arising out of, resulting from or relating to any
payments or remittances made or not made pursuant to (i) this Section 6.21 or
(ii) any instructions delivered by Stockholder as described in this Section
6.21, except to the extent any such additional Losses other than Taxes result
from the negligent or willful failure of the Buyer Parties to properly
withhold, remit or report the amount of any applicable Taxes with respect to
any Bonus Payments.

Section 6.22 Increase of China Asset Buyer's Registered Capital; Payment of
Deferred Portion of China Asset Purchase Price.

(a)Each of the Buyer Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
complete, as promptly as practicable following the Closing, the filing,
registration and other formalities with the competent commerce authority and
market regulation authority in the PRC (the "China Regulatory Authorities") as
are reasonably necessary and required in order to increase the China Asset
Buyer's registered capital for the purpose of funding the Deferred China Asset
Purchase Price in accordance with the Local China Purchase Agreement (such
increase to capital, the "China Capital Infusion"). Buyer shall provide the
Stockholder with regular updates concerning the efforts to complete the China
Capital Infusion as promptly as practicable following the Closing (including,
without limitation, by providing the Stockholder with written notice within
forty-eight (48) hours of the occurrence of any fact, event change,
circumstance or development that would or would be reasonably expected to (i)
negatively impact the ability of Buyer to complete the China Capital Infusion
or (ii) delay in any material respect the completion of the China Capital
Infusion).

(b)Once Buyer has received the requisite consents and/or permissions from the
China Regulatory Authorities to complete the China Capital Infusion, Buyer
shall promptly provide copies of the same to the Stockholder for review and
consideration. If the Stockholder finds such consents and/or permissions to be
acceptable and in order, the Stockholder shall return to Buyer (by wire
transfer of immediately available U.S. funds) the 

amount of the Deferred China Asset Purchase Price within five (5) Business
Days after the Stockholder's receipt of such consents and/or permissions.
Thereafter, Buyer and the China Asset Buyer will complete the China Capital
Infusion and the China Asset Buyer shall pay to the China Asset Seller the
amount of the Deferred China Asset Purchase Price in accordance with the terms
of the Local China Purchase Agreement. The China Capital Infusion and payment
of the Deferred China Asset Purchase Price by the China Asset Buyer must be
completed within ten (10) Business Days following Buyer's receipt of the
returned funds from the Stockholder.

(c)Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the China Capital Infusion
and the payment of the Deferred China Asset Purchase Price by the China Asset
Buyer to the China Asset Seller has not occurred, for any reason, on or before
the seventy-fifth (75th) calendar day following the Closing, the Stockholder
may (in its sole and exclusive election) either: (i) continue to hold the
amount of the Deferred China Asset Purchase Price in anticipation of the
completion of the China Capital Infusion (in which event the provisions of
Section 6.22(b) above shall continue to apply until such time as the
Stockholder elects to proceed under clause (ii) of this Section 6.22(c), which
the Stockholder may elect to do at any time thereafter); or (ii) retain the
full amount of the Deferred China Asset Purchase Price (in which event the
obligation of the China Asset Buyer under the Local China Purchase Agreement
with respect to the payment of the China Asset Purchase Price shall be deemed
to have been fully satisfied); provided that in the event that (x) each of the
Buyer Parties is in full compliance with the provisions set forth in this
Section 6.22 and (y) the Stockholder does not return to Buyer the amount of
the Deferred China Asset Purchase Price within 125 days following the Closing,
then the Stockholder will have been automatically deemed to have made the
election under clause (ii) above. In the event that the Stockholder elects to
retain the full amount of the Deferred China Asset Purchase Price pursuant to
this Section 6.22(c), either (A) the Parties shall amend the Local China
Purchase Agreement to reduce the China Asset Purchase Price to an amount equal
to the China Closing Date Payment made by the China Asset Buyer at Closing,
and such amended China Asset Purchase Price shall apply for all purposes under
this Agreement (and the Deferred China Asset Purchase Price will be allocated
to Buyer's acquisition of the Acquired Companies) or (B) if the China Asset
Purchase Price is not amended, the Deferred China Asset Purchase Price for all
purposes under applicable Law (including U.S. federal income tax purposes),
shall be treated as a payment from the China Asset Buyer to the China Asset
Seller as a portion of the purchase price for the Purchased Assets, unless
such treatment is contrary to applicable Law, and the Stockholder shall bear
and pay all China VAT incurred in connection with the Deferred China Asset
Purchase Price.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned at any time prior
to the Closing:

(a)by mutual written consent of the Buyer Parties and the Stockholder; 

(b)by the Buyer Parties or the Stockholder, if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before July 21, 2018 or such other date that the Buyer Parties
and the Stockholder may agree upon in writing (the "Termination Date");
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.02, (B) cannot be or has not
been cured prior to the earlier of (x) the Termination Date and (y) 15 days
following delivery of written notice of such breach or failure to perform and
(C) has not been waived by the Buyer Parties; or

The Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01
(other than Section 8.01(a)) shall give prompt written notice of such
termination to the other Parties setting forth a brief description of the
basis on which it is terminating this Agreement.

Section 8.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 7.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become

part of any Party except (a) for the provisions of Section 6.09, and Section
10.01 \- Section 10.11 and this Section 8.02 and (b) that nothing in this
Section 8.02 shall relieve any Party from liability for any material breach of
the covenants set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination or for
actual fraud.

shall be indemnified against until fully and finally resolved, irrespective of
whether the Party asserting such claim has initiated any Proceeding or
otherwise taken any further action in connection with the matters constituting
the basis for such claim.

Section 9.02 Indemnification of Buyer Parties. The Stockholder shall
indemnify, defend and hold the Buyer Parties and their respective directors,
shareholders, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, successors and
permitted assigns harmless from and against any and all Losses arising out of,
resulting from or relating to (a) any breach or non-fulfillment of any

warranties of the Buyer Parties contained in Article V, (c) any Assumed

Stockholder of Sections 4.10, 6.01(b)(xiv), 6.01(b)(xx) or 6.13 of this
Agreement for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or pre-Closing portion of a Straddle
Period).

Section 9.04 Procedure.

(a)A Person seeking indemnification hereunder (other than in respect of a
Contest to which Section 6.13 applies) (an "Indemnified Party") shall give a
written notice (a "Notice of Claim") specifying the facts constituting the
basis for its claim, and the applicable provision(s) of this Agreement upon
which the Indemnified Party relies for its demand and a good faith estimate of
the amount of the claim, to the Person(s) from whom indemnification is sought
hereunder (an "Indemnifying Party"); provided, however, that any such Notice
of Claim need only specify such information to the knowledge of the
Indemnified Party as of the date of such Notice of Claim and shall not limit
or prejudice any of the rights or remedies of any Indemnified Party on the
basis of any limitations on the information included in such Notice of Claim,
including any such limitations made in good faith to preserve the
attorney‑client privilege, work product doctrine or any other privilege. If
the claim is not a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty
(30) calendar days after delivery of the Notice of Claim to notify the
Indemnified Party in writing of the nature and basis of its objection, if any,
to the asserted claim for indemnification. If no such objection is received by
the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of the
Notice of Claim, the claim shall be deemed to be allowed. If an objection is
received by the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) calendar days after
delivery of the Notice of Claim, the Parties shall resolve the dispute in
accordance with Section 9.05.

(b)If an Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification because of a claim
asserted by any claimant other than an Indemnified Party, the Indemnified
Party shall deliver a Notice of Claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly after
such assertion is actually known to the Indemnified Party; provided, however,
that the right of a Person to be indemnified hereunder in respect of claims
made or alleged by any such claimant (a "Third Party Claim") (1) shall not be
adversely affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and then only to
the extent that, an Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby, and
(2) shall not be deemed time-barred or otherwise unavailable until at least
thirty (30) days have passed following such Indemnified Party's receipt of any
notice regarding the Proceeding giving rise to such Third Party Claim (and any
statute of limitations or common law principle that limits or purports to
limit the availability of such right to indemnification shall be deemed
tolled, to the extent necessary, until such thirty (30) day period has ended).

(c)The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party, to assume and conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim
with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense; provided
that: (i) the Third Party Claim solely seeks (and continues to solely seek)
monetary damages in an amount not reasonably expected to exceed any limitation
on the amount of Losses for which the Indemnifying Party is responsible
hereunder; and (ii) no conflict of interest arises that, under applicable
principles of legal ethics, in the judgment of counsel to the Indemnified
Party, would prohibit a single counsel from representing both the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such Third
Party Claim. The Indemnified Party may thereafter 

participate in (but not control) the defense of any such Third Party Claim
with its own counsel at its own expense; provided, however, that if (A) any of
the conditions described in clauses (i) or (ii) above fails to occur or ceases
to be satisfied or (B) the Indemnifying Party fails to take reasonable steps
necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim in the reasonable
judgment of the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Party may assume its
own defense, and the Indemnifying Party will be liable for all reasonable
costs or expenses paid or incurred (including advancement thereof) in
connection with such defense (subject to the limitations set forth herein).

(d)If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Third Party Claim, or fails to notify the Indemnified Party of
such election within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of the Notice of
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its option, to assume
and control defense of the matter in such manner as it may deem reasonably
appropriate, and the Indemnifying Party will be liable for all reasonable
costs or expenses paid or incurred (including advancement thereof) in
connection with such defense (subject to the limitations set forth herein).

(e)The Indemnifying Party, if it has assumed the defense of any Third Party
Claim as provided in this Agreement, may not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), consent to a settlement of, or the entry of
any judgment arising from, any such Third Party Claim that (A) does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the
plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a complete release from all liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim, (B) imposes any liability or obligation on
the Indemnified Party that will not be fully indemnified by the Indemnifying
Party pursuant hereto, (C) involves a finding or admission of any wrongdoing
on the part of the Indemnified Party or (D) otherwise grants any injunctive or
equitable relief. The Indemnified Party shall not have the right to settle any
Third Party Claim, the defense of which has not been assumed by the
Indemnifying Party or which is otherwise being defended by the Indemnified
Party in accordance with the terms of this Section 9.04(e), without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(f)Each of the Parties shall, and shall cause their Affiliates (and their
respective Representatives) to, make available to the other(s) all relevant
information in his, her or its possession relating to any such Third Party
Claim which is being defended by the other Party and shall otherwise
reasonably cooperate in the defense thereof. The Indemnified Party or
Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, that is controlling such defense shall
keep the other Party reasonably advised of the status of such Proceeding and
the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith (but shall not be bound
to implement or adopt) any recommendations made by the other Party with
respect thereto. The Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to the rights and
claims of the Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses paid by the
Indemnifying Party under this Article IX.

(g)Tax Claims. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
this ýSection 9.04 shall not apply to the conduct of a Contest (and related
claims in connection therewith), which shall be governed exclusively by
Section 6.13. 

Section 9.05 Determination of Claims; Payment. A claim for indemnification
under this Article IX shall be deemed finally determined upon the occurrence
of any of the following: (a) it is deemed allowed under Section 9.04(a); (b)
entry of any final judgment or award rendered by a court of competent
jurisdiction and the expiration of time in which to appeal therefrom; (c) full
execution of a settlement of a Third Party Claim in the manner and in
accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 9.04(b); or (d) the
execution by the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party of a mutually
binding settlement agreement with respect to a claim. The Indemnifying Party
shall be required to pay all of the sums so owing in respect of such finally
determined claim to the Indemnified Party by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Indemnified Party within ten
(10) Business Days after such final determination.

Section 9.06 Limitations on Indemnification.

(a)Except to the extent set forth in Section 9.06(c)(ii), the Stockholder
shall not be required to provide indemnification for claims made under Section
9.02(b) unless the Indemnified Party's Losses for all such claim(s) shall
exceed an amount equal to one-half percent (0.5%) of the Net Proceeds, as
finally determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.03 hereof,
in the aggregate and then only to the extent that the Losses exceed an amount
equal to one-half percent (0.5%) of the Net Proceeds, as finally determined in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.03 hereof (it being the intent of
the Parties that the foregoing be in the nature of a deductible) (the
"Deductible"); provided, however, that the Deductible shall not apply to any
Losses arising out of, resulting from or relating to any inaccuracy in,
misrepresentation of, or breach of the representations and warranties
contained in Sections 4.01 (Organization, Qualification and Power), 4.02
(Authorization; Enforceability), 4.04 (Capitalization), 4.05 (No Brokers),
4.07(a) (Absence of Encumbrances), or 4.10 (Taxes).

(b)Except to the extent set forth in Section 9.06(c)(ii), in no event shall
the aggregate liability of the Stockholder with respect to all claims of
indemnification made under Section 9.02(b), exceed an amount equal to twelve
and one-half percent (12.5%) of the Net Proceeds, as finally determined in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.03 hereof, in the aggregate (the
"Cap"); provided, however, that the Cap shall not apply to any Losses arising
out of, resulting from or relating to (i) any inaccuracy in, misrepresentation
of, or breach of the representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.01
(Organization, Qualification and Power), 4.02 (Authorization; Enforceability),
4.04 (Capitalization), 4.05 (No Brokers), 4.07(a) (Absence of Encumbrances),
4.10 (Taxes), or 4.21 (China Purchased Assets) or (ii) Pre-Closing Taxes.

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

(i)in no event shall the maximum liability of the Stockholder under this
Article IX exceed the amount of the Net Proceeds;

(ii)the limitations set forth in Section 9.06(a), (b) and (c)(i) above shall
not apply in the event that the Stockholder or any of its Affiliates or, with
respect to 

its activities prior to the Effective Time, any Acquired Company, is found to
have committed fraud.

(iii)the Stockholder shall not be obligated to indemnify for Losses under this
Article IX to the extent that such Losses were (A) accrued for or counted as a
liability in the calculation of the Final Closing Working Capital or (B)
otherwise reflected in the Settlement Amounts or an adjustment to the Net
Proceeds in the manner contemplated in Section 2.03 hereof.

(d)For purposes of calculating the amount of Losses relating to a breach of
any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement (but not, for
clarity, for purposes of determining whether a breach of any such
representation or warranty has occurred for the purpose of Section 9.02
hereof), any qualification as to materiality or any other similar
qualification or standard contained in Article IV of this Agreement shall be
disregarded (it being understood that the word "Material" in the defined term
"Material Contracts" and the qualification as to "Material Adverse Effect" in
Section 4.12 shall not be disregarded for any purpose).

Section 9.07 Reductions for Insurance Proceeds and Other Recoveries.

(a)The amount that any Indemnifying Party is or may be required to pay to any
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article IX shall be reduced (retroactively
or prospectively) to the extent of any insurance proceeds actually received by
such Indemnified Party (net of deductibles or similar costs) in respect of
such claim. The existence of a claim by an Indemnified Party for monies from
an insurer or against a third party in respect of any Losses shall not,
however, delay any payment pursuant to the indemnification provisions
contained herein and otherwise determined to be due and owing by an
Indemnifying Party. Rather, the Indemnifying Party shall make payment in full
of the amount determined to be due and owing by it against an assignment by
the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party of the entire claim of the
Indemnified Party for the insurance proceeds or against such third party.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, it is the intention of
the Parties that no insurer or any other third party shall be (i) entitled to
a benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the foregoing
indemnification provisions, or (ii) relieved of the responsibility to pay any
claims for which it is obligated. If an Indemnified Party has received the
payment required by this Agreement from an Indemnifying Party in respect of
any Losses and later receives insurance proceeds or other amounts in respect
of such Losses, then such Indemnified Party shall hold such insurance proceeds
or other amounts in trust for the benefit of the Indemnifying Party and shall
pay to the Indemnifying Party, as promptly as practicable after receipt, a sum
equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds or other amounts received, up
to the aggregate amount of any payments received from the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Agreement in respect of such Losses (or, if there is more
than one Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall pay each Indemnifying
Party its proportionate share (based on payments received from the
Indemnifying Parties of such insurance proceeds)).

(b)Any calculation of Losses for purposes of this Article IX shall be reduced
to take account of any net Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified
Party as a result of any such Losses in the taxable year in which the
indemnity payment is made 

in respect of the relevant claim. Any payment hereunder shall initially be
made without regard to this Section 9.07(b) and shall be reduced to reflect
any such net Tax benefit only after the Indemnified Party has actually
realized such benefit. For purposes of this Agreement, the Indemnified Party
shall be deemed to have "actually realized" a net Tax benefit to the extent
that, and at such time as, the amount of Taxes required to be paid by the
Indemnified Party is reduced below the amount of Taxes that it would have been
required to pay but for deductibility of such Losses (treating any Tax items
attributable to such Losses as the last items claimed for any taxable period).
The amount of any reduction hereunder shall be adjusted to reflect any final
determination with respect to the Indemnified Party's liability for Taxes.

Section 9.08 Duty to Mitigate. Each Party agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses which form the basis for any claim
under this Article IX; provided that the Indemnified Party shall not be
obligated to make an insurance claim on its own policies if such claim would
reasonably result in an increase in premiums.

Section 9.09 Sole and Exclusive Remedy. The remedies provided in this Article
IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties and their
respective officers, directors, employees, Affiliates, agents,
Representatives, successors and assigns for any and all Losses arising out of,
relating to, or resulting from, any breach of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and any other
agreement, instrument or document executed and delivered in connection
herewith, or otherwise relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that nothing herein is intended to waive or
otherwise limit any claims for Losses arising out of, relating to, or
resulting from fraud, or waive any equitable remedies to which a Party may be
entitled.

Section 10.10 Jurisdiction; Venue, Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a)Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for

Closing, the Acquired Companies) (each, a "Releasing Buyer Person"), hereby

Companies, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities; provided, however,
that the Parties acknowledge and agree that this ýSection 10.12 does not apply
to and shall not constitute a release of any rights or obligations to the
extent arising from or under (i) commercial receivables and payables to third
parties, (ii) this Agreement, (iii) any of the Transaction Documents, or (iv)
any certificate or other instrument delivered by or on behalf of either Party
pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 10.13 Disclaimer of Warranties. The Stockholder makes no
representations or warranties with respect to any projections, forecasts or
forward-looking information provided to any Buyer Party or any of their
respective Affiliates. EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THIS
AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OR ANY CERTIFICATE DELIVERED
HEREUNDER OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, THE SELLER
PARTIES ARE SELLING THE BUSINESS, THE PURCHASED ASSETS AND THE SUSA SHARES, IN
EACH CASE, ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS AND THE SELLER PARTIES DISCLAIM ALL
OTHER 

WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND GUARANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND
THE SELLER PARTIES MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR
FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NO IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER.
Except as specifically referenced in this Agreement, any Transaction Documents
or any certificate delivered hereunder or in the Disclosure Schedules, the
Buyer Parties acknowledge that neither the Stockholder, nor any of its
Representatives or Affiliates or any other Person, has made any representation
or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any
diligence materials heretofore made available by the Stockholder or any of its
Representatives or Affiliates to the Buyer Parties, and neither the
Stockholder nor any of its Representatives or Affiliates or any other Person
will have or be subject to any liability to any Buyer Party, any Affiliate of
any Buyer Party or any other Person resulting from the distribution of any
such information to, or use of any such information by, any Buyer Party, any
Affiliate of any Buyer Party or any of their respective agents, consultants,
accountants, counsel or other Representatives, except any information provided
by the Seller Parties, the Acquired Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates, employees or Representatives constituting fraud.

Section 10.14 Certain Matters Regarding Representation of Acquired Companies
and the Stockholder.

(a)The internal general counsel's office of the Stockholder, in concert with
certain outside counsel, including Nixon Peabody LLP (such general counsel's
office and outside counsel, collectively, "Sellers' Counsel"), has acted as
counsel for the Stockholder and its Affiliates, including the Acquired
Companies (the "Clients") for various matters prior to the Closing, including
in connection with this Agreement, Transaction Documents and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (the "Pre-Closing Engagements") and not as
counsel for any other Person, including any Buyer Party or any of their
respective Affiliates. Only the Clients shall be considered clients of
Sellers' Counsel in the Pre-Closing Engagements. Accordingly, notwithstanding
that the Clients are or were clients in the Pre-Closing Engagements, upon and
after the Closing, all communications between any of the Clients and Sellers'
Counsel in the course of the Pre-Closing Engagements shall be deemed to be
attorney‑client confidences that belong solely to the Stockholder and not to
any Buyer Party or any of their respective Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Acquired Companies), in each case so long as such communications
would be subject to a privilege or protection if they were being requested in
a Proceeding by an unrelated third party. The Buyer Parties and their
respective Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies)
shall not have access to any such communications, or to the files of Sellers'
Counsel relating to the Pre-Closing Engagements. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, notwithstanding that the Acquired Companies are
or were clients of Sellers' Counsel in the Pre-Closing Engagements, upon and
after the Closing (except with respect to any communications that would not be
subject to a privilege or protection if they were being requested in a
Proceeding by an unrelated third party), (i) the Stockholder and its
Affiliates shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect to the Pre-Closing Engagements, and none of the Acquired Companies,
the Buyer Parties or any of their respective Affiliates shall be a holder
thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of Sellers' 

Counsel in respect of the Pre-Closing Engagements constitute property of the
Clients (including any Acquired Company), only the Stockholder and its
Affiliates (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Acquired Company) shall
hold such property rights, and (iii) Sellers' Counsel shall have no duty
whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or
files to any Acquired Company, any Buyer Party or any of their respective
Affiliates by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Sellers'
Counsel and any Acquired Company or otherwise.

(b)Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Parties recognize
that it would be impracticable to try to purge all Client-privileged
communications from the Acquired Companies' files and computer systems prior
to the Closing, and so the Parties agree that no waiver is intended by leaving
such documents where they are and the Buyer Parties and their respective
Affiliates shall not be permitted to review any such documents, and the Buyer
Parties agree that they and their respective Affiliates shall not be permitted
to use any such documents in a manner adverse to the Stockholder in any
indemnity or other dispute following the Closing.
