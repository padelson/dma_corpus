Virginia Sub Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the
provisions of Article 4 and (ii) a check representing the amount of any cash
in lieu of fractional shares that such holder has the right to receive in
respect of the Company Virginia Sub Certificate or Company Virginia Sub
Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article 5\. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares or
on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of
Company Virginia Sub Certificates. 

  

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Ordinary Shares
in account entry form or receipts representing Parent ADSs shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Company Virginia Sub Certificate with respect
to the Parent Ordinary Shares in account entry form or receipts representing

surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the
Parent Ordinary Shares in account entry form or receipts representing Parent
ADSs issuable with respect to such Company Virginia Sub Certificate.

(d) If any receipt representing Parent ADSs or Parent Ordinary Shares in
account entry form are to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Company Virginia Sub Certificate or Company Virginia Sub
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Company Virginia Sub
Certificate or Company Virginia Sub Certificates so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a receipt
representing Parent ADSs or Parent Ordinary Shares in account entry form in
any name other than that of the registered holder of the Company Virginia Sub
Certificate or Company Virginia Sub Certificates surrendered, or required for
any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

(e) After the Exchange Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of Company Virginia Sub of the shares of Company
Virginia Sub Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Exchange Effective Time. If, after the Exchange Effective Time,
Company Virginia Sub Certificates are presented for transfer to the Exchange
Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for receipts representing Parent
ADSs or Parent Ordinary Shares in account entry form as provided in this
Article 5. 

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional Parent Ordinary Shares in
account entry form or receipts representing fractional Parent ADSs shall be
issued upon the surrender of Company Virginia Sub Certificates for exchange,
no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Ordinary Shares in account
entry form or receipts representing Parent ADSs shall be payable on or with
respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a holder of
Parent Ordinary Shares in account entry form or receipts representing
Parent ADSs. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent
shall deliver to the Exchange Agent the Parent Ordinary Shares being sold by
the Exchange Agent pursuant to the procedure described in Section 5.02(i). 

  

(g) The Exchange Agent shall sell any Parent ADSs delivered to it by the
Depositary and any non-cash portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
unclaimed by the stockholders of Company Virginia Sub on the date falling 18
months after the Exchange Effective Time and shall return the proceeds of
such sale and any other cash held in the Exchange Fund at such time to Company
Virginia Sub. Any former shareholders of Company Virginia Sub who have not
theretofore complied with this Article 5 shall thereafter look only to
Company Virginia Sub with respect to the Share Consideration, any
consideration in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends
and distributions on the Parent Ordinary Shares in account entry form or
receipts representing Parent ADSs deliverable in respect of each share of
Company Virginia Sub Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Company Virginia
Sub, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any
former holder of shares of Company Virginia Sub Common Stock for any amount
delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(h) In the event any Company Virginia Sub Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Company Virginia Sub Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine
is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Company Virginia Sub Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Virginia Sub Certificate the Share Consideration and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement. 

  

(i) The Exchange Agent shall aggregate all fractional interests in Parent
Ordinary Shares and sell all such shares, in one or more transactions
executed on one or more stock exchanges through one or more brokers nominated
by Parent with the proceeds of such sale being remitted to the Exchange Agent
as soon as practicable thereafter. The Exchange Agent shall deliver the
cash proceeds of any such sales to former holders of shares of Company
Virginia Sub Common Stock in lieu of their fractional interest in Parent
Ordinary Shares or Parent ADSs. The proceeds to any holder of shares of
Company Virginia Sub Common Stock sold by the Exchange Agent pursuant to this
Section 5.02(i) shall be the proceeds before any costs associated with any
such sale, and any costs incurred in connection with any such sale (including
any commissions, currency exchange fees, transfer taxes and other transaction
costs) shall be borne by Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, any reference in
this Agreement to Parent providing to the Exchange Agent any funds in lieu
of fractional shares shall refer exclusively to the procedure described in
this Section 5.02(i), through which cash is generated through the sale by the
Exchange Agent of Parent Ordinary Shares, and through which no cash is
provided or funded by Parent at any time. 

  

 _Section 5.03_ _. Withholding Rights._ Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under any provision of Tax law. If Parent so
withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which Parent made
such deduction and withholding _._

(b) The Company has taken all action necessary to render the provisions of
Articles 11 and 16 of the Charter inapplicable to, or otherwise consistent

or making it more difficult to obtain the approval of the Company Board or
the shareholders of the Company than it would be in the absence of such
provision.

pursuant to the terms of the Rights Agreement inapplicable to the Voting

restructured, modified or extended. Neither the Company nor the Bank has been
notified that principal and interest with respect to any such loan or other

originated, underwritten, approved, documented and periodically approved in
all material respects in accordance with prudent lending standards generally
accepted in the banking business and, to the Knowledge of the Company, after

Companys policies and procedures, and (b) is the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its
terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and other
laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and
to general equity principles (except as enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to the affecting
creditors rights or by general equity principles). Each extension of credit
made by the Bank to an "insider" (as such term is defined in the Federal
Reserve Boards Regulation O) of the Bank or the Company complies with the
Federal Reserve Boards Regulation O, as made applicable to the Bank by 12
C.F.R. § 563.43. 

  

 _Section 6.32_ _. Anti-money Laundering and Customer Information Security._
Neither the Company nor the Bank is aware of, has been advised of, or has
reason to believe that any facts or circumstances exist, which would cause
the Bank (a) to be deemed to be operating in violation in any respect of the
federal Bank Secrecy Act, as amended, and its implementing regulations
(31 C.F.R. Part 103), the USA Patriot Act of 2001, Public Law 107-56 (the

abitrator, that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

    ##### 

  

    

(b) _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding Section 8.03(a), at any time prior to
the Reincorporation Effective Time,: 

   

(i) following receipt of an unsolicited _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal that
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with financial
and legal advisors, constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in, a
Superior Proposal, the Company, directly or indirectly through advisors,
agents or other Representatives, may furnish nonpublic information to, or
enter into discussions with, any Third Party in connection with such
Acquisition Proposal by such Third Party if and only to the extent that (A)
the Company is not then in breach of its obligations under this Section 8.03
and (B) prior to furnishing such nonpublic information to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, such Third Party, the Company Board
receives from such Third Party an executed confidentiality
agreement containing confidentiality and stand still provisions that are not
less restrictive on such Third Party than the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ that all such information (to the extent that such information has
not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made
available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such
Third Party); and 

   

(ii) the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change, but only
following receipt of a Superior Proposal; 

   

 _provided_ that, in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and
(ii) the Company Board may take such action only if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
such action is required by its fiduciary duties under Pennsylvania Law, and,
_provided, further_ , that, solely in the case of the foregoing clause (ii),
the Board may not make such Adverse Recommendation Change unless (A) the
Company promptly notifies Parent in writing at least ten Business Days
before taking such action of its intention to do so, attaching (if such
Adverse Recommendation Change is in response to a receipt of a Superior
Proposal) the most current version of the proposed agreement under which such
Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the Third
Party making the Acquisition Proposal, and (B) Parent does not propose,
within 10 days after its receipt of such written notification,
proposed modifications to this Agreement or the terms of the Transaction or
otherwise provide information to the Company that in the aggregate result in
the transactions contemplated hereunder being at least as favorable to the
stockholders of the Company (other than Parent) as such Superior Proposal (or
description thereof). 

   

    ##### 

  

  

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company Board from
complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal, so long as any action taken or statement made to so comply is
consistent with this Section 8.03 ( _provided_ that any such action taken or
statement made that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board reaffirms the
Company Recommendation in such statement or in connection with such
action). 

  

(c) _Required Notices_. The Company Board shall not take any of the actions
referred to in Section 8.03(b) unless the Company shall have delivered to
Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such
action. In addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no
event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of
its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, any indication that a
Third Party is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or any request for
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access
to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that may be considering making, or has
made, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide such notice orally
and in writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the terms and
conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, and
shall promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to
Parent copies of all correspondence and written materials sent or provided to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that describe any terms or conditions
of any Acquisition Proposal (as well as written summaries of any oral
communications addressing such matters). After the notification provided
for in the preceding sentence, the Company shall thereafter provide Parent,
as promptly as practicable, with oral and written notice setting forth all
such information as is reasonably necessary to keep Parent informed in all
material respects of the status and details (including material amendments or
proposed material amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry and shall promptly provide to Parent a copy of all written materials
subsequently provided in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request
or inquiry. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed
to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of the Companys compliance with
this Section 8.03(c). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) _Definition of Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Superior Proposal" means a _bona fide_ , unsolicited written 100%
Acquisition Proposal on terms that the Company Board determines in good
faith, after considering the advice of a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and outside legal counsel and taking into account all
terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including, the value
offered to the Companys shareholders, any break-up fees, expense
reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation, any financing or
capital provided or to be provided by such Third Party and the certainty that
the Acquisition Proposal will be consummated, are more favorable than the
Reincorporation Merger and the Share Exchange to the constituencies and
Persons the Company Board is required to consider under the Charter and
permitted to consider under Applicable Law, in each case in the exercise of
its fiduciary duties. 

  

(e) _Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions, Etc._ The Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease
immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its
Representatives conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly request that each Third
Party, if any, that has executed a confidentiality agreement within the
24-month period prior to the date hereof in connection with its consideration
of any Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and all analyses and other
materials prepared by or on behalf of such Person that contains, reflects or
analyzes that information), and the Company shall provide to Parent all
certifications of such return or destruction from such other Persons as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to secure all such certifications as promptly as
practicable. If any such Person fails to provide any required certification
within the time period allotted in the relevant confidentiality agreement (or
if no such period is specified, then within a reasonable time period after
the date hereof), then the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
secure its rights and ensure the performance of such other partys
obligations thereunder as promptly as practicable.

    ##### 

  

  

 _Section 8.05_ _. Litigation._ Without otherwise limiting or altering any
rights that Parent or its Affiliates may have, the Company shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate at Parents expense in the defense or
settlement of any actual or threatened litigation against the Company and/or
its directors relating to this Agreement, the Transaction or the other
transactions contemplated hereunder, including the Reincorporation Merger or
the Share Exchange, and shall not agree to any such settlement without
Parents written consent. 

  

 _Section 8.06_ _. Company Virginia Sub Shareholder Vote._ Promptly following
the organization of Company Virginia Sub, the Company, as the sole
shareholder of Company Virginia Sub, will approve the Reincorporation Merger
and the Share Exchange and waive any right to dissent from the
Reincorporation Merger and the Share Exchange for all purposes of Section
13.1-729 et seq. of the VSCA such that the provisions of such sections will
not apply to this Agreement, the Transaction or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby and Section 13.1-725 et seq. and Section 13.1-728.1 et
seq. will not apply thereto. 

  

 _Section 8.07_ _. Joinder Agreement._ Promptly following the date hereof,
the Company shall form Company Virginia Sub as a Virginia corporation under
and in accordance with the VSCA, and the Company shall cause Company Virginia
Sub to, and Company Virginia Sub shall, sign a joinder agreement to this
Agreement and be bound hereunder. 

  

 _Section 8.08_ _. Structure of the Transaction._ Parent may at any time
change the method of effecting the Transaction if and to the extent requested
by Parent and consented to by the Company (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld); _provided_ , however, that no such change shall (i)
alter or change the amount or kind of the Share Consideration provided for in
this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Transaction
with respect to the Companys or Company Virginia Subs stockholders or (iii)
materially impede or delay, or make less likely, the consummation of the
Transaction.

ARTICLE 9 
 Covenants of Parent 

   

Parent agrees that: 

  

 _Section 9.01_. _Director and Officer Liability_. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the
following: 

  

(a) For six years after the Exchange Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, indemnify, defend
and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each person who is
now or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to
the Exchange Effective Time, an officer or a director of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, including Company Virginia Sub (each, an
"Indemnified Person") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses,
liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based
in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that
such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts
or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Exchange Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Exchange Effective Time to
the same extent such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement
of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the
Charter, the Company Bylaws and indemnification agreements listed on Section
9.01(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, if any, in existence on the date
hereof with any directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries. 

  

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to continue in full force and
effect for a period of six years from the Exchange Effective Time the
provisions in existence in the Charter and bylaws in effect on the date of
this Agreement regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses. 

  

(c) For six years after the Exchange Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall provide officers and directors liability insurance in respect of acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Exchange Effective Time covering each
Indemnified Person currently covered by the Companys officers and
directors liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and
amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date
hereof ( _provided_ , that the Company may elect to purchase a six-year
prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to Parent
providing substantially equivalent benefits to the Indemnified Persons)
(in each case, to the extent commercially available); _provided_ that, in
satisfying its obligation under this Section 9.01(c), the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to pay in the aggregate in excess of 300%
of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year, which
amount is set forth in Section 9.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule;
and _provided further_ that, if the aggregate premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Exchange Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 9.01. 

  

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 9.01 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the Charter or bylaws of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under Pennsylvania Law or any other
Applicable Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of
the Share Exchange and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by,
each Indemnified Person. 

  

 _Section 9.02_. _Employee Matters_. (a) For a period of one year following
the Exchange Effective Time, Parent shall provide to all employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Exchange Effective Time who
continue employment with the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates
("Continuing Employees") base salary or base wages and benefits (other than
equity-based compensation) that are in the aggregate substantially comparable
to such salary or wages and benefits provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Exchange Effective Time. 

  

(b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation, in which any Continuing Employee becomes a
participant, such Continuing Employee shall receive full credit (for purposes
of eligibility to participate, vesting, and benefit level with respect to
vacation entitlement, severance benefits and other paid time off) for service
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the
extent the Company provides such past service credit) to the same extent that
such service was recognized as of the Effective Date under a comparable plan
of the Company and its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employee
participated. 

  

(c) Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employees (and their eligible
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Exchange
Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable plan of
the Company and its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employee
participated. If a Continuing Employee commences participation in any
health benefit plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries after the
commencement of a calendar year, to the extent commercially practicable,
Parent shall cause such plan to recognize the dollar amount of all co-
payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by such Continuing
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during such calendar year for
purposes of satisfying such calendar years deductible and co-payment
limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing
Employee (and dependents) commences participation. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) Following the Exchange Effective Time, Parent shall, cause the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Affiliates to pay, in the ordinary course of
business consistent with prior practice, to all employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries who participated in the short  term incentive bonus plans
of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries in 2008 ("Company Employees") all short
term bonuses for the 2008 calendar year, with the amounts of such bonuses
determined at the target level established for each Company Employee (with
all corporate performance goals for 2008 deemed satisfied at the target
levels). 

  

(e) The parties hereto agree that, with respect to any Employee Plan providing
for payments or benefits upon or following the occurrence of a "change in
control" (as defined in the applicable Employee Plan), the Transaction shall
be deemed to constitute a Buyer Acquisition Transaction (as defined in the
Investment Agreement) as contemplated in Sections 8.06, 8.07 and 8.08 and/or
Section 8.10 of the Investment Agreement. 

  

(f) Nothing in this Section 9.02 shall (i) be treated as an amendment of, or
undertaking to amend, any benefit plan, (ii) prohibit Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, from amending any employee
benefit plan or (iii) confer any rights or benefits on any person other than
the parties to this Agreement. 

  

 _Section 9.03_ _. Santander Shares._ Parent hereby agrees to vote or
exercise its right to consent with respect to all Shares beneficially owned
as of the date prior to the date of this Agreement by it at the time of any
vote or action by written consent to approve and adopt this Agreement, the
Reincorporation Merger and the Transaction at any meeting and at any
adjournment thereof at which this Agreement and other related transactions in

of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any

(c) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the parties shall cooperate with
each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly
prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications,
notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable the
Parent Requisite Regulatory Approvals and the Company Requisite
Regulatory Approvals and all other permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to comply with the terms and
conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
such third parties, Regulatory Agencies or Governmental Authorities. The
Company and Parent shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the
extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject
to Applicable Laws relating to the confidentiality of information, all the
information relating to the Company on one hand, or Parent, on the other, as
the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appear in
any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the
other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require Parent or the
Company to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any
condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental Authorities,
that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect (measured
on a scale relative to the Company) on any of Parent, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation (a "Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition"). In
addition, the Company and Parent agree to cooperate and use their reasonable
best efforts to assist each other in preparing and filing such petitions and
filings, and in obtaining such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of third parties and Governmental Authorities, that may be
necessary or advisable to effect any mergers and/or consolidations of
Subsidiaries of the Company and Parent following consummation of the
Transaction. 

  

(d) If at any time prior to the Exchange Effective Time any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Proxy
Statement, Schedule 13E-3 or the F-4, so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent
required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the Company shareholders. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(e) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly advise the other upon
receiving any communication from any Regulatory Agency or Governmental
Authority consent or approval of which is required for consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe
(i) that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Parent Requisite Regulatory
Approval or any Company Requisite Regulatory Approval, respectively, will not
be obtained, (ii) that the receipt of any such approval may be materially
delayed, or (iii) that any such regulatory approval may be subject to a
Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition. 

  

(f) The Company shall cooperate with such reasonable requests as may be made
by Parent with respect to any post-Closing reorganization of Parents and the
Companys Subsidiaries, including filing prior to the Closing such
applications with Regulatory Agencies or Governmental Authorities as may be
necessary or desirable in connection with any such reorganization. 

  

(g) Prior to the Exchange Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Parent
Ordinary Shares and Parent ADSs that will be issued in the Share Exchange to

meeting of its shareholders to be held as soon as reasonably practicable for
the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval required in
connection with this Reincorporation Merger, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such meeting to occur as soon as reasonably practicable.
Subject to the provisions of Section 8.03(b), the Company Board shall
maintain the Company Board Recommendation until such meeting of shareholders.
The Company Board shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the
shareholders of the Company the Company Shareholder Approval. The Company
agrees that, notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change or otherwise,
it shall submit this Agreement to its shareholders at a shareholder meeting
in accordance with the first sentence of this paragraph. Parent and the
Company agree that the first record date established by the Company Board for
such shareholder meeting shall be established with the approval and
consent of at least one director serving on the Company Board at the
designation of Parent (the "Record Date"). The Company agrees that any change
to the Record Date that would establish a new record date that is prior to 90
days following the Record Date will also require the approval and consent of
at least one director serving on the Company Board at the designation of
Parent. 

  

(b) Following receipt of the necessary report of the auditor designated by the
Commercial Registry relating to the abolishment of the preemptive rights of
holders of Parent Ordinary Shares, Parent shall call and hold a meeting of
the holders of Parent Ordinary Shares to be held for the purpose of obtaining
the Parent Shareholder Approval. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain from the holders of Parent Ordinary Shares the Parent Shareholder
Approval. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

 _Section 10.03_. _Public Announcements_. Parent and its Affiliates, on the
one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall

public statement, or scheduling any press conference or conference call with
investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and, except as may be required by Applicable
Law or any listing agreement with or rule of any national securities
exchange, shall not issue any such press release or make any such other
public statement or schedule any such press conference or conference call
before such consultation. 

  

 _Section 10.04_. _Further Assurances_. At and after the Exchange Effective
Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be

Company Virginia Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection with, the Reincorporation Merger and the
Share Exchange.

their boards of directors shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreement may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein
and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Takeover
Statute on the transactions contemplated hereby. Any Adverse Recommendation
Change shall not change the approval of the Company Board for purposes
eliminating the application of any Takeover Statue or Defensive Measure to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 _Section 10.07_ _. Exemption From Liability Under Section _ _16(b)_ _._
Prior to the Exchange Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall each take

action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York State
court sitting in New York City, so long as one of such courts shall have
subject matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and that
any cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have
arisen from a transaction of business in the State of New York, and each of
the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts
(and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action
or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of
any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 13.01
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

 _Section 13.10_. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY. 

  

 _Section 13.11_. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto
shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other
parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof
signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no
party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any
other oral or written agreement or other communication). 

  

 _Section 13.12_. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement. 

  

 _Section 13.13_. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

  

 _Section 13.14_. _Specific Performance._ The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof in any federal court located in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York State court
sitting in New York City, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.
