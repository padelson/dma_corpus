Each party has agreed to take certain actions with respect to such Governmental Filings and
Consents including without limitation the covenants of the Seller Entities and the Buyer set forth
in Sections&nbsp;6.1 and 9.1, respectively. In the event the conditions to the obligations of the
parties set forth in Sections&nbsp;10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 hereof are otherwise satisfied or waived and the

Buyer, the Seller Entities and Parent (the &#147;<U>Supplemental Confidentiality Agreement</U>&#148;), the
Seller Entities have disclosed to Buyer&#146;s Permitted Representatives (as defined in the Supplemental
Confidentiality Agreement) all required revenue information of the undertakings on the side of the
Seller Entities as such terms are used or defined in the draft and, as applicable, final
regulations of the Anti-Monopoly Authority (as defined herein) in order to determine whether a PRC
Anti-Monopoly Filing is required (the &#147;<U>Revenues Information</U>&#148;). The Seller Entities hereby

recognized certified public accounting firm independent of both the Seller Entities and the Buyer

Entities as to the resolution of the disputed items and the resulting calculation of the Closing
Statement and Working Capital. The Closing Statement as determined by the Accountants shall be
deemed the &#147;<U>Final Closing Statement</U>&#148; and shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties
and shall not be subject to dispute or review. Each of the parties shall have the right to approve
the fees for engagement of such Accountant. The fees and expenses of the Accountants in connection
with the resolution of disputes pursuant to this Section&nbsp;3.3(b) shall be borne one-half (1/2) by
Buyer and one-half (1/2) by the Seller Entities.

Accountants (as defined herein), of and relating to the Business for the fiscal years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2007 and December&nbsp;31, 2008 and any subsequent interim period, solely to the extent
required to be filed by Buyer with the SEC pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K (or any

Accountants in connection with this audit of the Historical Financial Information. To the extent
that the Audit Accountants are no longer registered and in good standing with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board, are not permitted by applicable Law to render an audit opinion in

form) not less than seventy one (71)&nbsp;calendar days after the initial filing of such Current Report
on Form 8-K (or any successor form), which initial filing, if required, must be filed by Buyer with
the SEC not less than four (4)&nbsp;days (as calculated under the SEC&#146;s rules and regulations) after the
Closing Date. Accordingly, time is of the essence with respect to the observance of this covenant.

execution and filing of an accountant&#146;s consent. The Seller Entities covenant and agree to

procedure. The mediation will be held in Chicago, Illinois. The mediation will be conducted by a
single mediator. The mediation will take place within thirty (30)&nbsp;calendar days of the appointment
of a mediator. Within five (5)&nbsp;calendar days of the submission of a written demand for mediation
by either party, the parties will exchange lists of three (3)&nbsp;proposed mediators. The parties will
have five (5)&nbsp;calendar days to make any good faith objection to any of the proposed mediators. The
resulting list of proposed mediators will be submitted to the ICDR and, within five (5)&nbsp;business
days, the ICDR will appoint one of the proposed mediators. Upon the lapse of the thirty (30)&nbsp;days
or if such dispute arises out of Buyer&#146;s failure to timely pay the Termination Fee to the Seller

disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to, or in connection with this
Agreement or any other agreement executed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement or the
negotiation, validity or performance hereof and thereof or the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby that are not resolved by mutual agreement shall be resolved solely and exclusively by
binding arbitration to be conducted before the ICDR or its successor. The arbitration shall be
held in Chicago, Illinois before a single arbitrator and shall be conducted in accordance with the
rules and regulations promulgated by the ICDR unless specifically modified herein. Within five (5)
business days of the submission of a written demand for arbitration, each party may submit the
names of three (3)&nbsp;proposed arbitrators to the ICDR. Within five (5)&nbsp;business days of receiving
the names of each party&#146;s proposed arbitrators, the ICDR shall send simultaneously to each party to
the dispute an identical list of ten (10)&nbsp;names of persons to be chosen as an arbitrator for the
dispute. This list shall include the six (6)&nbsp;arbitrator names provided by the parties, and four
(4)&nbsp;names chosen by the ICDR. Each party shall have five (5)&nbsp;business days from the transmittal
date in which to strike up to four (4)&nbsp;names objected to, number the remaining names in order of
preference, and return the list to the ICDR. From among the persons who have been approved on both
lists, and in accordance with the designated order of mutual preference to the extent possible, the
ICDR will appoint one of the proposed arbitrators within five (5)&nbsp;business days of receipt of the
ranked list from the parties. The arbitrator shall apply the substantive laws of the State of
Delaware without regard to conflicts of laws principles. The interpretation and enforcement of
this Section, and any order or award entered hereunder, shall be governed by the Federal
Arbitration Act, without reference to the Delaware Uniform Arbitration Act.

right, and the arbitrator may in his or her discretion allow additional depositions upon good cause
shown by the moving party. However, the arbitrator shall not have the power to order the answering
of interrogatories or the response to requests for admission. In connection with any arbitration,
each party shall provide to the other, no later than fifteen (15)&nbsp;days before the date of the
arbitration, the identity of all persons that may testify at the arbitration and a copy of all
documents that may be introduced at the arbitration, considered by the arbitrator, or used by a
party&#146;s witness, or used or considered by any expert. The arbitrator&#146;s decision and award shall be

compensatory damages and shall not multiply actual damages or award punitive damages or any other
damages that are specifically excluded under this Agreement, and each party hereby irrevocably
waives any claim to such damages. The arbitrator, however, is authorized to award declaratory
relief, regardless of whether the request for declaratory relief involves an actual use or
controversy. The arbitrator shall, upon a finding that it is impracticable to meet one or more of
the deadlines set forth in this Section consistent with his or her primary obligation justly to
determine the controversy before him or her in a timely and reasonable manner, have discretion to
alter such deadlines.

that they will share equally the fees and expenses of the International Centre for Dispute
Resolution and that they will each bear their own attorneys&#146; fees and expenses, except as otherwise
provided herein. The arbitrator may in his or her discretion assess costs and expenses (including
the reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and expenses of the prevailing party) against any party to a
proceeding. Any party unsuccessfully refusing to comply with an order of the arbitrators shall be
liable for costs and expenses, including attorneys&#146; fees, incurred by the other party in enforcing
the award. This Section&nbsp;14.13 applies equally to requests for temporary, preliminary or permanent
injunctive relief, except that in the case of temporary or preliminary injunctive relief any party
may proceed in court without prior arbitration for the limited purpose of avoiding immediate and
irreparable harm.

this agreement to arbitrate and confirmation or enforcement of any award rendered by the
arbitrator, and the parties waive any objection to the venue, personal jurisdiction, or convenience
as a forum of these courts for such purpose. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and
binding on the parties and enforceable in accordance with the New York Convention on the
Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards.
