 (a) The parties hereto agree that certain Governmental Filings and Consents (as defined herein) set forth on _Schedule 8.2_ hereto are or, subject to Section 2.8(b) hereof, may be necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party has agreed to take certain actions with respect to such Governmental Filings and Consents including without limitation the covenants of the Seller Entities and the Buyer set forth in Sections 6.1 and 9.1, respectively. In the event the conditions to the obligations of the parties set forth in Sections 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 hereof are otherwise satisfied or waived and the filings set forth on _Schedule 8.2_ have been made if required by applicable Law, the Buyer may request that the Seller Entities consummate the transactions contemplated at the Closing;  _provided,_ _however_ , that to the extent such transactions require the consent or approval of the Governmental Authority (as defined below) in the jurisdiction where the filings set forth on _Schedule 8.2_ hereof have been made, the Buyer and Seller Entities shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated at the Closing to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, with the payment contemplated by Section 3.1(a) to be pro rated based upon revenues, and any portion of such transactions that may not be completed at such date shall be completed upon receipt of such consent or approval as is required under applicable Law. The parties acknowledge and agree that the foregoing may require certain amendments to the Ancillary Agreements to permit the Seller Entities to continue to operate the Manufacturing Capability as and to the extent set forth in this Agreement in any such jurisdiction. 

  

 (b) In addition to and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties hereby agree as follows: 

  

 (i) Subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement dated December 5, 2008 by and among Buyer, the Seller Entities and Parent (the " _Supplemental Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the Seller Entities have disclosed to Buyers Permitted Representatives (as defined in the Supplemental Confidentiality Agreement) all required revenue information of the undertakings on the side of the Seller Entities as such terms are used or defined in the draft and, as applicable, final regulations of the Anti-Monopoly Authority (as defined herein) in order to determine whether a PRC Anti-Monopoly Filing is required (the " _Revenues Information_ "). The Seller Entities hereby represent and warrant that such Revenues Information is accurate, complete and correct, for the sole purpose of determining whether Buyer, its Affiliates and/or the Seller Entities have any obligation to make a merger and acquisition filing under the PRC Anti-Monopoly Law, effective August 1, 2008 (a " _PRC Anti-Monopoly Filing_ "), with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the PRC Acquisition Agreements. 

  

 (ii) The parties agree that neither party shall pursue a preliminary consultation or seek guidance with the PRC Ministry of Commerce or any other designated anti-monopoly enforcement authority (" _Anti-Monopoly Authority_ ") to determine whether a filing with the PRC Anti-Monopoly Authority is necessary or advisable without the prior consent of the other party. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (iii) Based upon the Revenues Information and interpretations of draft and final regulations of the Anti-Monopoly Authority available as of the date of this Agreement, the parties have determined as of the date of this Agreement that the Revenues Information in the PRC do not exceed the filing threshold for a PRC Anti-Monopoly Filing and that, as a result, Buyer, its Affiliates and/or the Seller Entities are not required to make such a PRC Anti-Monopoly Filing with the PRC Anti-Monopoly Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the PRC Acquisition Agreements. The parties will jointly revisit this determination if the PRC Anti-Monopoly Authority issues any formal or draft guidance, policy statement, interpretation, notice or regulation prior to Closing which either party reasonably determines, based upon advice of its PRC anti-trust counsel, that the matters relied upon in making the determination as of the date of this Agreement were incorrect or incomplete and will meet and discuss such matters. In the event the parties revisit the foregoing determination and thereafter (x) the parties jointly determine that a PRC Anti-Monopoly Filing is required, the condition set forth in Section 10.3(a) shall be applicable and Buyer shall prepare such filing or (y) Buyer and the Seller Entities cannot reach agreement as to whether such a PRC Anti-Monopoly Filing is required, the parties shall meet (the " _Meeting Date_ ") and discuss in good faith an alternative plan to comply with the applicable law as updated in a manner consistent with the other terms of this Agreement and, if reasonably acceptable to Buyer and the Seller Entities, such alterative plan shall be implemented, and, if applicable, the condition set forth in Section 10.3(a) shall not be thereafter applicable. All dates for performance in this Agreement shall be delayed on a day-to-day basis, up to a maximum of thirty (30) days, following the Meeting Date until such time as an alternative plan is either mutually agreed or the parties conclude that no such agreement will be reached. If at any time (including after the Closing) such filing or additional information on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is requested by the Anti-Monopoly Authority, the Buyer shall notify the Seller Entities in writing. 

  

 (iv) In the event it is subsequently determined that a PRC Anti-Monopoly Filing is required as described in Section 2.8(b)(iii) hereof or if at any time (including after the Closing) such filing or additional information on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is requested by the Anti-Monopoly Authority, the Seller Entities will, and will cause their affiliates and representatives to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer in all respects relating to such filing, including, submitting to the Anti-Monopoly Authority such information, documents and certifications as may be required in connection with any such filing or investigation and the approval or resolution thereof, provided that Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make any such PRC Anti-Monopoly Filing within thirty (30) days following such determination, and providing such information, documents and certifications to the Permitted Representatives (subject to the terms of the Supplemental Confidentiality Agreement) or Buyer as may be reasonably requested or necessary in connection with the foregoing. 

  

 (v) In the event one or both of the PRC Acquisition Agreements have not been entered into prior to any such filing referred to in this Section 2.8(b), Buyer and the Seller Entities party thereto agree to promptly execute such PRC Acquisition Agreements following a determination by the Buyer that such a filing is required. 

   ##### 

  

  

 2.9 _PRC Acquisition Agreements_. The parties hereto agree to execute and deliver, and each of Parent and Buyer agree to cause their Affiliates party thereto to execute and deliver, the PRC Acquisition Agreements and to take all actions with respect thereto and necessary thereunder to so execute and deliver within five (5) business days of the date of this Agreement.

 (v) Buyer hereby unconditionally promises to pay all components of the Initial Payment set forth in Section 3.1(a) above.

Buyer acknowledges that the agreements to pay contained in this Section 3.1(a) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; accordingly, if Buyer fails promptly to pay the amounts due pursuant to Section 3.1(a) to the Seller Entities (as adjusted or otherwise modified pursuant to this Section 3 and, if applicable, the Letter Agreement), and, in order to obtain such payment, the Seller Entities commence an action to enforce its rights under this Section 3.1(a), Buyer shall pay to the Seller Entities their costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such action, together with interest on the amount due under this Section 3.1(a) as provided in Section 3.5 below.

 (ii) on the date that is thirty (30) months after the Closing Date (or the first business day thereafter) (the " _Second Subsequent Payment Date_ "), Buyer or Buyer Nominee(s) shall deliver to the Seller Entities an amount equal to 7.5% of the Purchase Price. The First Subsequent Payment Date and the Second Subsequent Payment Date are each referred to herein as a " _Subsequent Payment Date_." 

  

 (c) In the event that a portion of the Purchase Price is being paid in cash, Buyer or Buyer Nominee(s) shall deliver such cash to the Seller Entities by bank wire transfer pursuant to wiring instructions set forth in a written notice delivered to Buyer not less than five (5) business days prior to the date upon which any payment is due pursuant to Section 3.1(a) or 3.1(b).

 (d) On any date on which shares of Common Stock are to be issued, the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued shall be determined by dividing the value of the Common Stock to be issued by the Buyer by a price per share equal to the volume weighted average price (" _VWAP_ ") of the Common Stock during the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the date of issuance of such security (the " _Reference Price_ "). 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock being issued by the Buyer to the Seller Entities pursuant to this Section 3.1 shall not exceed such number of shares as would require Buyer to obtain shareholder approval for such issuance pursuant to the then-existing rules of any applicable stock exchange or automated quotation system on which any of the Buyers securities are then listed or quoted. In addition, the Buyer shall issue the Common Stock payable pursuant to this Section 3.1 to any Affiliate of the Seller Entities as the applicable Seller Entity shall direct in writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) such issuance complies with all applicable Laws, including all applicable foreign, federal and state securities laws; (ii) such issuance can be made without registration under applicable foreign, federal or state securities Laws; (iii) such issuance does not require any filing with any Governmental Authority pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 18a, and the implementing regulations thereunder, 16 C.F.R. Parts 801-803 (the " _HSR Act_ "); (iv) such party becomes a party hereto by execution of a Joinder Agreement in the form attached hereto to the extent of the Common Stock so issued to such party; and (v) such party is or becomes a party to the Amended and Restated Investor Rights Agreement dated as of the Closing Date by and among Buyer and the other parties thereto in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit D_ (the " _Amended and Restated Investor Rights Agreement_ "). 

  

 (f) For purposes of this Section 3.1: 

  

 (i) " _Purchase Price_ " shall mean the greater of (A) two (2) times Revenue or (B) eleven (11) times Pre-Tax Profit, in each case as calculated under United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") consistently applied and determined in accordance with paragraphs (ii) and (iii) below. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) " _Revenue_ " shall mean the revenue attributable to the Business of the Seller Entities for the 12-month period beginning on January 1, 2008 and ending on December 31, 2008 (the " _Purchase Price Determination Period_ ") and reflected on the Purchase Price Financial Statements (as such term is defined in Section 6.4(d)), as adjusted upward pursuant to the terms of that certain letter agreement dated August 11, 2008 by and between ACON Laboratories, Inc. and Buyer (the " _T1/T2 Letter Agreement_ "). "Revenue" shall in no event include any revenue earned under the Third Party Agreements or in the First Territory (as defined in the FTNF Acquisition Agreement). 

  

 (iii) " _Pre-Tax Profit_ " shall mean the pre-tax profit (including allocations of overhead and other items contained therein) attributable to the Business of the Seller Entities purchased at the Closing for the Purchase Price Determination Period and reflected on the Purchase Price Financial Statements, as adjusted upward pursuant to the terms of the T1/T2 Letter Agreement. "Pre-Tax Profit" shall in no event include any pre-tax profit (or allocations of overhead or other items contained therein) earned under the Third Party Agreements or in the First Territory. 

  

 (A) In determining the pre-tax profit applicable to the 2008 sales to First Territory customers into countries outside of the First Territory in excess of 2005 sales to First Territory customers into countries outside of the First Territory under the T1/T2 Letter Agreement, Buyers gross margin applicable to such excess sales in 2008 shall be reduced by an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the amount of such 2008 excess sales, and such reduced amount shall be added to the pre-tax profits of the Business to determine the Purchase Price. 

  

 (B) Pre-Tax Profit shall be determined excluding all costs and expenses of the Seller Entities incurred in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (i.e. the pre-tax profit will be adjusted upward as if such expenses had not been incurred). 

  

 (C) That certain letter agreement dated of even date herewith (the " _Letter Agreement_ ") sets forth matters the impact of which is or may not be finally determinable as of the date hereof. Such matters, once fully investigated by the parties, may result in an impact to the Purchase Price, including the timing of the payment thereof, because such items either reflect revenue that may not be sustainable by the Buyer or expenses that may be appropriately includible in determining Pre-Tax Profit, notwithstanding the fact that such matters may not be adjusted in preparing the Financial Statements or the Purchase Price Financial Statements. The parties hereto agree that the Letter Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement. 

  

 (iv) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge that the amounts due under Sections 3.1(a) and 3.1(b) cannot be calculated, and amounts cannot be paid, until such time as the Purchase Price Financial Statements are delivered to Buyer as required by Section 6.4(d) hereof and Buyer has a reasonable opportunity to review such financial statements. 

   ##### 

  

  

 3.2 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Buyer and the Seller Entities hereby agree on the allocation of the Purchase Price among the Transferred Assets pursuant to the methodology set forth on _Schedule 3.2_, which allocation shall be in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign law, as applicable; _provided_ that in the event of conflict with any such provisions such allocation shall be made in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code). Such allocation shall be binding upon Buyer and the Seller Entities for all Tax purposes and the parties shall file all Tax Returns (as defined herein) (including amended Tax Returns and claims for refund) and information reports, including IRS Form 8594, in a manner consistent with such allocations. 

  

 3.3 _Certain Adjustments_. 

  

 (a) _Final Purchase Price Statements Adjustment_. The Seller Entities shall deliver the financial statements contemplated by Section 6.4(d) within the time period set forth therein and, prior to the earlier to occur of the determination of the Purchase Price or the completion of the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008, the Buyer, the Seller Entities and, if requested by the Buyer, the Audit Accountants shall meet to consider the impact of the matters set forth in Section 3.1(f)(iii)(C) hereof (including the Letter Agreement) on the Purchase Price Financial Statements and the Purchase Price. On or prior to June 1, 2009, the Seller Entities shall deliver to Buyer the Purchase Price Financial Statements audited by Grant Thornton LLP or such other independent auditing firm as may be agreed upon between the parties (the " _Audit Accountants_ "), for purposes of calculating the adjustments described in this Section 3.3(a) (such audited financial statements, the " _Final Purchase Price Statements_ "). The Final Purchase Price Statements shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties. Without limiting the Seller Entities obligations to deliver the Final Purchase Price Statements by June 1, 2009, the dates set forth in Sections 3.1(a)(ii), 3.1(a)(iii) and 3.1(a)(iv) shall be extended for each day beyond June 1, 2009 that such Final Purchase Price Statements are delivered. In the event that the Purchase Price as determined by reference to the Final Purchase Price Statements is less than the Purchase Price as determined by reference to the Purchase Price Financial Statements, then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to reflect such decrease and the Seller Entities shall jointly and severally make such payment to Buyer in cash within five (5) days after the Final Purchase Price Statements are completed, and, if such payment is not made in full within such five-day period, such payment shall thereafter bear interest at a rate equal to ten percent (10%) per annum until paid in full. In the event that the Purchase Price as determined by reference to the Final Purchase Price Statements exceeds the Purchase Price as determined by reference to the Purchase Price Financial Statements, then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to reflect such increase and Buyer shall make such payment to the Seller Entities in cash within five (5) days after the Final Purchase Price Statements are completed, and, if such payment is not made in full within such five-day period, such payment shall thereafter bear interest at a rate equal to ten percent (10%) per annum until paid in full. The costs of the audit in connection with the preparation of the Final Purchase Price Statements shall be borne and paid one half (1/2) by the Seller Entities and one half (1/2) by Buyer. The Seller Entities shall provide reasonable access, upon reasonable prior written notice and during normal business hours, to such personnel, facilities, books, records and other information as the Audit Accountants may reasonably request to permit the Audit Accountants to perform and complete the foregoing audit of the Purchase Price Financial Statements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event payments remain to be made under Section 3.1(a) hereof, amounts due from the 

   ##### 

  

    

Seller Entities due to a reduction in the Purchase Price pursuant to this
Section 3.3(a) will offset such amounts, and amounts due to the Seller
Entities as a result of an increase in the Purchase Price pursuant to this
Section 3.3(a) will increase the amount owed. 

  

 (b) _Working Capital Adjustment_. The following sets forth the Working Capital calculations and methodology for adjustment that will occur following the Closing Date: 

  

 (i) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, with the assistance of the Seller Entities, prepare and deliver to the Seller Entities a statement calculating the Working Capital (as defined below), which statement will be prepared consistent with the Seller Entities past accounting methods and policies and otherwise in accordance with GAAP consistently applied (the " _Closing Statement_ "). Unless the Seller Entities deliver the Dispute Notice (as defined below) within thirty (30) days after receipt of a Closing Statement, such Closing Statement shall be deemed the " _Final Closing Statement_ ", shall be binding upon all parties and shall not be subject to dispute or review. If the Seller Entities disagree with the Closing Statement, the Seller Entities shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof, notify Buyer in writing (the " _Dispute Notice_ "), which Dispute Notice shall provide reasonable detail of the nature of each disputed item on the Closing Statement. The Seller Entities and Buyer shall first use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute among themselves and, if the parties are able to resolve such dispute, the Closing Statement shall be revised to the extent necessary to reflect such resolution, shall be deemed the " _Final Closing Statement_ " and shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties and shall not be subject to dispute or review. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after the Buyers receipt of the Dispute Notice, the parties shall submit the dispute to a mutually agreed upon internationally recognized certified public accounting firm independent of both the Seller Entities and the Buyer (the " _Accountants_ "). The Accountants shall act as experts and not arbiters and shall determine only those items in dispute on the Closing Statement. Promptly, but no later than thirty (30) days after engagement, the Accountants shall deliver a written report to Buyer and the Seller Entities as to the resolution of the disputed items and the resulting calculation of the Closing Statement and Working Capital. The Closing Statement as determined by the Accountants shall be deemed the " _Final Closing Statement_ " and shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties and shall not be subject to dispute or review. Each of the parties shall have the right to approve the fees for engagement of such Accountant. The fees and expenses of the Accountants in connection with the resolution of disputes pursuant to this Section 3.3(b) shall be borne one-half (1/2) by Buyer and one-half (1/2) by the Seller Entities. 

  

 (ii) The Purchase Price will be adjusted following the Closing as provided in this paragraph. If the amount of the Working Capital reflected on the Final Closing Statement is less than $5.85 million (the " _Target Working Capital Amount_ ") (such difference, the " _Working Capital Shortfall_ "), then the Seller Entities shall jointly and severally pay to Buyer an amount equal to the Working Capital Shortfall and as a result the Purchase Price shall be decreased by an amount equal to the Working Capital Shortfall. The Seller Entities shall make such payment to Buyer in cash within five (5) days after the Final Closing Statement is determined and, if such payment is not made in full within such five-day period, such payment shall thereafter bear interest at a rate equal to ten percent (10%) per annum until paid in full. If the amount of the Working Capital as reflected on the Final Closing Statement is equal to the 

   ##### 

  

    

applicable Target Working Capital Amount, then there will be no adjustment to
the Purchase Price. If the amount of the Working Capital reflected on the
Final Closing Statement is greater than the applicable Target Working Capital
Amount (such difference, the " _Working Capital Surplus_ "), then the Buyer
shall pay to the Seller Entities an amount equal to the Working Capital
Surplus and as a result the Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount
equal to the Working Capital Surplus. The Buyer shall make such payment to
the Seller Entities in cash within five (5) days after the Final Closing
Statement is determined and, if such payment is not made in full within such
five-day period, such payment shall thereafter bear interest at a rate equal
to ten percent (10%) per annum until paid in full. The Buyer and the Seller
Entities shall provide the other party with wire transfer instructions
necessary to permit the payments of amounts due pursuant to this Section 3.3
within the time required. 

  

 (iii) For purposes of the calculation of Working Capital Shortfall and Working Capital Surplus under this Agreement, " _Working Capital_ " means, with respect to the Seller Entities as of the close of business on the Closing Date and as determined in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, an amount equal to the sum of accounts receivable, notes receivable included in the Transferred Assets and prepayments included in the Transferred Assets, less accounts and other payables (except for those arising from purchases of finished goods inventory, goods in transit, raw materials or otherwise arising from or related to purchases of inventory, materials, components and the like) and accrued expenses of the Seller Entities, in each case, that constitute Assumed Liabilities determined in accordance with the methodology used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. 

  

 3.4 _Fractional Shares of Common Stock_. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued in connection with this Agreement, but in lieu thereof, if a Seller Entity would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of the Common Stock, then such Seller Entity shall receive cash in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Reference Price. 

  

 3.5 _Buyer Default_. Except for amounts due under Section 3.3 hereof, if Buyer defaults in making a payment under this Section 3 when due under the terms of this Agreement, then all such amounts not paid when due shall accrue interest at a rate of ten percent (10%) per annum; provided, that in the event the foregoing applies to any payment under Section 3.1(a)(ii), 3.1(a)(iii) or 3.1(a)(iv), such ten percent (10%) interest shall be due in lieu of, and not in addition to, the four percent (4%) interest set forth in such Section, and such four percent (4%) interest shall stop accruing as of such date that the ten percent (10%) interest shall begin accruing. The rights and remedies of the Seller Entities under this Section 3.5 are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges otherwise available to the Seller Entities. 

  

 _Section 4._ REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER ENTITIES. 

  

 As a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, the Seller Entities, hereby jointly and severally make to Buyer, the representations and warranties contained in this Section 4 as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date; _provided_ , that those representations and warranties which relate specifically to the Closing shall not be required to be made as of the date hereof.

 6.4 _Financial Statements and Information_. 

   

 (a) As and to the extent requested by Buyer, as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event prior to June 1, 2009, the Seller Entities shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to Buyer the historical financial information (including audited and, if applicable, unaudited financial information), including a manually signed accountants report from the Audit Accountants (as defined herein), of and relating to the Business for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2008 and any subsequent interim period, solely to the extent required to be filed by Buyer with the SEC pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K (or any successor form) as contemplated by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder together with an audit opinion thereon from the Audit Accountants in the form required by the SEC and applicable stock exchange (the " _Historical Financial Information_ "). Based on preliminary financial information provided to Buyer by the Seller Entities, Buyer has determined, as of the date of this Agreement, that (i) the relief contemplated by Section 9.8(a)(i) hereof will be required and (ii) audited financial information of and relating to the Business for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2008 (and, if applicable, unaudited financial information of and relating to the Business for any subsequent interim periods) will be required as the Historical Financial Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Final Purchase Price Statements shall be the final determinative financial information with respect to the Business for purposes of determining whether Historical Financial Information is required under this Section 6.4, as well as the nature of such Historical Financial Information. The Seller Entities covenant that the Historical Financial Information will be prepared in accordance with GAAP as of the dates and for the periods indicated. The Seller Entities will also cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Audit Accountants in connection with this audit of the Historical Financial Information. To the extent that the Audit Accountants are no longer registered and in good standing with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, are not permitted by applicable Law to render an audit opinion in connection with a filing by Buyer under the Exchange Act, or otherwise cannot or will not complete the audit for reasons separate and apart from the Seller Entities and the audit process contemplated hereby, the Seller Entities shall not be liable for any failure to satisfy this 

   ##### 

  

 

covenant solely due to the failure of the Audit Accountants to remain so
registered or so permitted, but instead shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with Buyer to find alternate means to satisfy delivery
of the Historical Financial Information as soon as reasonably practicable. To
the extent that any Governmental Authority (including the SEC) or stock
exchange requires any additional financial statements or financial
information or statements covering more than just the Business, whether
historical or pro forma in nature, the Seller Entities shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Buyer at Buyers sole expense with preparation
and presentation of such information as is required and shall provide such
access to financial information and personnel and cooperate with any
independent public accounting firm as is necessary to assist Buyer in
fulfilling such requirements. 

   

 (b) The Seller Entities will cooperate in all reasonable respects with Buyer in Buyers preparation of the pro forma financial information relating to the acquisition of the Business and related manufacturing operation at the Existing Facility solely to the extent required pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K (or any successor form) as contemplated by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Pro Forma Information_ ," and together with the Historical Financial Information, the " _Required Information_ "), including without limitation providing such financial and other information, records and documents relating to the Business and related manufacturing operation at the Existing Facility as may be necessary to prepare such Pro Forma Information, providing access to such of the Seller Entities personnel, advisors and accountants as may be necessary to prepare such Pro Forma Information, and generally cooperating with Buyers reasonable requests in order to facilitate such preparation. 

  

 (c) The parties further acknowledge that the Required Information (if any) must be filed by Buyer with the SEC under cover of an amendment to a Current Report on Form 8-K (or any successor form) not less than seventy one (71) calendar days after the initial filing of such Current Report on Form 8-K (or any successor form), which initial filing, if required, must be filed by Buyer with the SEC not less than four (4) days (as calculated under the SECs rules and regulations) after the Closing Date. Accordingly, time is of the essence with respect to the observance of this covenant.

 (i) _Selection of Potential Phase 1 Transferred Employees_. Promptly following the date hereof, the Seller Entities shall, and Parent and the Seller Entities shall cause Genclonn, if applicable, to, provide Buyer or its designee with access to (i) the Phase 1 Eligible Employees for purposes of interviewing each such Phase 1 Eligible Employee as Buyer or its designee may request, such interviews to occur at ACON Bios Existing Facility during such employees normal working hours unless otherwise agreed to by ACON Bio, and (ii) all employment records, including performance and compensation reviews and disciplinary records, of the Phase 1 Eligible Employees, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, such records to be made available to Buyer or its designee at ACON Bios Existing Facility. Within twenty (20) days following the first date of access to said Eligible Employees, Buyer shall provide to the Seller Entities a list of the Phase 1 Eligible Employees to whom it intends to offer, or cause its designees to offer, employment to with such employment to commence as of the Closing Date (the " _Potential Phase 1 Transferred Employees_ "). 

  

 (ii) _Selection of Potential Phase 2 Transferred Employees_. From time to time after the date hereof and continuing through the date that is sixty (60) days after the end of the term of the last Supply and Distribution Agreement, and in any event not less frequently than quarterly, the Buyer or its designee and the Seller Entities shall, and the Parent and the Seller Entities shall cause Genclonn to, meet to discuss the operational needs of the Buyer or its designee that must be met by hiring those Phase 2 Eligible Employees that it is interested in hiring and the needs of the Seller Entities in performing their obligations under the applicable Supply and Distribution Agreements. From time to time and at the reasonable request of Buyer or its designee following these discussions, with respect to those Phase 2 Eligible Employees that Buyer or its designee may consider hiring within the next sixty (60) days, the Seller Entities shall, and Parent and the Seller Entities shall cause Genclonn, if applicable, to, provide Buyer or its designee with access to (i) such Phase 2 Eligible Employees that Buyer or its designee may consider hiring within the next sixty (60) days for purposes of interviewing each such Phase 2 Eligible Employee as Buyer or its designee may request, such interviews to

_Potential Phase 2 Transferred Employee_ " and all Potential Phase 2
Transferred Employees identified by Buyer or its designees (which may occur
at different dates) collectively, the " _Potential Phase 2 Transferred
Employees_ " and, together with the Potential Phase 1 Transferred Employees,
the " _Potential Transferred Employees_ ") and the date or dates at which
such persons employment is expected to commence (each, a " _Subsequent
Transfer Date_ "), but in any event such date shall not be sooner than forty
(40) days following the date of delivery of such list (recognizing that the
Buyer and the Seller Entities may determine that different deadlines may be
appropriate on a case-by-case basis). 

  

 (c) _Offer of Employment_. 

  

 (i) _Offer of Phase 1 Employment_. Within thirty (30) days following the first date of access to the Phase 1 Eligible Employees in accordance with Section 6.7(b)(i), Buyer or its designee will offer employment to each Potential Phase 1 Transferred Employee who Buyer expects will commence employment with Buyer or its designee immediately after the Closing. The offers of employment to such Potential Phase 1 Transferred Employees contemplated by this Section 6.7(c) shall be made pursuant to a procedure mutually agreed upon by the Seller Entities and Buyer or its designee and shall be contingent upon the Closing and upon each such Potential Phase 1 Transferred Employee satisfying Buyers or its designees hiring requirements at the time he or she seeks to commence active employment with Buyer or its designee on his or her Start Date. The Seller Entities and Buyer or its designee shall, and Parent and the Seller Entities shall cause Genclonn to, jointly cooperate to encourage the Potential Phase 1 Transferred Employees to accept on or before the Closing Date the written offers of employment made by Buyer or its designee. In addition to the access provided under Section 6.7(b) hereof, the Seller Entities shall, and Parent and the Seller Entities shall cause Genclonn to, permit Buyer or its designee, with the Seller Entities prior written consent, to have reasonable access to the Phase 1 Eligible Employees in furtherance of this common goal. 

  

 (ii) _Offer of Phase 2 Employment_. Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the applicable Subsequent Transfer Date, Buyer or its designee will offer employment to each Potential Phase 2 Transferred Employee who Buyer expects will commence employment with Buyer or its designee as of such Subsequent Transfer Date. The offers of employment to such Potential Phase 2 Transferred Employees contemplated by this Section 6.7(c) shall be made pursuant to a procedure mutually agreed upon by the Seller Entities and Buyer or its designee and shall be contingent upon each such Potential Phase 2 Transferred Employee satisfying Buyers or its designees hiring requirements at the time he or she seeks to commence active employment with Buyer or its designee on his or her Start Date. The Seller Entities and Buyer or its designee shall, and Parent and the Seller Entities shall cause Genclonn to, jointly cooperate to encourage the Potential Phase 2 Transferred Employees to accept on or 

   #####

employment made by Buyer or its designee. In addition to the access provided
under Section 6.7(b) hereof, the Seller Entities shall, and Parent and the
Seller Entities shall cause Genclonn to, permit Buyer or its designee, with
the Seller Entities prior written consent, to have reasonable access to the
Phase 2 Eligible Employees in furtherance of this common goal. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Employment_. On or immediately after the date Buyer or its designee offers employment to a Potential Transferred Employee,, the applicable Seller Entity shall, and Parent and the Seller Entities shall cause Genclonn to, notify that Potential Transferred Employee of its intention to terminate such individuals employment as of the Closing or the applicable Subsequent Transfer Date, as the case may be, and thereafter the applicable Seller Entity shall, and Parent and the Seller Entities shall cause Genclonn to, terminate all such Potential Phase 1 Transferred Employees as of the Closing and all such Potential Phase 2 Transferred Employees as of the applicable Subsequent Transfer Date. In the event a Potential Transferred Employee has been given less than thirty (30) days notice of termination, the relevant Seller Entity shall, and Parent and the Seller Entities shall cause Genclonn to, pay to the Potential Transferred Employee an amount equal to such Potential Transferred Employees salary in lieu of notice for any period for which the actual notice period falls short of the statutory notice period required by applicable Law, unless the Potential Transferred Employee being a Transferred Employee has waived such notice requirement. In addition, in the event a Potential Transferred Employee does not become a Transferred Employee (as defined below), the relevant Seller Entity shall, and Parent and the Seller Entities shall cause Genclonn to, pay severance to the Potential Transferred Employee as required under applicable Law. Parent and the Seller Entities agree that for purposes of Section 6.5 of this Agreement, each Potential Transferred Employee shall be deemed to be an employee of Buyer regardless of whether such individual becomes a Transferred Employee. 

  

 (e) _Employment of Transferred Employees by Buyer_. Each Potential Transferred Employee who accepts, in a manner reasonably acceptable to Buyer, an offer of employment from Buyer or its designee prior to the Closing Date or the applicable Subsequent Transfer Date, as the case may be (a " _Transferred Employee_ "), will become employed by Buyer or its designee as of his/her designated start date with Buyer or its designee (each such individuals " _Start Date_ "), which shall be on the Closing Date with respect to any Potential Phase 1 Transferred Employee who so accepts the offer of employment and the applicable Subsequent Transfer Date with respect to any Potential Phase 2 Transferred Employee who so accepts the offer of employment. Effective on his or her Start Date, each Transferred Employee will be under the exclusive supervision of Buyer or its designee and, except as otherwise required by applicable Law, subject to Buyers or such designees policies and procedures. Prior to such individuals Start Date, each Transferred Employee shall be under the exclusive supervision of Seller Entities (or Genclonn, in the case of any employee of Genclonn) and subject to Seller Entities (or Genclonns, as the case may be) policies and procedures. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent that any Transferred Employee remains or otherwise performs services on Seller Entities premises on or after the Start Date, such person shall comply with the terms of Seller Entities rules and regulations applicable to vendors, customers and other general visitors regarding such premises. Seller Entities shall provide Buyer with a copy of such policies on or prior to any such Transferred Employees Start Date. For the avoidance of doubt, all such Transferred Employees shall be subject to Buyers, not Seller 

   ##### 

  

 

Entities, written employee policies effective on his or her Start Date. If
any Potential Transferred Employee does not accept Buyers or its designees
offer of employment, then the Seller Entities shall use their reasonable best
efforts to provide a substitute employee with comparable skills, experience
and qualifications, mutually agreed upon with Buyer, who will accept Buyers
or its designees offer of employment and such employee may be interviewed
and hired by Buyer or its designee as if such employee was initially
identified as an Eligible Employee. 

   

 (f) _Reservation of Rights; No Third Party Rights_. Subject to applicable Law, nothing contained in this Agreement shall restrict the ability of Buyer or its designee to terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee for any reason at any time on or after his or her Start Date except that Buyer or its designee shall not terminate any such employee other than (i) for cause for a period of seven (7) weeks from such Transferred Employees Start Date or (ii) within the probation period applicable to such Transferred Employee as permitted by and in accordance with applicable Law. Subject to applicable Law, except as set forth in this Agreement, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates or designees shall be required to maintain any specific benefit plan or other compensation or employee benefit plan, program, policy or practice following the Closing Date. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall create any rights in any person, including, without limitation any Transferred Employee, who is not a party to this Agreement.

 (h) _Critical Employees_. Promptly following the date hereof and through the last of the applicable Subsequent Transfer Dates with respect to a Critical Employee (as defined below), the Seller Entities shall, and Parent and the Seller Entities shall cause Genclonn to, provide Buyer or its designee with access to the Eligible Employees designated on _Schedule 6.7(h)_ as Critical Employees (the " _Critical Employees_ ") for purposes of discussing Buyers anticipated offer of employment to such Critical Employee. The Seller Entities shall use commercially reasonable efforts to retain each Critical Employee until such time as he or she becomes a Transferred Employee or Buyer or its designee determines that such Critical Employee will not become a Potential Transferred Employee. 

  

 (i) _Cooperation_. Buyer and the Seller Entities agree to, and Parent and the Seller Entities shall cause Genclonn to, mutually cooperate with respect to Eligible Employees with the objectives of (i) the Seller Entities (and Genclonn, as applicable) retaining the Phase 1 Eligible Employees through the Closing Date and, with respect to those Phase 1 Eligible Employees who do not become Potential Phase 1 Transferred Employees, later if necessary for the Seller Entities and Genclonn to perform their respective obligations under the Transaction Documents to which they are party, (ii) the Seller Entities (and Genclonn, as applicable) retaining the Phase 2 Eligible Employees through the applicable Subsequent Transfer Date and, with respect to those Phase 2 Eligible Employees who do not become Potential Phase 2 Transferred Employees, later if necessary for the Seller Entities and Genclonn to perform their respective obligations under the Transaction Documents to which they are party, (iii)

(and Genclonn, as applicable) through their applicable termination date, (iv)
encouraging Potential Transferred Employees to accept Buyers or its
designees offer of employment and to commence employment as of the Closing
Date, in the case of Potential Phase 1 Transferred Employees, and the
applicable Subsequent Transfer Date, in the case of Potential Phase 2
Transferred Employees. Such mutual cooperation shall include the grant by the
Seller Entities to Buyer of access to Eligible Employees sooner than
otherwise anticipated by the parties in the event of any unexpected
resignations, rumors, employee unrest, or other events that place the quality
or quantity of the Business workforce at risk. 

   

 (j) _Bonus Payments_. In the event (i) any Transferred Employee participates in any Seller Entity or Genclonn bonus plan, program or policy, (ii) such Transferred Employee commences employment with the Buyer or its designee during the period of such bonus plan, program or policy, (iii) the Buyer or its designee offers a similar bonus plan, program or policy and gives effect to such Transferred Employees time, performance or results with a Seller Entity or Genclonn prior to such Transferred Employees Start Date, and (iv) Buyer or its designee pays a bonus under such plan, program or policy for a period that straddles the Start Date, then the Seller Entities shall reimburse Buyer or its designees for the pro rata portion of such bonus payment within five (5) business days following Buyer or its designees written notice, including reasonable supporting documentation, of the payment of such bonus payment.

 6.9 _Buyer Securities_. The Seller Entities shall not and no acquiring person affiliated with the Seller Entities or any Person designated to receive Buyer Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(e) hereof shall acquire any voting securities of Buyer if such acquisition would result in the ownership of voting securities of the Buyer valued at greater than $65.2 million by an acquiring person affiliated with such Persons, as determined pursuant to the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder.

 8.6 _Securities Matters; Financial Statements_. 

   

 (a) As of their respective filing dates, (i) the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 and all Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings made by it subsequent to that date and on or prior to the Closing Date, as each may have been or may be amended, other than on Form 8-K filings furnished and not filed (the " _Buyer SEC Documents_ ") complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, and (ii) none of the Buyer SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading except to the extent that information contained in any Buyer SEC Document has been revised or superseded by a subsequently filed Buyer SEC Document filed prior to the date hereof. Except to the extent that information contained in any such report, schedule, form, statement or other document has been revised or superseded by a subsequently filed report, schedule, form, statement or other document filed prior to the date hereof, all required reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents that Buyer was required to file with the SEC under the Exchange Act after the beginning of the prior fiscal year and prior to the date hereof complied, as of their respective filing dates, in all material respects, with the requirements of the Exchange Act, and none of such reports, schedules, forms, statements or other documents contained, as of their respective filing dates, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. Except for the execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions to take place pursuant hereto and or prior to the Closing Date, since the date of the most recent Buyer SEC Documents, there has not been any event or development relating to Buyer which, individually or in the aggregate could reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, whether or not in the Ordinary Course of Business. 

  

 (b) The financial statements of Buyer, including the notes thereto, included in the Buyer SEC Documents, as amended (the " _Buyer Financial Statements_ "), complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as of their respective dates and fairly present the financial condition and the results of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flow of Buyer and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as at the respective dates of and for the periods referred to in the Buyer Financial Statements, all in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, except as otherwise noted therein and as otherwise permitted for financial statements filed as part of a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end adjustments that would not be material in amount of effect. 

  

 (c) Each of the principal executive officer of the Buyer and the principal financial officer of the Buyer (or each former principal executive officer of the Buyer and each former principal financial officer of the Buyer, as applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (" _SOX_ ") and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the Buyer SEC Documents, and to the knowledge of the Buyer, the statements contained in such certifications are true and correct. For purposes of this Section 8.6(c), "principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in SOX. Neither the Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries has, since 

   ##### 

  

 

the effective date of Section 402 of SOX, arranged any outstanding,
"extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within the meaning
of Section 402 of SOX. 

   

 (d) The Buyer maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. 

  

 (e) The Buyer has in place the "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(c) and 15d-(e) of the Exchange Act) required in order for the principal executive officer of the Buyer and the principal financial officer of the Buyer to engage in the review and evaluation process mandated by the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. The Buyers "disclosure controls and procedures" are reasonably designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Buyer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processes, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the Buyers management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the principal executive officer of the Buyer and the principal financial officer of the Buyer required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Buyer acknowledges that it has the responsibility to establish and maintain sufficient internal accounting controls and disclosure controls and procedures as described in Sections 8.6(d) and 8.6(e) with respect to the Business transferred hereunder. 

  

 (f) Other than as described in the Buyer SEC Documents, since the beginning of the prior fiscal year, the Buyer has not received from its independent auditors any oral or written notification of a (x) "reportable condition" or (y) "material weakness" in the Buyers internal controls. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "reportable condition" and "material weakness" shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Statements of Auditing Standards 60, as in effect on the date of such notification. 

  

 8.7 _Credit Agreements_. Based upon Buyers results of operations through September 30, 2008, the unaudited Financial Statements provided pursuant to Section 4.4(a)(ii) hereof and any other financial or other information applicable to Buyer, as of the date hereof, no consents are required under Buyers (or its Affiliates) senior credit facilities, or any other credit agreement or financing document to which Buyer is a party that is existing as of the date hereof (the " _Credit Agreements_ "), for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation the making of all payments hereunder assuming that Buyer finances any payments due hereunder with equity and/or subordinated debt financing permitted under such credit agreements or other financing documents. Nothing contained herein shall limit Buyers ability to pursue other forms of financing that may require consent under one or more of such Credit Agreements or other financing documents and any such financing or pursuit of any such consent shall not constitute a breach of this Section 8.7. The Buyer is not in 

    ##### 

  

    

default in complying with material provisions of the Credit Agreements, and no
condition or event or fact exists, or which, with notice, lapse of time or
both would likely constitute, to the knowledge of the Buyer, any such default
thereof on the part of the Buyer.

To the extent necessary to pay all or any portion of the Purchase Price, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to close a Financing (as defined herein) on terms reasonably acceptable to Buyer not less than five (5) business days prior to each time a payment is required to be made pursuant to Section 3 herein, provided that any such Financing shall not contain terms and conditions which are adverse to or otherwise prejudice the rights of the Seller Entities or otherwise limit Buyers ability to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

with employee benefits plans, programs and arrangements (including, without
limitation, retirement benefits, health and medical benefits) that are
substantially comparable to the employee benefits and plans, programs and
arrangements provided to similarly situated (taking into account the
position, tenure, geographic location and other relevant factors) employees of
Buyer and its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (c) _Service Credit and Related Matters_. From and after the Closing Date or the applicable Subsequent Transfer Date, as the case may be, Buyer shall, to the extent permissible under each employee benefit plan, policy or arrangement, (i) provide all Transferred Employees with service credit for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and levels of benefits (but not benefit accrual) under any employee benefit or compensation plan, program or arrangement adopted, maintained or contributed to by Buyer or its designee in which Transferred Employees are eligible to participate, for all periods of employment with the Seller Entities (or their predecessor entities) prior to the Closing Date or the applicable Subsequent Transfer Date, as the case may be (provided such credit does not result in the duplication of benefits for any Transferred Employee), (ii) cause or, to the extent any plan is insured, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its insurance carrier to cause, any pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations under any welfare benefit plans of Buyer or its designee to be waived with respect to the Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent waived under the corresponding plan in which the applicable Transferred Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date or the applicable Subsequent Transfer Date, as the case may be, and, with respect to life insurance coverage, up to the Transferred Employees current level of insurability, and (iii) give the Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents credit for the plan year in which the Closing Date or the applicable Subsequent Transfer Date, as the case may be (or commencement of participation in a plan of Buyer or its designee), occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date or the applicable Subsequent Transfer Date, as the case may be (or commencement of participation in a plan of Buyer or its designee). 

  

 (d) _Severance Matters_. Rather than making severance payment to said Transferred Employees at the time such employees are hired by Buyer or its designees, Buyer agrees to provide, or to cause its designee to provide, to all Transferred Employees credit for all years of service with the Seller Entities for purposes of severance obligations under applicable Law, policy, employee benefit plan, contract, or otherwise; provided that the Seller Entities have not otherwise paid severance to such Transferred Employees in connection with the termination of their employment by the Seller Entities. Except as contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence, neither Buyer nor its Affiliates or its designee shall be liable to, or have any responsibility or obligation to, any person (including any Seller Entity or any current, former or future employee, including any Eligible Employee who does not become a Transferred Employee) for severance or similar payments or obligations, whether under applicable Law, by contract or under any formal or informal policy, practice or plan. 

  

 (e) Buyer and the Seller Entities agree that in the event the employment of, and if applicable an employment contract for, any of the Transferred Employees is terminated or is not renewed at any time during the period of one (1) year and one (1) day after such Transferred Employee is employed by Buyer or its designee, the Seller Entities shall be 

   ##### 

  

 

responsible for the pro rata portion of the severance payable in accordance
with applicable Law for the time period such Transferred Employee worked for
the Seller Entities (or Genclonn), and Buyer shall be responsible for
severance payable in accordance with applicable Law for all periods that such
Transferred Employees actually worked with Buyer or its designee. In respect
of any Transferred Employees who are terminated or whose contracts are not
renewed more than one (1) year and one (1) day after the date of employment
by Buyer or its designee, all severance shall be paid by Buyer, including for
the time period when such employees worked for the Seller Entities
(or Genclonn). 

   

 (f) _Treatment of Employees by Classes_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, Buyer or its designee may provide different benefits, compensation, severance or other arrangements than as contemplated by this Agreement to the members of any class of employees, subject to applicable Law and the agreement to such different benefits, compensation, severance or other arrangements by all members of the class of employees.

 (c) by either the Seller Entities or Buyer by written notice, without liability to the terminating party on account of such termination (provided the terminating party is not otherwise in material default or in material breach of this Agreement), if there shall have been a material breach or default by the other party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein which has not been cured within thirty (30) days after notice thereof by the other party unless the breach arises out of Buyers failure to deliver the portion of the Initial Payment hereunder when due at Closing, in which case no prior notice by the Seller Entities shall be required; 

  

 (d) by Buyer, pursuant to written notice by Buyer to the Seller Entities, if it has become reasonably and objectively certain that any of the conditions set forth in Section 10.1 of this Agreement, other than a condition within the control of the Seller Entities, will not be satisfied at or prior to the Closing, such written notice to set forth such conditions which have not been or will not be so satisfied; _provided_ , that Buyer shall have previously provided at least thirty (30) days prior to delivery of such termination notice the Seller Entities with written notice of Buyers intention to terminate this Agreement; 

  

 (e) by the Seller Entities, pursuant to written notice by the Seller Entities to Buyer, if it has become reasonably and objectively certain that any of the conditions set forth in Section 10.2 of this Agreement, other than a condition within the control of Buyer, will not be satisfied at or prior to the Closing, such written notice to set forth such conditions which have not been or will not be so satisfied; _provided_ , that the Seller Entities shall have previously provided to Buyer at least thirty (30) days prior to delivery of such termination notice, written notice of the Seller Entities intention to terminate this Agreement, unless the condition which is not satisfied arises out of Buyers failure or inability to deliver the Purchase Price hereunder, in which case no prior notice shall be required; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) by either the Seller Entities or Buyer, pursuant to written notice to the other party or parties, if it has become reasonably and objectively certain that any of the conditions set forth in Section 10.3 of this Agreement will not be satisfied at or prior to the Closing, such written notice to set forth such conditions which have not been or will not be so satisfied;  _provided_ , that the party so providing such notice shall have previously provided to the other party or parties at least thirty (30) days prior to delivery of such termination notice, written notice of such partys or parties intention to terminate this Agreement;

 11.2 _Notice and Effect of Termination_. 

   

 (a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Sections 11.1(a) through 11.1(h), written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party or parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made. 

  

 (b) If this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to Section 11.1(g) or by the Seller Entities pursuant to Section 11.1(c) or 11.1(e) (in each case solely if Buyer fails to deliver the portion of the Initial Payment when due at Closing) or Section 11.1(h), or if this Agreement is terminated by Buyer for any reason other than as set forth in Section 11.1 above, then subject to Section 12.1, Buyer shall pay to the Seller Entities 15% of the Purchase Price, as determined by reference to the Final Purchase Price Statements (the " _Termination Fee_ "), in cash as liquidated damages in accordance with this Section 11.2. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Termination Fee, which shall represent liquidated damages, shall be the sole remedy of the Seller Entities in law or in equity with respect to Buyers performance or failure to perform under, or breach of, this Agreement in the event Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(g) or the Seller Entities terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(c), 11.1(e) or 11.1(h) hereunder due to Buyers failure to deliver the portion of the Initial Payment when due at Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that the Termination Fee shall be payable based on the Purchase Price as and at the time calculated pursuant to Section 3.1, but shall be subject to adjustment when the Final Purchase Price Statements have been audited and such financial statements and the audit report with respect thereto has been delivered to Buyer as if the Purchase Price Financial Statements had been audited and delivered in accordance with Section 3.3(a) hereof. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.1(a), 11.1(b), 11.1(c) (except as described in Section 11.2(b)), 11.1(e) (except as described in Section 11.2(b)) or 11.1(f), or by Buyer pursuant to Section 11.1(d), no Termination Fee shall be due and payable. 

  

 (d) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Seller Entities for any reason other than as set forth in Section 11.1 above or (ii) the Seller Entities elect not to sell the Business to Buyer for any reason other than the failure of Buyer to comply with its material covenants in this Agreement (except to the extent such non-compliance does not (x) restrict Buyers ability to pay the Purchase Price or (y) impact the fulfillment of the conditions to the Seller Entities obligation to close on the sale of the Business), then, at Buyers election, the parties agree to arbitration pursuant to Section 14.13. If the arbitrator determines that the Seller Entities and/or Parent have breached their respective obligations under this Agreement to sell the Business, then Buyer shall purchase the Business at a price equal to eighty-five percent (85%) of the Purchase Price notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary. 

  

 (e) Buyer and the Seller Entities acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 11.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; accordingly, if (i) Buyer fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to Section 11.2 to the Seller Entities or (ii) the Seller Entities terminate this Agreement or elect not to sell the Business to Buyer as provided in Section 11.2(d), and, in order to obtain such payment from Buyer or enforce the Seller Entities obligation to sell the Business, the Seller Entities or Buyer, respectively, commence an action in which the party commencing such action prevails against the other party with respect to Buyers obligation to pay amounts due under this Section 11.2 or the Seller Entities obligation to sell the Business to Buyer, as applicable, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other party its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such action, together with interest on the amount due under this Section 11.2 from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at ten percent (10%) per annum (provided that in the case of the Seller Entities failure to perform, no such interest shall accrue on the eighty-five percent (85%) of the Purchase Price payable under Section 11.2(d) hereof). The parties agree that the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 14.13 below shall not be the exclusive dispute resolution proceedings with respect to any action brought by the Seller Entities to recover the Termination Fee or by Buyer to enforce the Seller Entities obligation to sell the Business hereunder. 

  

 (f) In the event of a termination of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall take, and shall cause their Affiliates to take, such actions as are necessary to terminate the PRC Acquisition Agreements. 

  

 11.3 _Effect on Obligations_. 

   

 (a) All obligations of the parties hereunder shall cease upon any termination pursuant to Section 11.1, _provided_ , _however_ , that: 

  

 (i) the provisions of this Section 11 (Termination Prior to Closing), Section 6.6 (Confidentiality), Section 9.4 (Confidentiality) and Section 14 

   ##### 

  

 

(Miscellaneous), including Section 14.13 (Dispute Resolution), hereof shall

 (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party from any liability for (A) any intentional material breach of a representation or warranty contained herein (except for any representations and warranties that are qualified by their terms as to materiality, which such representations and warranties so qualified shall be true in all respects), (B) any intentional failure to perform and satisfy in all material respects all of the agreements and covenants to be performed hereunder and under the agreements, documents and instruments contemplated hereby at or prior to the Closing, (C) any liability under Section 11.2 and (D) any intentional failure to perform and satisfy any other conditions to the Closing contained in this Agreement; and 

  

 (iii) any party may proceed as further set forth in Section 11.4 below. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Buyer pursues its remedy pursuant to Section 11.2(d), the ability to purchase the Business at a price equal to eighty five percent (85%) of the Purchase Price shall represent liquidated damages and shall be the sole remedy of the Buyer in law or in equity with respect to the Seller Entities performance or failure to perform under this Agreement. 

  

 11.4 _Right to Proceed_. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if any of the conditions specified in Section 10.1 hereof have not been satisfied, Buyer shall have the right to proceed with the transactions contemplated hereby without waiving any of its rights hereunder, and if any of the conditions specified in Section 10.2 hereof have not been satisfied, the Seller Entities shall have the right to proceed with the transactions contemplated hereby without waiving any of their rights hereunder. 

  

 _Section 12._ CHANGE IN CONTROL. 

   

 12.1 _Change of Control_. If, prior to the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc. undergoes a merger or consolidation in which the shares of capital stock of Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc. outstanding immediately prior to the date hereof no longer represent at least a majority, by voting power, of the capital stock of the surviving or resulting corporation (a " _Change of Control_ ") then in the event a Termination Fee is due and payable under Section 11.2(b) of this Agreement the amounts payable by such surviving or resulting corporation shall equal two (2) times the Termination Fee that would otherwise have been payable. 

   

 12.2 _Payment Subsequent to Change of Control_. If, after a Change of Control, either Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc. or its successor elects to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder, the Purchase Price payable hereunder shall be paid in cash.

    ##### 

  

     

 13.5 _Notice; Defense of Claims_. 

   

 (a) _Notice of Claims_. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of any claim, liability or expense to which the indemnification obligations hereunder would apply, the indemnified party shall give notice thereof in writing (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the indemnifying party, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party promptly will not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability except (i) to the extent that the indemnifying party shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of the failure or delay in giving such Claim Notice and (ii) that no indemnification will be payable to an indemnified party with respect to any claim for which the Claim Notice is given after expiration of the period for which such claim may be made pursuant to Section 13.2(d)or Section 13.4 (as the case may be) of this Agreement. Such Claim Notice shall state the information then available regarding the amount and nature of such claim, liability or expense and shall specify the provision or provisions of this Agreement under which the liability or obligation is asserted. 

  

 (b) _Third Party Claims_. With respect to third party claims, if within thirty (30) days after receiving the Claim Notice the indemnifying party gives written notice (the " _Defense Notice_ ") to the indemnified party stating that (i) it may be liable under the provisions hereof for indemnity in the amount of such claim if such claim were successful and (ii) it disputes and intends to defend against such claim, liability or expense at its own cost and expense, then counsel for the defense shall be selected by the indemnifying party (subject to the consent of the indemnified party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and the indemnified party shall not be required to make any payment with respect to such claim, liability or expense as long as the indemnifying party is conducting a good faith and diligent defense at its own expense;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the assumption of defense of any such matters by the indemnifying party shall relate solely to the claim, liability or expense that is subject or potentially subject to indemnification. 

  

 The indemnifying party shall have the right, with the consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, to settle all identifiable matters related to claims by third parties which are susceptible to being settled provided the indemnifying parties obligation to indemnify the indemnified party therefore will be fully satisfied. The indemnifying party shall keep the indemnified party apprised of the status of the claim, liability or expense and any resulting suit, proceeding or enforcement action, shall furnish the indemnified party with all documents and information that the indemnified party shall reasonably request and shall consult with the indemnified party prior to acting on major matters, including settlement discussions. Notwithstanding anything herein stated, the indemnified party shall at all times have the right to fully participate in such defense at its own expense directly or through counsel; _provided_ ,  _however_ , if the named parties to the action or proceeding include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct, the expense of separate counsel for the indemnified party shall be paid by the indemnifying party. 

  

 If no Defense Notice is given by the indemnifying party, or if diligent good faith defense is not being or ceases to be conducted by the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall, at the expense of the indemnifying party, undertake the defense of (with counsel selected by the indemnified party), and shall have the right to compromise or settle such claim, liability or 

   ##### 

  

 

expense. If such claim, liability or expense is one that by its nature cannot
be defended solely by the indemnifying party, then the indemnified party
shall make available all information and assistance that the indemnifying
party may reasonably request and shall cooperate with the indemnifying party
in such defense. 

   

 (c) _Non-Third Party Claims_. With respect to non-third party claims, if within thirty (30) days after receiving the Claim Notice the indemnifying party does not give written notice to the indemnified party that it contests such indemnity, the amount of indemnity payable for such claim shall be as set forth in the Claim Notice. If the indemnifying party provides written notice to the indemnified party within such thirty (30) day period that it contests such indemnity, the parties shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement with regard thereto within thirty (30) days of delivery of the indemnifying partys notice. If the parties cannot reach agreement within such 30 day period, the matter shall be submitted to the International Centre for Dispute Resolution for arbitration pursuant to Section 14.13. 

  

 13.6 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. Each of the representations, warranties, agreements, covenants and obligations herein or in any schedule, exhibit or certificate delivered by any party to any other party incident to the transactions contemplated hereby are material, shall be deemed to have been relied upon by the other party and shall survive the Closing until the Indemnification Cut-Off Date, except for the representations and warranties made in Sections 4.3(a) (first sentence), 4.3(c), 4.6 and 4.18, in the case of the Seller Entities, and Section 8.6 with respect to the Buyer which shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, if any (collectively, the " _SOL Representations_ "). The expiration of any representation or warranty shall not affect any claim made prior to the date of such expiration. All covenants herein not fully performed shall survive the Closing and continue thereafter until fully performed. Any investigation, audit or other examination that may have been made or may be made at any time by or on behalf of the party to whom any such representation or warranty is made shall not limit or diminish such representations and warranties, and the parties may rely on the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement (as modified by the Schedules and referenced therein). 

   

 13.7 _Set-Off_. In the event Buyer has made a claim under this Section 13 against any Seller Entity or any other party thereto, and such claim has not yet been resolved as of the date of any payment due from Buyer to a Seller Entity hereunder, Buyer may deposit in an escrow account with a third party commercial bank reasonably acceptable to a Seller Entity and pursuant to an escrow agreement containing customary terms consistent with this Section 13.7, an amount equal to the lesser of the aggregate amount claimed in good faith by Buyer or the amount otherwise payable by Buyer as of such date to be held in escrow until such claim is resolved in accordance with the terms hereof with disbursements thereafter of such amounts to such parties in accordance with the resolution of such claim. If any Seller Entity or any Affiliate thereof fails to make any payment with respect to any indemnification claim in accordance with this Section 13 when such indemnification claim has been fully resolved pursuant to the terms of this Section 13.7, Buyer may, in addition to any other rights hereunder, upon seven (7) days notice to the Seller Entities, set-off the amount of such claim against any amounts payable by Buyer to the Seller Entities under this Agreement, (including, without limitation, payments to be made pursuant to Section 3 hereof). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13.7 to the contrary, (a) the Buyer and each Seller Entity agree that any claim for indemnification by Buyer 

    ##### 

  

    

shall be charged first against any amounts being held in escrow pursuant to
this Section 13.7 and if such amounts are not sufficient to satisfy the
entire amounts payable to Buyer then the amounts shall be charged to amounts
owing to the Seller Entities under Section 3 in the order of the installments
owing thereunder, and (b) Buyers right to set-off under this Section 13.7
shall not apply to any payments due under Section 3.1(a) and Buyer hereby
waives any express or implied right to set-off, offset or similar right in
law or in equity with respect to such payments. For purposes of clarity, any
withholding or offset by Buyer of payments due the Seller Entities
under Section 3.1(a) shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement.
The foregoing shall not apply to any adjustments or other matters
contemplated by Section 3 or the Letter Agreement. 

   

 13.8 _Subrogation_. To the extent that either party hereto (the " _Indemnitor_ ") makes or is required to make any indemnification payment to the other party hereto (the " _Indemnified Party_ "), the Indemnitor shall be entitled to exercise, and shall be subrogated to, any rights and remedies (including rights or indemnity, rights of contribution and other rights of recovery) that the Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified Partys Affiliates may have against any other Person with respect to any Losses, circumstances or matter to which such indemnification payment is directly or indirectly related. The Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnitor to use the name of the Indemnified Party and the names of the Indemnified Partys Affiliates in any transaction or in any proceeding or other Matter involving any of such rights or remedies; and the Indemnified Party shall take such actions as the Indemnitor may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling the Indemnitor to perfect or exercise the Indemnitors right of subrogation hereunder. 

   

 13.9 _Exclusivity_. The right of each party hereunder to assert indemnification claims and receive indemnification payments pursuant to this Section 13 shall be such partys exclusive right and remedy after the Closing for monetary damages exercisable by such party with respect to any breach by any of the other parties hereto of any representation, warranty or covenant, except for Buyers obligation to deliver any portion of the Purchase Price under Section 3, and, Seller Entities obligation to pay amounts under Section 3.3(a) and 3.3(b) or Section 6.7(d) and 6.7(j) hereof. The parties shall be entitled to seek equitable relief with respect to any breach by any of the other parties hereto of any covenants. 

   

 13.10 _Calculation of Losses_. For purposes of computing the amount of Losses incurred by any person, there shall be deducted (a) an amount equal to the amount of Taxes of such person that are actually reduced directly as a result of such Losses, and (b) an amount equal to the amount of any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution payments or reimbursements actually received by such person or any of such persons Affiliates in connection with such Losses or the circumstances giving rise thereto. If subsequent to an indemnification payment any person or any of such persons Affiliates receives any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution payments or reimbursements that would have otherwise reduced the amount of the Loss, then such party shall promptly deliver such amounts to the Indemnitor for such original payment.

Any such assignees shall become a party hereto by execution of a Joinder Agreement in the form attached hereto.

Neither this Agreement nor any right or obligation hereunder may be assigned or delegated by the Seller Entities without the prior written consent of Buyer in its sole discretion;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller Entities may freely assign or pledge their rights to payment hereunder to an Affiliate of the Seller Entities if (a) any such assignment or pledge of the right to

pledge of the right to receive payments hereunder, including the right to

or issued to such party. This Agreement and the obligations of the parties
hereunder shall be binding upon and enforceable by, and shall inure to the
benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective successors, executors,
administrators, estates, heirs and permitted assigns, and no others.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer, without the prior
consent of the Seller Entities, may assign this Agreement and its rights and
benefits hereunder and may delegate its duties hereunder to lenders
providing financing to the Buyer and/or any of its Affiliates. 

   

 14.7 _Publicity and Disclosures_. None of the Seller Entities, Buyer or any of their respective subsidiaries or Affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement or disclosure (including, without limitation, any filing or Form 8-K or any such announcement or disclosure to employees or customers of the Seller Entities) with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of Buyer, in the case of a desired press release or announcement by the Seller Entities, or of the Seller Entities in the case of a desired press release or announcement by Buyer, in any such case which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller Entities and Buyer or an Affiliate may release such disclosures as are required by any applicable Law or regulation, including pursuant to applicable requirements of the securities laws or any stock exchange (including the American Stock Exchange) or self-regulatory organization or any listing agreement with the foregoing, in each case so long as written notice is given to the Seller Entities at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to any such disclosure. Solely for purposes of this Section 14.7, consent of ACON Labs shall represent consent of the Seller Entities. 

   

 14.8 _Captions and Gender_. The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of any term or provision hereof. The use in this Agreement of the masculine pronoun in reference to a party hereto shall be deemed to include the feminine or neuter pronoun, as the context may require. 

   

 14.9 _Monetary Amounts_. All references to monetary amounts, unless otherwise specified to the contrary, are expressed in United States dollars. For purposes of Section 1.4(b) and the representations, warranties and covenants set forth in Section 4 and Section 6 of this Agreement, the rate of exchange applicable to amounts expressed in United States dollars shall be that number of RMB per one United States dollar ($1.00), determined by reference to the average of the buy and sell rate of The Peoples Bank of China rates of exchange 

   ##### 

  

   

in effect as of the close of business (Beijing time) on the business day
preceding the date hereof (which is normally published at the following

_www.pbc.gov.cn/huobizhengce/huobizhengcegongju/huilvzhengce/renminbihuilvjiaoyishoupanjia.asp_
). For purposes of calculating any amounts payable under Section 3.1

of RMB per one United States dollar ($1.00), determined by reference to the
average of the buy and sell rate of The Peoples Bank of China rates of
exchange in effect as of the close of business (Beijing time) on the business
day preceding the Closing Date (which is normally published at the following
website: 
_www.pbc.gov.cn/huobizhengce/huobizhengcegongju/huilvzhengce/renminbihuilvjiaoyishoupanjia.asp_
). 

   

 14.10 _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term: 

   

 (a) " _Affiliate_ " (whether or not such word has an initial capital) of a person shall mean a person that directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the first mentioned person; 

  

 (b) " _control_ " (including the terms " _controlled by_ " and " _under common control with_ ") means the possession, directly or indirectly or as trustee or executor, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management policies of a person, whether through the ownership of equity interests, as trustee or executor, by contract or credit arrangement or otherwise and, in any event and without limitation of the foregoing and solely for purposes of the Transaction Documents, any person owning fifty percent (50%) or more of the Voting Stock of a second person shall be deemed to control that second Person; 

  

 (c) " _Person_ " (whether or not such word has an initial capital) means an individual, corporation, partnership, association, limited liability company, trust or any unincorporated organization; 

  

 (d) " _Subsidiary_ " means any Affiliate of a person that is controlled by such person; and 

  

 (e) " _Voting Stock_ " means, with respect to any entity, securities or membership interests ordinarily (and apart from rights arising under special circumstances) having the right to vote in the election of directors or persons performing similar functions with respect to such entity. 

  

 14.11 _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same document. The delivery of a counterpart hereto by facsimile or other electronic transmission shall be deemed an original. 

   

 14.12 _Amendments; Waivers_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified, nor may compliance with any condition or covenant set forth herein be waived, except by a writing duly and validly executed by each of the parties hereto, or, in the case of a waiver, the party waiving compliance. For purposes of the foregoing, the consent or waiver of any 

   ##### 

  

   

provision by any Seller Entity shall be deemed consent by all Seller Entities.
No delay on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part
of any party of any such right, power or privilege, or any single or partial
exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or
privilege. 

   

 14.13 _Dispute Resolution_. If a dispute arises out of, relates to, or is connected with this Agreement, or the breach thereof, and if the dispute cannot be settled through negotiation, the parties agree first to try in good faith to settle the dispute by mediation in accordance with the International Mediation Rules of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (" _ICDR_ ") before resorting to arbitration, litigation, or other dispute resolution procedure. The mediation will be held in Chicago, Illinois. The mediation will be conducted by a single mediator. The mediation will take place within thirty (30) calendar days of the appointment of a mediator. Within five (5) calendar days of the submission of a written demand for mediation by either party, the parties will exchange lists of three (3) proposed mediators. The parties will have five (5) calendar days to make any good faith objection to any of the proposed mediators. The resulting list of proposed mediators will be submitted to the ICDR and, within five (5) business days, the ICDR will appoint one of the proposed mediators. Upon the lapse of the thirty (30) days or if such dispute arises out of Buyers failure to timely pay the Termination Fee to the Seller Entities as required in Section 11.2(b), either party may require that the parties proceed with the arbitration, in lieu of mediation. 

   

 Except with respect to injunctive relief, which may be sought in a court of competent jurisdiction, as more specifically set forth below, and except as otherwise expressly provided for in Section 11.2 and in Sections 4.4 and 4.5 with respect to financial and accounting disputes, all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to, or in connection with this Agreement or any other agreement executed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement or the negotiation, validity or performance hereof and thereof or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby that are not resolved by mutual agreement shall be resolved solely and exclusively by binding arbitration to be conducted before the ICDR or its successor. The arbitration shall be held in Chicago, Illinois before a single arbitrator and shall be conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the ICDR unless specifically modified herein. Within five (5) business days of the submission of a written demand for arbitration, each party may submit the names of three (3) proposed arbitrators to the ICDR. Within five (5) business days of receiving the names of each partys proposed arbitrators, the ICDR shall send simultaneously to each party to the dispute an identical list of ten (10) names of persons to be chosen as an arbitrator for the dispute. This list shall include the six (6) arbitrator names provided by the parties, and four (4) names chosen by the ICDR. Each party shall have five (5) business days from the transmittal date in which to strike up to four (4) names objected to, number the remaining names in order of preference, and return the list to the ICDR. From among the persons who have been approved on both lists, and in accordance with the designated order of mutual preference to the extent possible, the ICDR will appoint one of the proposed arbitrators within five (5) business days of receipt of the ranked list from the parties. The arbitrator shall apply the substantive laws of the State of Delaware without regard to conflicts of laws principles. The interpretation and enforcement of this Section, and any order or award entered hereunder, shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, without reference to the Delaware Uniform Arbitration Act. 

   ##### 

  

  

 The parties covenant and agree that the arbitration hearing shall commence within six (6) months of the date on which the arbitrator is appointed. In connection with the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall have the power to order the production of documents by each party and any third-party witnesses. In addition, each party may take up to three depositions as of right, and the arbitrator may in his or her discretion allow additional depositions upon good cause shown by the moving party. However, the arbitrator shall not have the power to order the answering of interrogatories or the response to requests for admission. In connection with any arbitration, each party shall provide to the other, no later than fifteen (15) days before the date of the arbitration, the identity of all persons that may testify at the arbitration and a copy of all documents that may be introduced at the arbitration, considered by the arbitrator, or used by a partys witness, or used or considered by any expert. The arbitrators decision and award shall be made and delivered within eight (8) months of the date on which the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrators decision shall set forth a reasoned basis for any award of damages or finding of liability. The arbitrator shall not have the power to award damages in excess of actual compensatory damages and shall not multiply actual damages or award punitive damages or any other damages that are specifically excluded under this Agreement, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any claim to such damages. The arbitrator, however, is authorized to award declaratory relief, regardless of whether the request for declaratory relief involves an actual use or controversy. The arbitrator shall, upon a finding that it is impracticable to meet one or more of the deadlines set forth in this Section consistent with his or her primary obligation justly to determine the controversy before him or her in a timely and reasonable manner, have discretion to alter such deadlines. 

  

 The parties covenant and agree that they will participate in the arbitration in good faith, that they will share equally the fees and expenses of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution and that they will each bear their own attorneys fees and expenses, except as otherwise provided herein. The arbitrator may in his or her discretion assess costs and expenses (including the reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of the prevailing party) against any party to a proceeding. Any party unsuccessfully refusing to comply with an order of the arbitrators shall be liable for costs and expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred by the other party in enforcing the award. This Section 14.13 applies equally to requests for temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief, except that in the case of temporary or preliminary injunctive relief any party may proceed in court without prior arbitration for the limited purpose of avoiding immediate and irreparable harm. 

  

 The parties submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court located in the State of Illinois, the United States of America, for the resolution of any dispute or enforcement of any right arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate and confirmation or enforcement of any award rendered by the arbitrator, and the parties waive any objection to the venue, personal jurisdiction, or convenience as a forum of these courts for such purpose. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties and enforceable in accordance with the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards. 

  

 Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to service of process by registered mail at the address to which notices are to be given. Each of the parties hereto agrees that its or his 

   ##### 

  

 

submission to jurisdiction and its or his consent to service of process by
mail are made for the express benefit of the other parties hereto. 

   

 14.14 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein to the contrary, each of parties hereto will bear its own expenses in connection with the negotiation and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the agreements entered into in connection herewith. No expenses of the Seller Entities, relating in any way to the purchase and sale of the Business or the Transferred Assets hereunder and the transactions contemplated hereby, including without limitation legal, accounting or other professional expenses, shall in any way be charged to or paid by Buyer, or accrued by or reflected in any account of the Seller Entities as of the Closing being assumed by Buyer as an Assumed Liability. 

   

 14.15 _Equitable Relief_. The Seller Entities acknowledge and agree that the Business is unique and that the damages that may result from the Seller Entities failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that damages at law would be inadequate for such failure or breach. Accordingly, the Seller Entities acknowledge that Buyer will be entitled to specific performance, an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief in connection with any such failure or breach. The Seller Entities further acknowledge and agree that this Section 14.15 shall not, and shall not be deemed to, limit in any way any other rights or remedies which Buyer may have at law or otherwise due to such failure or breach. 

   

 14.16 _Further Assurances_. The Seller Entities shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates, from time to time after the Closing, at the request of the Buyer and without further consideration, execute and deliver further instruments or documents to take such other action as the Buyer may reasonably require to more effectively transfer and assign to the Buyer the Business and the Transferred Assets purchased hereunder and all rights thereto, and to fully implement the provisions of this Agreement and otherwise facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 14.17 _Second Territory Letter Agreement_. The parties hereto agree that the Second Territory Letter Agreement is of no further force or effect as of the date of this Agreement and that such parties shall have no rights, claims or obligations thereunder.
