with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, substantially in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1(b), executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of, the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act

shall cease, and GulfTerra MLP shall continue as the surviving limited
partnership in the Merger. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Enterprise MLP, GulfTerra MLP or any holder
of GulfTerra Units, (i) each of the outstanding GulfTerra Common Units other
than the GulfTerra Purchased Units shall be converted into the right to
receive 1.81 Enterprise Common Units, (ii) Enterprise shall assume all of
GulfTerra\'s obligations under all unconverted Series F Convertible Units in
accordance with the provisions of Section 3.3(e) of Annex A to the Third
Amendment dated May 16, 2003 to the GulfTerra Partnership Agreement, as

attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1(b)(ii) and all unconverted Series F
Convertible Units shall be cancelled, (iii) GulfTerra GP shall continue to be
the sole general partner of GulfTerra MLP, and (iv) the    
12     GulfTerra Purchased Units shall remain outstanding and become the
sole limited partnership interest in GulfTerra MLP.   (c) Fractional Units.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) no certificates or
scrip representing fractional Enterprise Common Units shall be issued, and
such fractional unit interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to any rights as a limited partner of Enterprise MLP and (ii) each registered
holder of GulfTerra Common Units exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional Enterprise Common Unit
(after taking into account all Enterprise Common Units held by such holder at
the Effective Time) shall receive, in lieu thereof, from Enterprise MLP in
exchange for such fractional unit, an amount (a "Fractional Unit Payment") in
cash (payable in dollars, without interest) equal to the product of (i) such
fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average of the closing price of Enterprise
Common Units on the NYSE Composite Transaction Reporting System as reported
in The Wall Street Journal (but subject to correction for typographical or
other manifest errors in such reporting) over the four trading day period
ending on the third Business Day prior to the Closing Date.   (d) Certain
Adjustments. If between the date of the Agreement and the Effective Time,
whether or not permitted pursuant to the terms hereof, the outstanding
GulfTerra Common Units or Enterprise Common Units shall be changed into a
different number of units or other securities by reason of any stock split,
combination, merger, consolidation, reorganization or other
similar transaction (other than any conversion of outstanding GulfTerra
Series C Units or GulfTerra Series F Units into GulfTerra Common Units, or of
Enterprise Class B Units into Enterprise Common Units, in each case in
accordance with their terms), or any distribution payable in partnership
securities shall be declared thereon with a record date within such period,
the Exchange Ratio (and the number of Enterprise Common Units issuable in the
Merger) and the form of securities issuable in the Merger shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of GulfTerra Common Units the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event.   (e) Exchange Agent. Prior to the mailing of the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Enterprise MLP shall appoint Mellon Investor
Services LLC to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the payment
of the Enterprise Common Units and any Fractional Unit Payment. At or prior
to the Closing Date, Enterprise MLP shall deposit with the Exchange Agent,
for the benefit of the holders of the GulfTerra Units, an amount of cash
equal to the estimated aggregate Fractional Unit Payment (the "Exchange
Fund") and Enterprise MLP shall authorize the Exchange Agent to exchange
Enterprise Common Units in accordance with this Section 2.1. Enterprise MLP
shall deposit with the Exchange Agent any additional funds in excess of the
Exchange Fund as and when necessary to pay any Fractional Unit Payment
required to be paid under this Agreement. Enterprise MLP shall pay all costs
and fees of the Exchange Agent and all expenses associated with the exchange
process. Any Enterprise Common Units, or fraction thereof, and any remaining
amount of the Exchange Fund or other funds deposited, after the earlier to
occur of (i) payment in full of all amounts due to the holders of GulfTerra
Common Units or to the Exchange Agent or (ii) the expiration of the period
specified in Section 2.1(i), shall be returned to Enterprise MLP.    
13      (f) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Closing
Date, Enterprise MLP shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each record
holder, as of the Effective Time, of any outstanding certificate or
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
GulfTerra Common Units (the "Certificates"), a form of letter of transmittal
(the "Letter of Transmittal") (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Enterprise MLP and
GulfTerra GP may reasonably specify) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificate(s) and payment therefor. Upon surrender to
the Exchange Agent of such Certificates, together with such properly
completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of a
Certificate shall be entitled to a certificate or certificates representing
the number of full Enterprise Common Units into which the Certificates
surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement and the
Fractional Unit Payment, if any, payable in redemption of any
fractional Enterprise Common Unit otherwise issuable. The instructions for
effecting the surrender of Certificates shall set forth procedures that must
be taken by the holder of any Certificate that has been lost, destroyed or
stolen. It shall be a condition to the right of such holder to receive a
certificate representing Enterprise Common Units and the Fractional Unit
Payment, if any, that the Exchange Agent shall have received, along with the
Letter of Transmittal, a duly executed lost certificate affidavit, including
an agreement to indemnify Enterprise MLP, signed exactly as the name or names
of the registered holder or holders appeared on the books of GulfTerra MLP
immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with a customary bond and
such other documents as Enterprise MLP may reasonably require in connection
therewith. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on
the records of GulfTerra MLP or its transfer agent of Certificates; and if
such Certificates are presented to GulfTerra MLP or its transfer agent for
transfer, they shall be canceled against delivery of the certificate or
certificates for Enterprise Common Units and any Fractional Unit Payment as
hereinabove provided. If any certificate for such Enterprise Common Units is
to be issued to a person other than the registered holder of a Certificate
surrendered for exchange, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed, with signature
guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to Enterprise MLP or the Exchange Agent
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of
certificates for such Enterprise Common Units in a name other than that of
the registered holder of the Certificate(s) surrendered, or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of Enterprise MLP or the Exchange Agent that such tax
has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.1(f), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after
the Closing Date to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the Enterprise Common Units and Fractional Unit Payment, if any, as
contemplated by this Section 2.1. No interest will be paid or will accrue on
any Fractional Unit Payment.   (g) Distributions with Respect to
Unexchanged Certificates. No dividends or other distributions with respect to
Enterprise Common Units with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to
Enterprise Common Units issuable in respect thereof and no Fractional Unit
Payment shall be paid to any such holder until the surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.1. Subject to the effect of
applicable Laws, there shall be paid to the holder of each Certificate,
without interest, (i) at the time of surrender of any such Certificate, the
amount of any Fractional Unit Payment to which such holder is entitled and
the amount of dividends or other distributions     14     previously
paid with respect to the whole Enterprise Common Units issuable with respect
to such Certificate that have a record date after the Effective Time and a
payment date on or prior to the time of surrender and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to such whole Enterprise Common Units with a record date
after the Effective Time and prior to such surrender and a payment date
subsequent to such surrender.   (h) No Further Ownership Rights in
GulfTerra Units. All Enterprise Common Units issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.1
(including any Fractional Unit Payment) shall be deemed to have been issued
(and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the GulfTerra
Common Units heretofore represented by such Certificates (including all
rights to common units arrearages), subject, however, to Enterprise MLP\'s
obligation, with respect to GulfTerra Common Units outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, to pay any distributions with a record date
prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by GulfTerra
MLP on such GulfTerra Common Units in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement on or prior to the Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the
Closing Date.   (i) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates
for twelve months after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Enterprise
MLP, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this Section 2.1 shall thereafter look only to
Enterprise MLP and only as general creditors thereof for payment of their
claim for Enterprise Common Units, any Fractional Unit Payment and any
distributions with respect to Enterprise Common Units to which such holders
may be entitled.   (j) No Liability. None of Enterprise MLP, GulfTerra MLP
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any
Enterprise Common Units (or distributions with respect thereto) or Fractional
Unit Payment delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not
have been surrendered prior to such date on which any Enterprise Common
Units, any Fractional Unit Payment or any distributions with respect to
Enterprise Common Units in respect of such Certificate would escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificates shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Laws, become the property of Enterprise MLP,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto other than the holder of such Certificate as specified in Section
2.1(h).   (k) Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Certificates surrendered for exchange by any Rule 145 Affiliate (as
determined pursuant to Section 5.6) of GulfTerra MLP shall not be
exchanged until Enterprise MLP shall have received from such Rule 145
Affiliate the letter referred to in Section 5.6.     15      ARTICLE

each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the

Series C Units and has recommended the Merger Transactions, specifically the
items listed in Section 5.4 to be approved at the GulfTerra Unitholders\'
Meeting, for approval by the requisite vote of the holders of GulfTerra
Common Units and GulfTerra Series C Units, and those recommendations have not
been withdrawn, reversed or modified in any material respect.   (d) Neither

any written notice or claim, or any other information, challenging the
ownership by any of the GulfTerra Partnership Group Entities or the validity

knowledge of the GulfTerra Parties, there is no unauthorized use,
infringement or misappropriation of any of the GulfTerra Intellectual
Property Rights by any third party, including any employee or former employee

being operated in a manner which does not violate the terms of any easements,

be affected by bankruptcy, insolvency or other Laws of general applicability
affecting the rights of creditors generally or principles of equity, and
grant the rights purported to be granted thereby and all rights necessary
thereunder for the current operation of such businesses, except where the
failure of any such GulfTerra Easement to be valid and enforceable or
to grant the rights purported to be granted thereby or necessary thereunder
would have a GulfTerra Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in
Section 3.13(c) of the GulfTerra Disclosure Letter, there are no special gaps
in the GulfTerra Easements that would impair the conduct of such businesses
in a manner that could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a GulfTerra Material Adverse Effect, and no part of the GulfTerra
Pipeline Assets is located on property that is not owned in fee by a
GulfTerra Partnership Group Entity or subject to an Easement in favor of a
GulfTerra Partnership Group Entity, where the failure of such GulfTerra
Pipeline Asset to be so located could reasonably be expected to have,

multiemployer pension plan as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, other than
contingent joint and several liability pursuant to a GulfTerra Plan that is

Enterprise Partnership Group Entities has received any written notice or
claim, or any other information, stating that the manufacture, sale,

Partnership Group Entities as now manufactured, sold, licensed or used or
proposed for manufacture, sale, licensing or use by any of the Enterprise
Partnership Group Entities in the ordinary course of their business as
presently conducted infringes on any copyright, patent, trade mark, service
mark or trade secret of a third party except where such infringement could
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an
Enterprise Material Adverse Effect. None of the Enterprise Partnership Group
Entities has received any written notice or claim, or any other information,
stating that the use by any of the Enterprise Partnership Group Entities of
any trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade secrets, copyrights,
patents, technology or know-how and applications used in their business as
presently conducted infringes on any other person\'s trademarks, service
marks, trade names, trade secrets, copyrights, patents, technology or know-
how and applications, except where such infringement could not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an Enterprise Material
Adverse Effect. None of the Enterprise Partnership Group Entities has
received any written notice or claim, or any other information, challenging
the ownership by any of the Enterprise Partnership Group Entities or the
validity of any of the Enterprise Intellectual Property Rights except
where the absence of any such ownership could not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, an Enterprise Material Adverse
Effect. All registered patents, trademarks, service marks and copyrights held
by any of the Enterprise Partnership Group Entities are subsisting, except to
the extent any failure to be subsisting could not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, an Enterprise Material Adverse
Effect. To the knowledge of the Enterprise Parties, there is no unauthorized
use, infringement or misappropriation of any of the Enterprise Intellectual
Property Rights by any third party, including any employee or former employee
of any of the Enterprise Partnership Group Entities, except where any such
unauthorized use, infringement or misappropriation would not have or would
reasonably be expected not to have, individually or in the aggregate, an
Enterprise Material Adverse Effect. No Enterprise Intellectual Property Right
is subject to any known outstanding decree, order, judgment, or stipulation
restricting in any manner the licensing thereof by any of the Enterprise
Partnership Group Entities, except to the extent any such restriction could
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an
Enterprise Material Adverse Effect.   Section 4.13 Property.   (a) The
Enterprise Partnership Group Entities own tangible personal property
sufficient to operate the businesses of the Enterprise Partnership Group
Entities consistent with past practices.   (b) Except for Permitted
Encumbrances, failures that could not reasonably be expected to have,

defensible title or enforceable rights to use (or,     37     with
respect to pipelines, equipment and other tangible personal property used in

interest in the applicable Enterprise Pipeline Assets sufficient to enable
the Enterprise Partnership Group Entities to conduct their businesses with
respect thereto without interference as it is currently being conducted) to
all their properties and assets, whether tangible or intangible, real,
personal or mixed, free and clear of all liens.   (c) Except for violations
that could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, an Enterprise Material Adverse Effect or as set forth in the
Enterprise SEC Reports or on Section 4.13(c) of the Enterprise Disclosure
Letter, the businesses of the Enterprise Partnership Group Entities have been
and are being operated in a manner which does not violate the terms of any
easements, rights of way, permits, servitudes, licenses, leasehold estates
and similar rights relating to real property (collectively, "Enterprise
Easements") used by the Enterprise Partnership Group Entities in such
businesses. All Enterprise Easements are valid and enforceable, except as the
enforceability thereof may be affected by bankruptcy, insolvency or other
Laws of general applicability affecting the rights of creditors generally or
principles of equity, and grant the rights purported to be granted thereby
and all rights necessary thereunder for the current operation of
such businesses, except where the failure of any such Enterprise Easement to
be valid and enforceable or to grant the rights purported to be granted
thereby or necessary thereunder would have an Enterprise Material Adverse
Effect. Except as set forth on Section 4.13(c) of the Enterprise Disclosure
Letter, there are no special gaps in the Enterprise Easements that would
impair the conduct of such businesses in a manner that would, or that could
reasonably be expected to, have an Enterprise Material Adverse Effect, and no
part of the Enterprise Pipeline Assets is located on property that is not
owned in fee by an Enterprise Partnership Group Entity or subject to an
Easement in favor of an Enterprise Partnership Group Entity, where the
failure of such Enterprise Pipeline Assets to be so located would have an
Enterprise Material Adverse Effect.   Section 4.14 Labor Matters. Except as
set forth on Section 4.14 of the Enterprise Disclosure Letter, none of the
Enterprise Partnership Group Entities (a) is a party to, or bound by, any
collective bargaining agreement or other contract with a labor union or labor

separately the aggregate monetary liability that will be payable under or
with respect to such Enterprise Plans as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as set forth on Section

this Agreement will not accelerate the time of payment or vesting, increase
the amount of compensation due or result in a severance payment for any
Enterprise Related Employee or any current or former director, officer or
employee (or any beneficiary thereof) of any of the Enterprise Partnership
Group Entities.   (b) None of the Enterprise Partnership Group Entities or
any entity required to be aggregated therewith pursuant to Section 414 of the
Code has any liability with respect to or based upon any pension plan that is
or was subject to the provisions of Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code, including a multiemployer pension plan as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA, other than contingent joint and several liability pursuant to an
Enterprise Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA and which has not been
terminated.   (c) Although Enterprise Partnership Group Entities
receive services from personnel on the payroll of Enterprise Parent 1 and
its affiliates, on the Execution Date, none of the Enterprise Partnership
Group Entities has any employees.   Section 4.16 Insurance. Each of the

than the other Party Group, providing for or relating to a Possible
Alternative, (C) to make or authorize any statement, recommendation
or solicitation in support of any Possible Alternative by any person, other
than by the other Party Group, or (D) subject to the fiduciary duties of
Enterprise GP or GulfTerra GP, as applicable, and their respective boards of
directors under applicable Law, to withdraw or qualify the recommendation for
approval of the Merger Transactions by such board of directors.   (b)
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.8(a), each Party Group and its
Representatives shall be entitled, prior to the Enterprise Unitholders\'
Meeting in the case of the Enterprise Parties and prior to the GulfTerra
Unitholders\' Meeting in the case of the GulfTerra Parties, to take
any action otherwise prohibited by Section 5.8(a) in response to any third
party proposal with respect to a Possible Alternative received by any or all
of them if (i) the initial proposal from any third party was not received in
violation of Section 5.8(a) and contains no financing condition (unless the
GulfTerra GP Board of Directors or the Enterprise GP Board of Directors, as
applicable, determines in good faith upon advice of counsel that its
fiduciary duties require it to consider an applicable proposal where the
initial proposal contained a financing condition), (ii) the GulfTerra GP
Board of Directors or the Enterprise GP Board of Directors, as applicable,
shall have determined, in its good faith judgment, that the proposal, if
accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated taking into account all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal, and that such
proposal would, in its good faith judgment, if consummated, result in a
transaction more favorable to the holders of GulfTerra Common Units (other
than the GulfTerra Purchased Units) or Enterprise Common Units, as
applicable, than the transactions contemplated hereby (a "Superior
Transaction"), and (iii) the GulfTerra GP Board of Directors or the
Enterprise GP Board of Directors, as applicable, shall have determined, in
its good faith judgment, after consultation with and based on the advice
of its legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with GulfTerra GP\'s or its Board of Directors\' or Enterprise
GP\'s or its Board of Directors\', as applicable, fiduciary duties to holders
of GulfTerra Common Units or Enterprise Common Units, as applicable, under
applicable Law; provided, that neither Party Group may enter into
negotiations or discussions or supply any information in connection with a
Possible Alternative unless it shall have first entered into a
confidentiality agreement at least as restrictive as the Confidentiality
Agreement, and provided, further, that neither Party Group shall take any
action prohibited by Section 5.8(B)-(D) (except as expressly required by the
immediately preceding proviso) unless this Agreement has first been (or is
contemporaneously) terminated as provided in Section 8.1, Section
8.2, Section 8.3 or Section 8.4. Each Party Group agrees that it will notify
the other Party Group promptly if any inquiry, contact or proposal is
received by, any such information is requested from, or any such discussions
or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of
its     49     Representatives, and thereafter shall keep the other
Party Group informed in writing, on a current basis, regarding the status of
any such inquiry, contact or proposal and the status of any such negotiations
or discussions. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent GulfTerra
GP\'s or Enterprise GP\'s Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14e-2
under the Exchange Act with respect to a Possible Alternative proposal. In
addition, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Board of Directors reasonably
believes that its fiduciary duties so require, Enterprise GP\'s Board of
Directors or GulfTerra GP\'s Board of Directors, as applicable, may continue
to consider any Possible Alternative or Superior Transaction notwithstanding
any Enterprise Reaffirmation or GulfTerra Reaffirmation, as applicable, with
respect to such Possible Alternative or Superior Transaction.   Section 5.9

under Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-3(a)(2) to a partner (or a transferee
of such partner) to equal the Nonrecourse Liabilities allocated to such

to ARTICLE VIII, all rights and obligations of the parties hereto under
this Agreement shall terminate, except the provisions of Section 5.2(b),

termination; provided that nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from
any liability for any material breach by such party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement and, subject to Section 8.10, all rights and remedies of a
nonbreaching party under this Agreement in the case of such a material
breach, at law or in equity, shall be preserved. Except to the extent
otherwise provided in the immediately preceding sentence and Section 8.8, the

sole and exclusive remedy of the Party Group receiving

waiver by or release of any party of any right or remedy which such party may

or omissions or willful misconduct nor shall any such provisions limit, or
be deemed to limit, (i) the amounts of recovery sought or awarded in any such

which any such party may seek against another party with respect to a claim

Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that an award of money
damages would be inadequate for any breach of this Agreement by any party and
any such breach would cause the non-breaching parties irreparable harm.
Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that prior to the termination of this
Agreement, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement
by one of the parties, the parties will also be entitled, without the
requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief,
including injunctive relief and specific performance, provided such party is
not in material default hereunder. Such remedies will not be the exclusive
remedies for any breach of this Agreement but will be in addition to all
other remedies available at law or equity to each of the parties.

the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts
of law. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (a) consents

agrees not to plead or claim in any Delaware Court that such litigation

therefore each such party     63     hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 9.3
Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers. Except for the Confidentiality

prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral
or written, of the parties, and there are no warranties, representations or
other agreements between or among the parties in connection with the subject
matter hereof except as set forth specifically herein or contemplated hereby.
This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by or pursuant to action
taken by their (or their general partner\'s) respective boards of directors,
at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection
with the Merger Transactions by the holders of Enterprise Common Units and
GulfTerra Common Units, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be
made which by Law requires further approval by such unitholders without such
further approval. No supplement, modification or waiver of this
Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the party to be
bound thereby. The failure of a party to exercise any right or remedy shall
not be deemed or constitute a waiver of such right or remedy in the future.
No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall
constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (regardless of whether
similar), nor shall any such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless
otherwise expressly provided.   Section 9.4 Binding Effect and Assignment.
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any person other

assigns, any rights, benefits or obligations hereunder. No party hereto may
assign, transfer, dispose of or otherwise alienate this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) Any attempted assignment, transfer,
disposition or alienation in violation of this Agreement shall be null, void
and ineffective.   Section 9.5 Severability. If any term or other provision
of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any
rule of applicable Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions
of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long
as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party
hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in
order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.   Section 9.6
