<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0 0pt 0.5in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promptly
after the receipt by any Indemnified Party of notice of the commencement of any Legal Dispute against such Indemnified Party by
a third party (including any Governmental Entity) (such action, a&nbsp;&ldquo;<U>Third Party Claim</U>&rdquo;), such Parent Indemnified
Party or Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Stockholder Indemnified Party, will, if a claim with respect thereto is to
be made against any party or Indemnity Escrow Fund, as appropriate, obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to this <U>Article&nbsp;X</U>
(the&nbsp;&ldquo;<U>Indemnifying&nbsp;Party</U>&rdquo;), give such Indemnifying Party or Stockholder Representative, as appropriate,
written notice of such Third Party Claim in reasonable detail in light of the circumstances then known to such Indemnified Party.
The failure to give such notice will not relieve any Indemnifying Party or the Indemnity Escrow Fund from any obligation under
this Agreement except to the extent that such failure prejudices such Party. Such Indemnifying Party or Stockholder Representative,
as appropriate, will have the right, upon written notice delivered to the Indemnified Party within 20 days after receipt of notice
of the Third Party Claim from the Indemnified Party assuming full responsibility for any Parent Losses or Stockholder Losses (as
the case may be), to defend and resolve such Third Party Claim, at such Indemnifying Party&rsquo;s or Indemnity Escrow Fund&rsquo;s,
as appropriate, expense and with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party or Stockholder Representative,
as appropriate. If the Indemnifying Party or Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, as appropriate,
assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate in such defense at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnity Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party or Stockholder Representative,
as appropriate, may not assume the defense of a Third Party Claim (i)&nbsp;which includes criminal charges, (ii)&nbsp;that does
not solely seek and continue to solely seek monetary damages, (iii)&nbsp;that involves a customer, supplier or employee of the
Indemnified Party, (iv)&nbsp;if the Indemnified Party is a Parent Indemnified Party and Parent reasonably believes potential Parent
Losses related thereto could likely exceed the amount remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund or would cause the Parent Indemnified
Parties to lose coverage under the R&amp;W Insurance Policy and provides notice in sufficient detail supporting such claim, (v)&nbsp;if
the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that an actual conflict exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim or (vi)&nbsp;if the Indemnified Party reasonably believes that the
Indemnifying Party&rsquo;s assumption of the defense of such Third Party Claim could adversely affect the business operations or
commercial reputation of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates (the conditions set forth in clauses
(i)&nbsp;through (iv), collectively, the&nbsp;&ldquo;<U>Litigation Conditions</U>&rdquo;). In the event that the Indemnifying Party
or Stockholder Representative, as appropriate, declines or fails to assume, or is not permitted to assume, the defense of the Legal
Dispute on the terms provided above or to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party or Stockholder Representative,
as appropriate, in either case within such 20-day period, or if the Indemnifying Party or Stockholder Representative on behalf
of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, as appropriate, is not entitled to assume the defense of the Legal Dispute in accordance with the
Litigation Conditions, then such Indemnified Party or Stockholder Representative, as appropriate, may employ counsel to represent
or defend any such Legal Dispute; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that Losses will only include the fees and disbursements of
one firm of attorneys for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction in any single Legal Dispute. In any Legal Dispute for which
indemnification is being sought under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, or Stockholder Representative,
as appropriate, whichever is not assuming the defense of such Legal Dispute, will have the right to participate in such matter
and to retain its own counsel at such Party&rsquo;s own expense. If the Indemnifying Party or Stockholder Representative on behalf
of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, as appropriate, has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim as provided in this <U>Section&nbsp;10.3(a)</U>,
the Indemnified Party or Stockholder Representative, as appropriate, may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense
and may participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim (though not as counsel of record, and subject to all privileges);
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that if&nbsp;any of the Litigation Conditions come into existence the Indemnified Party or Stockholder
Representative on behalf of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, as appropriate, may assume its own defense. The Indemnifying Party or Stockholder
Representative on behalf of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, as appropriate, may not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement with respect to any such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party or Stockholder
Representative, as appropriate, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless such settlement involves solely
the payment of money and includes a full release of the Indemnified Party and the Stockholder Representative, as appropriate, in
respect of a Third Party Claim for which the Indemnifying Party or Stockholder Representative, as appropriate, has assumed the
defense. The Indemnified Party or Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, as appropriate, may not consent
to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent
of the Indemnifying Party or Stockholder Representative, as appropriate, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, or Stockholder Representative, as appropriate, as the case may be, will at all
times use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, or Stockholder Representative,
as appropriate, as the case may be, reasonably apprised of the status of any matter the defense of which they are maintaining and
to cooperate in good faith with each other with respect to the defense of any such matter; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that
no party will be required to provide cooperation or furnish any records or other information that would (1)&nbsp;jeopardize the
attorney client, work product or similar privilege of the Person in possession or control of such records or other information
or (2)&nbsp;contravene any confidentiality Contract, nondisclosure Contract or similar obligation of the Person in possession or
control of such records or other information.</P>
